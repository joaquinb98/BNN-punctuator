It  can  be  a  very  complicated  thing, the  ocean  
And  We're  making  the  ocean, pretty  unhappy  in  a  lot  of  different  ways.
People  working  in  these  canneries  could  barely  stay  there  all  day  because  of  the  smell.
We  made  the  ocean  unhappy, we  made  people  very  unhappy, and  we  made  them  unhealthy  
We  see  the  base  of  the  food  chain, the  plankton  the  small  things, and  we  see  how  those  animals  are  food  to  animals  in  the  middle  of  the  pyramid  and  on  so  up.
Now, a  dolphin  mother  dolphin, any  dolphin  --  There's  only  one  way  that  a  Pcb  can  get  out  of  a  dolphin  
And  What's  that  
Here's  a  diagram  of  the  Pcb  load  of  dolphins  in  sarasota  bay, 
And  we  also  are  eating  meat  that  comes  from  some  of  these  same  places.
That's  a  tragedy  for  those  populations, but  It's  also  a  tragedy  for  the  people  eating  them, because  they  Don't  know  that  That's  toxic  meat.
These  same  infections: create  harmful  algal  blooms, 
I  started  out  showing  how  much  we  had  distressed  the  monterey  bay  ecosystem  with  pollution  and  the  canning  industry  and  all  of  the  attendant  problems.
It's  an  ocean  planet, and  we  think  of  ourselves  as  a  terrestrial  species, but  the  pyramid  of  life  in  the  ocean  and  our  own  lives  on  land  are  intricately  connected.
It's  a  huge  driver  for  culture.
The  people  in  these  studies  report  feeling  so  awake  during  the  daytime  that  they  realize  They're  experiencing  true  Wakefulness  for  the  first  time  in  their  lives.
So  cut  to  the  modern  day, 
Okay, We'll  do  something  with  it  
Puppets  always  have  to  try  to  be  alive.
It's  their  kind  of  Ur-story  onstage, that  desperation  to  live  
His  mother  was  a  Puppeteer  
And  in  fact, it  took  about  10  years  to  discover  the  Bambara  Bamana  puppets  of  Mali  in  west  africa, where  There's  a  fabulous  tradition  of  Puppetry  to  learn  a  renewed  or  a  new  respect  for  this  art  form.
So  we  made  a  model  
And  we  had  a  crate  built  for  it.
We  were  going  to  Test-drive  it  on  the  street  outside  of  our  house  in  cape  town, and  it  got  to  midnight, and  we  Hadn't  done  that  yet, 
A  month  later, we  were  there  in  london  with  this  big  box  and  a  studio  full  of  people  about  to  work  with  us.
And  we  went  back  to  cape  town  and  redesigned  the  horse  completely  
And  here  is  our  factory  in  cape  town  where  we  make  horses  
I'd  just  like  to  describe  --  i  Won't  talk  too  loud.
The  ears  are  obviously  a  very  important  emotional  indicator  of  the  horse  
When  they  point  right  back  the  horse  is  fearful  or  angry, depending  upon  What's  going  on  in  front  of  him  around  him.
The  hind  legs  have  got  the  same  action  
And  mikey  also  has  in  his  fingers, the  ability  to  move  the  tail  from  left  to  right  and  up  and  down  with  the  other  hand.
And  together  There's  quite  a  complex  possibility  of  tail  expression  
And  It's  very, very  simple.
But  of  course, it  was  the  cane  is  light. The  cane  is  flexible, the  cane  is  durable.
And  It's  driven  and  propelled  forward  by  new  leaders, like  many  of  the  people  here  by  new  tools, like  the  ones  We've  seen  here  and  by  new  pressures, 
What  it  tells  is  the  story  of  how  today  actually  could  be  as  historic  as  100  years  ago.
Now, this  may  surprise, you  
Now  we  have  wikipedia  
Suddenly, big  things  can  be  done  for  love.
Take  a  look, if  you  Haven't  at  Donorschoose  
The  third  category  is  represented  by  warren  buffet, which  i  call  aggregated  giving  
It's  that  he  challenged  another  assumption  that  every  Giver  should  have  his  or  her  own  fund  or  foundation, 
We  have  got  to  realize  that  it  is  going  to  take  a  long  time  to  do  these  things.
And  That's  where  my  imagined  future  comes  in  which  i  am  going  to  call  the  social  singularity.
We  can  create  a  future  where  hope  and  history  rhyme  
That's  why  i  have  one  last  thing  i  want  to  show  you  
And  they  were  great  community.
I  keep  this  photograph  close  by  to  me  --  It's  in  my  office  --  because  I've  always  felt  a  mystical  connection  to  these  two  men, both  of  whom  i  never  knew  
And  i  want  you  to  imagine  that  It's  100  years  from  now  and  your  grandchild  or  Great-grandchild  or  niece  or  nephew, or  God-child  is  looking  at  this  photograph  of  you  
And  what  do  i  mean  by  that  
And  i  asked  them  to  come  along  with  the  person, they  communicate  with  most  
What  We're  actually  going  to  see  is  that  fundamentally  people  are  communicating  on  a  regular  basis  with  five  six  seven  of  their  most  intimate  sphere, 
He  just  wants  to  wish  her  a  good  day  because  That's, the  start  of  her  day  
They  chat  to  each  other  every  day  a  few  times  a  day  actually  
But  it  could  be  in  a  school. It  could  be  an  administration.
If  you  were  not, you  maybe  had  to  go  through  an  operator  
The  phones  were  there, but  the  expectation  was, once  you  moved  in  there, your  commitment  was  fully  to  the  task  at  hand, fully  to  the  people  around.
This  only  started  about  150  years  ago.
They  were  living  on  top  of  the  workshops  where  they  were  working  
Companies  blocking  access  to  im  or  to  facebook  
How  you  get  it  Shouldn't, make  that  much  of  a  difference  
Now, two  dozen  men  can  tear  down  a  mountain  in  several  months, and  only  for  about  a  few  Years'  worth  of  coal.
Now, judy  and  i  --  i  have  to  say  --  totally  related  to  each  other  
So  Homegirls  and  hillbillies, we  got  it  together  and  totally  understand  that.
And  we  know  that  Eco-industrial  business, these  kinds  of  business  models  --  There's  a  model  in  europe, called  the  Eco-industrial  park, where  either  the  waste  of  one  company  is  the  raw  material  for  another, or  you  use  recycled  materials  to  make  goods  that  you  can  actually  use  and  sell  
And  in  my  hometown, we  actually  tried  to  do  one  of  these  in  the  bronx. But  our  mayor  decided  what  he  wanted  to  see  was  a  jail  on  that  same  spot.
This  can  support  seasonal  farmers  around  Metro  areas  who  are  losing  out  because  they  really  Can't  meet  the  year-round  demand  for  produce  
And  imagine  a  national  business  model  that  creates  local  jobs  and  smart  infrastructure  to  improve  local, economic  stability, 
The  recession  has  us  Reeling  and  fearful  and  There's  something  in  the  air.
There  goes  my  dog, who  led  me  to  the  park  in  my  wedding  
I  started  my  firm  to  help  communities  across  the  country  realize  their  own  potential  to  improve  everything  about  the  quality  of  life  for  their  people.
Hometown  security  is  next  on  my  To-do  list.
The  first  few  systems  that  we  created, they  kind  of  worked  
So  she  expresses  here  what  It's  like  to  see  someone  halfway  across  the  world  having  taken  your  idea  built  upon  it.
And  he  was  a  clever  man.
It's  taken  at  three  o'clock  in  the  morning, without  the  permission  of  the  company, 
This  picture  was  taken  in  1982.
And  when  people  tell  me  Who's  going  to  teach  the  teachers  to  teach  the  kids  
What  he  observed  was  that  kids  who  write  computer  programs  understand  things  differently.
This  is  in  the  early  2000s, my  son, dimitri  --  Who's  here, many  of  you  know, dimitri  --  went  to  cambodia  set  up  this  school  that  we  had  built  just  as  the  school  connected  it  to  the  internet.
I  can  see  any  head  of  state  any  executive. I   want  at  any  time  because  I'm  not  selling  laptops.
If  you  look  at  our  professional  services, including  search  firms, including  communications, including  legal  services, including  banking, They're, all  pro  bono  and  It's, not  to  save  money  
Dual-mode  display  --  that  sunlight, Display's, fantastic  
And  that  was  really  critical.
It  Wasn't  just  to  kind  of  make  it  cute  because  somebody  --  you  know, good  design  is  very  important  
If  You're  in  a  desert, they  can  talk  to  each  other  about  two  kilometers  apart.
Use  your  mailing  lists  people  in  this  room  have  extraordinary  mailing  lists  
And  the  world  production  today, everybody  combined  making  laptops  is  five  million  a  month.
Computers  sort  of  came  around  through  games  and  toys  
And  you  know, the  first  computer  most  people  had  in  the  house  may  have  been  a  computer  to  play  pong, a  little  microprocessor  embedded.
Yeah, There's  38  million  of  them  sold  worldwide, 
Don't  worry, relax, no, relax  It's, a  robot, It's, smart  ,
It  can  withstand  a  400g  shock: the  robot  has  local  intelligence. It  can  flip  itself  over  can  get  itself  into  communication. Range  can  go  upstairs  by  itself, et  cetera.
We  had  the  robots  down  at  the  world  trade  center, late  that  evening  
So  one  year  ago, the  us  military  Didn't  have  these  robots  
He  sort  of  does  that, but  I'm  going  to  --  chris  anderson: I'm, just  british  Rb.
Okay, He's  pretty  good. Yeah. Good. Good.
And  at  different  places  in  that  space, it  expresses  --  can  we  have  the  volume  on  here?
Kismet: do  you  really  think?
Voice  look  at  my  smile, 
Voice, no, no  You're, not  to  do  that.
We  Don't  know  whether  he  understood  or  not  that  the  robot  --  notice, the  Turn-taking  
After  all  That's, certainly  what  modern  molecular  biology  says  about  us  
And  for  those  of  you  that  have  teenagers, you  know  what  That's  like  
And  i  Don't  think  --  --  i  Don't  think  We're  going  to  deliberately  build  robots  that  We're  uncomfortable  with  
And  the  Watchmaker  turned  around  and  said, god  can  see  it  
But  i  felt  something  
Now, you  probably  know  the  answer  to  this  already  
I  remember  it  clearly  
I  thought, well, what  the  Hell's  that  about  
Now, I'm, not  a  neuroscientist, 
And  how  much  of  that  reactive  side  of  it  is  due  to  what  we  already  know  or  what  We're  going  to  learn  about  something  
And  as  we  assemble  these  tools  from  a  design  point  of  view, i  get  terribly  excited  about  it. Because  these  are  things  as  We've  already  said, They're, arriving  at  the  brain.
Now, when  talking  about  beauty, you  Can't  get  away  from  the  fact  that  a  lot  experiments  have  been  done  in  this  way  with  faces.
I'm, not  getting  it  off  the  eyebrow.
Anais  Nin, and  the  talmud  have  told  us  time  and  time  again, that  we  see  things  not  as  they  are.
Ahhhh  
But  i  also  know  why  It's  exquisite  to  me  because  It's  a  Palimpsest  of  things  
I  mean, if  i  just  go  through  some  of  them  now  --  i  know  about  Laminar  flow  when  it  comes  to  Air-piercing  objects, and  that  does  it  Consummately?
Why  would  you  do  that  
Beautiful, maybe  lesser  
Underneath  this, like  the  story  of  the  swan  is  a  million  things  very  difficult  to  do  
So  all  hail  to  that  
The  knowledge  bubble  that  sits  around  the  outside  the  stuff  that  costs  nothing  because  that  knowledge  is  free  --  bundle  that  together. And  where  do  we  come  out?
And  so  I've  stopped  using  words  like  form  and  I've  stopped  using  words  like  function  as  a  designer  
And  for  the  last  decade  or  so  It's  been  quite  clear, what  being  an  atheist  means  
Now, i  think  It's  too  easy  
And  what  I'd  like  to  Inaugurate  today  is  a  new  way  of  being  an  atheist  --  if  you  like  a  new  version  of  atheism, we  could  call  atheism  20  
I  really  like  the  art  of  Mantegna  
I  think  there  is  an  alternative  
We  have  Secularized  badly, i  would  argue  
You  know, the  kind  of  thing  a  Commencement  address  is  and  graduation  Ceremonies. Those  lyrical  claims  that  education, the  process  of  education  --  particularly  higher  education  --  will  make  us  into  nobler  and  better  human  beings.
We  need  data.
And  so  we  need  guidance, and  we  need  didactic  learning  
They'd  go, no, no.
Well, a  sermon  wants  to  change  your  life.
Otherwise  our  minds  are  like  Sieves  
We  associate  repetition  with  Boredom  
We're  just  going  to  run  through  all  the  old  ones  and  watch  them  five  times  because  They're.
The  other  things  that  religions  do  is  to  arrange  time  
All  the  major  religions  give  us  calendars, 
You  Won't  do  that  by  accident, you  will  do  that  because  you  are  guided  to  do  that  
In  the  secular  world, we  think  if  an  idea  is  important, I'll  bump  into  it  
That's  very  good  
In  the  secular  world, you  can  come  through  the  university  system  and  be  a  lousy  speaker  and  still  have  a  great  career.
What  You're  saying  needs  to  be  backed  up  by  a  really  convincing  way  of  saying  it  
After  every  convincing  point  people  will  go  Amen, Amen, Amen, 
At  the  end  of  a  really  Rousing  paragraph  They'll  all  stand  up  and  They'll  go. Thank  you  jesus. Thank  you  christ.
Religions  are  fascinating  in  the  way  they  try  and  combine  the  two  
We  sometimes  hear  it  said  that  museums  are  our  new  cathedrals  or  our  new  churches, 
Art  is  about  two  things  in  all  the  major  faiths.
And  if  that  thing  is  good  There's, no  problem  with  it  at  all  
Art  should  be  didactic  
Whereas  the  people  who  are  selling  us  the  higher  stuff  --  the  therapists, the  poets  --  are  on  their  own, and  they  have  no  power. They  have  no  might  .
But  you  left  out  one  aspect  of  religion  that  a  lot  of  people  might  say  your  agenda  could  borrow  from, which  is  this  sense  --  That's  actually, probably  the  most  important  thing  to  anyone  Who's  religious  --  of  spiritual  experience  of  some  kind  of  connection  with  something  That's  bigger  than  you  are  
Is  there  any  room  for  that  experience  in  atheism  20  
I  would  say  that  there  are  many  many  gaps  in  secular  life, and  these  can  be  plugged  .
And  as  it  happened, i  read  it  from  midnight  to  five  in  the  morning  in  one  shot  
This  is  one  of  the  largest  underground  labs  in  the  world.
There  is  another  way  to  search  for  dark  matter, which  is  indirectly  
When  a  neutrino  hits  a  water  molecule, it  emits  a  kind  of  blue  light, a  flash  of  blue  light. And  by  looking  for  this  blue  light, you  can  essentially  understand  something  about  the  neutrino. And  then  indirectly, something  about  the  dark  matter  that  might  have  created  this  neutrino.
But  nonetheless, It's  an  extraordinary  piece  of  engineering  
Here's  another  view  of  the  same  
The  reason  why  you  have  to  build  these  telescopes  in  places, like  the  atacama  desert, is  because  of  the  high  altitude  desert  
And  remember, all  this  wiring  is  being  done  by  people  in  extreme  cold  in  Sub-zero  temperatures, 
They're  wearing  about  15  kg  of  clothing  and  stuff, but  they  have  to  take  their  gloves  off  in  order  to  do  that.
Anil  Ananthaswamy  and  I'll.
They're  going  to  learn  from  whatever  it  is. They  have  around  them.
It  is  by  far  and  away  the  largest  print  library  in  the  world.
Then  the  question  is, what  do  you  get  
It's  starting  to  be  a  little  bit  more  Specified  
But  i  have  to  say  that  There's  older  technologies  that  i  tend  to  like  
And  it  turns  out  to  not  be  very  hard  
You  can  actually  get  really  good-looking  books  for  on  the  order  of  one  penny  per  page, sort  of  the  parts  cost  for  doing  this  
And  so  We've  tried  that  and  I'll  go  over  that  in  a  moment, 
And  It's  called  the  espresso  book  machine.
And  one  of  my  favorites  in  this  is  the  $100  laptop  
If  you  really  care  about  books  You're  going  to  scan  them  better, especially  if  They're  valuable  books  
So  all  in  all  That's  going  very  well  
And  so  We're  starting  up  a  program  to  do  out-of-print  works, but  loaning  them  
But  it  is  within  our  grasp, technologically  and  Law-wise, at  least  for  the  out  of  print  and  out  of  copyright. We  suggest  to  be  able  to  get  the  whole  darn  thing.
It's, sort  of  the  biggest  tivo  box  You've  ever  seen  
It's  about  a  Petabyte  so  far  of  worldwide  television  --  russian  chinese  japanese  iraqi  al  jazeera, bbc, cnn, abc  cbs, nbc  --  24  hours  a  day  
So  We've  got  about  100000  pieces  up  there.
And  actually  It's  really  been  pioneered  by  Alexa  internet, which  Donates  this  collection  to  the  internet  archive.
If  we  go  and  put  it  in  a  couple  more  places, i  think  We'll  be  in  good  shape.
You'll  eat  countless  gourmet  meals  
Not  likely  
And  this  and  then  this  
Day, 21  day, 23  day, 25  
Fungi  Don't  like  to  rot  from  bacteria.
How  is  that  possible?
The  tallest  plants  on  earth  at  that  time  were  less  than  two  feet  
The  earth  was  struck  by  an  asteroid. A   huge  amount  of  debris  was  Jettisoned  into  the  atmosphere.
We  were  involved  with  several  experiments.
There  were  four  piles  saturated  with  diesel  and  other  petroleum  waste  one  was  a  control  pile. One  pile  was  treated  with  enzymes.
The  mycelium  is  producing  enzymes  --  Peroxidases  --  that  break  Carbon-hydrogen  bonds  
So  i  invented  Burlap  sacks  bunker  spawn  --  and  putting  the  mycelium  --  using  storm  blown  debris. You  can  take  these  Burlap  sacks  and  put  them  downstream  from  a  farm  That's  producing. E : coli  or  other  wastes  or  a  factory  with  chemical  toxins. And  it  leads  to  habitat  restoration.
There's  more  than  a  100  million  colonies  per  gram  and  10  to  the  third  power  is  around  1000  
In  48  hours  to  72  hours, these  three  mushroom  species  reduced  the  amount  of  Coliform  bacteria, 10000  times  
This  is  a  Space-conservative  method  that  uses  storm  debris  --  and  we  can  guarantee  that  we  will  have  storms  every  year  
So  this  one  mushroom  in  particular  has  drawn  our  interest  over  time.
And  a  few  years  ago  we  received  these  results: 
10  or  greater  are  considered  to  be  very  active  
And  so, for  the  first  time, i  am  showing  this  
And  We're  using  a  natural  extract  within  the  same  Dosage  window  as  a  pure  pharmaceutical  ,
So  i  went  to  the  epa  homepage, and  they  were  Recommending  studies  with  Metarhizium  species  of  a  group  of  fungi  that  kill  carpenter  ants  as  well  as  termites  
The  life  box  --  You're  Gonna  be  getting  a  dvd  of  the  ted  conference  --  you  add  soil, you  add  water, you  have  Mycorrhizal  and  Endophytic  fungi  as  well  as  spores  like  of  the  agarikon  mushroom  
The  seeds  then  are  Mothered  by  this  mycelium  
I've  also  lived  in  biosphere  2, 
Well  in  1991, it  was  finally  time  for  us  to  go  in  and  try  out  this  baby  
The  day  i  walked  into  biosphere  2, i  was  for  the  first  time, breathing  a  completely  different  atmosphere  than  everybody  else  in  the  world, except  seven  other  people.
We  were  taking  their  biomass, storing  them  in  the  basement  growing  plants, going  around  around  around  trying  to  take  all  of  that  carbon  out  of  the  atmosphere.
And  we  had  no  clue  where  it  was  
And  that  you  literally  do  that, you  stop  breathing, and  then  you  --  --  take  a  breath  and  it  wakes  you  up  and  It's, very  Irritating  
And  i  Recoiled, they  Stank  
People  Stink  
I  had  no  idea  what  was  in  my  food  where  it  came  from  
And  so  we  sent  one  onto  the  Mir  space  station, 
Shrimp  farms  are  a  scourge  on  the  earth, frankly, from  an  environmental  point  of  view, 
And  understand  its  interactions  with  the  entire  earth, 
Now  it  may  not  seem  like  it, but  we  are  
Thank  you  
What  I'd  like  you  to  do  is  just  really  quickly  is  just  sort  of  nod  to  the  person  on  your  right  and  then  nod  to  the  person  on  your  left  
And  one  documentary  writer, who  was  here  and  looked  at  this  two  months  after  i  was  here  described  this  not  as  Beehives, but  as  a  Graveyard  with  these  empty  white  boxes  with  no  bees  left  in  them, 
It  was  called  that  because  a  guy  in  israel, first  found  it, and  he  now  regrets  profoundly  calling  it  that  disease.
We  needed  Beeswax  for  a  project  we  were  working  on. He  was  so  capable. He  was  able  to  render  the  nicest  block  of  Beeswax. I   have  ever  seen  from  cow  dung  tin  cans  and  his  veil, which  he  used  as  a  screening  right  in  this  meadow. And  so  that  ingenuity  is  inspiring  .
And  we  see  these  families  these  nomadic  families, you  know, father  to  son, father  to  son.
We  have  bumblebees  on  the  top  
Dennis  Vanengelsdorp  bee.
And  in  fact, there  is  now  a  red  list  of  pollinators  that  We're  worried  have  disappeared. And  on  top  of  that  list  are  a  lot  of  these  Kleptoparasites.
There  are  other  animals  that  pollinate  like  bats  and  bats  are  in  trouble  too  
But  I'm  glad  to  say  that  i  think  we  know  the  cause  of  all  these  conditions, and  that  cause  is  Ndd.
And  that  is  make  meadows  and  not  lawns  
Now, not  all  of  us  have  meadows  or  lawns  that  we  can  convert.
And  everyone  should  open  a  Beehive  because  it  is  the  most  amazing  incredible  thing: 
And  if  we  want  to  cure  ourselves  of  Ndd  or  nature  deficit  disorder, i  think  this  is  a  great  way  of  doing  it.
She  Googled  and  she  found  this  world  whistling  championship  in  america, of  course, 
Okay, I'm, not  the  only  one  whistling  here, 
And  i  want  to  first  rehearse  with  you  your  whistling  
I  start  it  myself, 
But  there  is  a  much  more  fundamental  mistake  in  the  overall  story  of  the  ark. That's  not  reported  here.
So  now  we  have  god  that  is  going  to  Submerge  earth  permanently, or  at  least  for  a  very  long  period. And  no  one  is  taking  care  of  plants.
Why  
This  is  not  the  common  man: 
You  know, very  well  about  professors  
When  he  speaks  about  animals, [he]  tends  to  remove  the  fact  that  plants  exist  
The  blue  whale  the  biggest  creature  that  exists  on  the  planet  --  that  is  wrong, completely  wrong.
Some  of  them  are  much  more  sophisticated  
Many  insects  have  been  used  by  plants  as  vectors  for  the  transport  of  the  pollination, but  not  just  insects, even  birds  reptiles  and  mammals  like  bats.
This  is  a  serious  business  
So  we  studied  the  root  apex, and  we  found  that  there  is  a  specific  region  that  is  here, depicted  in  blue  --  that  is  called  the  transition  zone.
Now, we  know  that  a  root  apex  has  just  a  few  hundred  cells  that  show  this  kind  of  feature.
They  work  in  the  same  way.
Well, if  you  want  to  fly  It's  good, that  you  look  at  birds  --  to  be  inspired  by  birds, 
But  if  you  want  to  explore  soils  or  if  you  want  to  colonize  new  territory  to  best  thing  that  you  can  do  is  to  be  inspired  by  plants  that  are  masters  in  doing  this  
It's  much  more  easy  to  work  with  plants  than  with  animals  
Thank  you  
She's  being  filmed  with  a  hidden  camera  
So  She's  noticed  the  unusual  thing, but  She's  gone  back  to  her  normal  life, 
And  We've  continued  to  do  it  every  year  
Looking  at  the  entire  facade  --  there  were  70, total  windows  --  and  i  knew  what  i  had  to  do  
So  then  i  gave  a  new  hand  signal, which  Signaled  the  next  Soloist  down  below  in  forever  21.
This  is  the  best  buy  in  new  york  city.
And  It's  a  very  depressing  place  to  be  in  the  morning  It's, very  crowded  
The  participants  at  improv  everywhere  events  have  just  as  much  leisure  time  as  any  other  new  yorkers. They  just  occasionally  choose  to  spend  it  in  an  unusual  way.
And  i  think  That's, sort  of  the  point  of  improv  everywhere  
There  was  no  way  to  predict  how  far  it  would  spread  through  water  supplies  and  how  bad  the  situation  would  get  
It  Doesn't  require  any  special  training  
It's, a  quite  wonderfully  designed  animal  
They  have  become  domesticated, and  human  beings  have  been  redesigning  their  religions  for  thousands  of  years.
Because  what  I've  been  doing  for  the  last  four  years, really, since  the  first  time  you  saw  me  --  some  of  you  saw  me  at  ted, when  i  was  talking  about  religion  and  in  the  last  four  years, I've  been  working  just  about  non-stop  on  this  topic  
And  you  might  say, It's  about  the  reverse  engineering  of  religions.
And  as  with  the  cow  There's, a  mixture  of  evolutionary  design  designed  by  natural  selection  itself  and  intelligent  design  --  more  or  less  intelligent  design  --  and  redesigned  by  human  beings  who  are  trying  to  redesign  their  religions  
It's  like  a  coin  flip, it  Doesn't  count  really  
Is  it  totalitarian  to  require  reading  writing  and  arithmetic.
I  know, many  religions  are  so  anxious  about  preserving  the  purity  of  their  faith  among  their  children  that  they  are  intent  on  keeping  their  children  ignorant  of  other  faiths.
This  picture, which  i  pulled  off  the  web  --  the  fellow  on  the  left  is  really  an  important  part  of  this  picture.
It  Wasn't, the  cleverness  of  the  sheep  at  all  
If  you  understand  Orgel's  second  rule, then  you  understand  why  the  intelligent  design  movement  is  basically  a  hoax.
Again, and  again, biologists  are  fascinated  with  the  brilliance  of  What's  discovered  
But  the  process  itself  is  without  purpose  without  foresight  without  design  
Well, It's  because  its  brain  had  been  infected  with  a  lancet  fluke  that  was  --  needed  to  get  into  the  belly  of  a  sheep  or  a  cow  in  order  to  reproduce  
The  key  to  our  domination  of  the  planet  is  culture, and  the  key  to  culture  is  religion, 
They'd  want  to  know  how  it  originated  what  it  was  for  and  how  it  perpetuates  itself.
In  that  case, a  parasite  gets  into  a  mouse, and  it  needs  to  get  into  the  belly  of  a  cat  .
But  I'm  not  just  talking  about  islam  
I'm  talking  also  about  christianity, 
You've  all  got  a  copy  
You've  just  heard  the  man  
First  of  all, the  goal  
The  book  is  clear, vivid  accessible  beautifully, Formatted, 
Just  enough  repetition  
And  it  would  just  be  Insincere  of  me, not  to  address  those  problems.
That's  worth  mentioning  
You  could  stop  reading  this  book  because  life  would  have  no  purpose  or  meaning  or  significance.
But  that  is  just  a  difference  of  opinion.
That's, not  what  I'm  really  worried  about  
And  here, i  think  wait  a  minute  
Is  he  Endorsing  creationism  here, 
Your  mind  can  handle  15000  decisions.
Well, There's  a  sense  which  i  agree  with  him, except  i  think  it  has  an  evolutionary  explanation.
Whose  truth  are  we  going  to  listen  to  
And  Here's  one  that  does  concern  me  
And  I'd  really  like  to  get  a  response  if  rick  is  able  to  do  it  
A  very  clever  little  meme, 
In  fact, all  of  you  as  you  sit  here  right  now  are  vibrating.
Every  part  of  your  body  is  vibrating  at  different  frequencies, 
It  looks  a  bit  like  this  
The  trouble  with  widespread  headphone  use  is  it  brings  three  really  big  health  issues, 
It  makes  you  tired  and  Irritable  to  have  to  make  up  all  of  that  data.
You're  having  to  imagine  it  
Professional  hearing  protectors  are  great. I   use  some  all  the  time.
The  Elizabethans  described  language  as  decorated.
Sound  design  is  the  future. And  i  think  It's  the  way  We're  going  to  change  the  way.
It's  a  fantastic  antidote  to  Schizophonia  to  make  music  and  sound  in  a  group  of  people  whichever  style.
I'm, leaving  you  with  a  little  more  birdsong, which  is  very  good  for  you  
We  might  one  day, see  a  shadow, a  black  hole  can  cast  on  a  very  bright  background.
Einstein  realized  that  if  space  were  empty, if  the  universe  were  empty, it  would  be  like  this  picture, except  for  maybe, without  the  helpful  grid  drawn  on  it  
This  is  the  hardworking  scientist  under  harsh  conditions.
He  thought, nature  would  protect  us  from  their  formation.
It's  actually  not  massive  enough  
It  would  be  bad  if  we  tried  to  fire  our  rockets  and  get  out  of  there, because  we  Couldn't  anymore  than  light  can  escape  
Space  Squeezes  and  stretches  as  it  Emanates  out  from  these  black  holes  banging  on  the  universe.
Want  to  get  away  from  the  sound  
Now  that  Chirp  is  very  characteristic  of  black  holes  merging  --  that  it  chirps  up  at  the  end.
There  are  very  industrious  experiments  being  built  on  earth  --  one  called  Ligo  --  which  will  detect  deviations  in  the  squeezing  and  stretching  of  space  at  less  than  the  fraction  of  a  nucleus  of  an  atom  over  four  kilometers.
It's  everywhere, It's  all  around  you, and  the  space  is  wobbling  Chaotically  
Imagine  a  billion  years  ago, two  black  holes, Collided  
If  it  was  the  big  bang, we  were  going  to  pick  up.
And  if  we  pick  it  up, it  will  be  music  to  our  ears  because  it  will  be  the  quiet  echo  of  that  moment  of  our  creation  of  our  observable  universe.
And  our  prison  system  itself  is  stuck.
Funds  for  education  for  training  and  for  rehabilitation  are  declining.
We  give  science  lectures  and  the  men  here  are  choosing  to  come  to  our  science  lectures, instead  of  watching  television  or  Weightlifting  
We  Partnered  with  the  nature  Conservancy  for  inmates  at  Stafford  creek, Correctional  center  to  grow  endangered  prairie  plants  for  restoration  of  relic  prairie  areas  in  washington  state, 
And  just  recently  We've  begun  to  work  with  those  men  who  are  segregated  in  what  we  call  Supermax  facilities.
And  so  what  we  see, i  think, is  that  small  collective  movements  of  change  can  perhaps  move  an  entity, such  as  our  own  prison  system  in  a  direction  of  hope, 
It  Can't  afford  to  doubt  the  person  who  tends  the  child  
That  implies  a  lot  of  trust  
As  the  child  grows, it  begins  to  discover  that  the  person  trusted  is  violating  the  trust  
You  can  be  compassionate, occasionally, more  moved  by  empathy  than  by  compassion.
The  tennis  etiquette  is  both  the  players  have  to  come  to  the  net  and  shake  hands.
Compassion  is  not  defined  in  one  form.
That  means  the  whole  universe  known  things  and  unknown  things  
There's, no  choice  in  this  that  only  confirms  the  reality  that  the  wholeness  Cannot  be  different  from, you  Cannot  be  minus.
You  express  yourself  because  you  have  compassion  
There  is  no  shortcut.
That's  interesting  to  me, 
You  fake  it  and  make  it  
If  you  know  how  to  pray  pray, 
Well, it  has  its  Pluses  and  Minuses  
Therefore, we  Don't  find  the  moral  emotional  psychological  and  political  space  to  distance  ourselves  from  the  reality  of  social  responsibility.
Oddly  enough, an  artist, such  as  myself  finds  herself, also  in  the  position  of  being  the  voice, the  speaker  of  my  people, even  if  i  have, indeed  no  access  to  my  own  country, 
We  are  there  to  take  pride  and  insist  on  respect  
I  envy  sometimes  the  artists  of  the  west  for  their  freedom  of  expression.
Our  people  depend  on  our  artists  and  culture  is  beyond  communication.

Start  Differentiating  into  Effector  and  memory  cells  
We  have  a  million  students  a  month  using  the  site, watching  on  the  order  of  100  to  200000  videos, a  day  
And  then, in  a  response  to  that  same  comment  --  this  is  on  the  thread  
But  the  paradigm  here  is  We'll  generate  as  many  questions, as  you  need  until  you  get  that  concept  until  you  get  10  in  a  row.
In  a  traditional  classroom, you  have  a  couple  of  homework  homework  lecture  homework  lecture.
But  as  ridiculous  as  that  sounds  That's  exactly  What's  happening  in  our  classrooms  right  now, 
So  you  can  imagine  --  and  this  is  what  we  are  working  on  --  is  from  this  knowledge  map, you  have  logic, you  have  computer  programming. You  have  grammar. You  have  genetics.
It'll  change  what  happens  at  the  dinner  table.
Green  means  the  Student's  already  Proficient  
And  the  data  gets  pretty  Granular. So  you  can  see  the  exact  problems  that  the  student  got  right  or  wrong.
And  so  the  same  kids  that  you  thought  were  slow, six  weeks  ago, you  now  would  think  are  gifted  
And  i  think  what  You'll  see  emerging  is  this  notion  of  a  global  One-world  classroom  
I'm  still  doing  all  the  videos, but  we  have  a  rockstar  team  doing  the  software  
And  They're  doing  it  at  the  district  level, 
And  They're  literally  saying, hey, this  is  nice. But  like  that  focus  graph. A   lot  of  the  teachers  said, i  have  a  feeling  that  a  lot  of  the  kids  are  jumping  around  and  not  focusing  on  one  topic.
But  yeah, It's.
And  seeing  with  the  brain  is  often  called  imagination, 
So  i  am  going  to  be  talking  about  hallucinations  and  a  particular  sort  of  visual  hallucination, which  i  see  among  my  patients.
Animals  too  
I  see  cats  and  dogs  walking  towards  me.
She  said, It's  got  color, It's  got  motion, 
I  said, there  is  a  special  form  of  visual  hallucination, which  may  go  with  deteriorating  vision  or  blindness  
And  you  have  charles  bonnet  syndrome  
And  about  10  percent  of  the  visually  impaired  people  get  visual  hallucinations  
Now  with  the  original  description, in  the  18th  century, charles  bonnet  did  not  have  them  
On  one  occasion, he  saw  a  man  in  a  Bathrobe  smoking, a  pipe  and  realized  it  was  himself.
These  cartoons  would  be  transparent  and  would  cover  half  the  visual  field  like  a  screen  
But  what  did  disturb  her  was  she  got  very  persistent  images  or  hallucinations  of  faces. And  as  with  rosalie, the  faces  were  often  deformed  with  very  large  teeth, or  very  large  eyes.
In  particular, the  notion  is  that  if  you  see  things  or  hear  things  You're  going  mad, but  the  psychotic  hallucinations  are  quite  different  .
And  in  particular, one  area  of  the  temporal  lobe  is  called  the  fusiform  gyrus.
And  now  we  know  that  there  are  hundreds  of  other  sorts  of  cells, which  can  be  very, very  specific  
Well, I've  more  or  less  said, what  i  wanted  
But  they  stop  there  
Well, they  Don't  disturb  me  any  more  than  my  Tinnitus, which  i  ignore  
They  occasionally  interest  me, and  i  have  many  pictures  of  them  in  my  notebooks  
So  It's, a  Little-appreciated  fact  that  most  of  the  animals  in  our  ocean, make  light  
I've  spent  most  of  my  career  studying  this  phenomenon  called  bioluminescence  
I  also  use  it  as  a  tool  for  visualizing  and  tracking  pollution.
This  is  the  first  time  it  has  ever  been  recorded  
So  that  light  was  made  by  a  bioluminescent  Dinoflagellate, a  single-celled  alga  
There's  a  lot  of  animals  that  use  this  trick, for  example, this  black  Dragonfish  
It's  got  a  light  organ  under  its  eye.
It's  a  scream  for  help  It's  meant  to  attract  attention, 
There's  other  ways  you  can  defend  yourself  with  light  
This  little  squid  is  called  the  fire  Shooter  because  of  its  ability  to  do  this  
This  is  a  golden  coral, a  bush  
We're  talking  to  something  
But  He's  persistent  
We  need  more  eyes  on  the  process.
Scientists  have  always  created  pictures  as  part  of  their  thinking  and  discovery  process  
In  the  top  left-hand  corner, You've  got  this  yellow-green  area  
And  those  red  molecules  are  hemoglobin, 
And  hemoglobin  acts  as  a  molecular  sponge  to  soak  up  the  oxygen  in  your  lungs, and  then  carry  it  to  other  parts  of  the  body  
And  That's  how  i  really  began.
Those  are  the  letters  of  genetic  code, the  25000  genes  You've  got  written  in  your  dna  
But  they  physically  run  in  opposite  directions, which  creates  a  number  of  complications  for  your  living  cells  as  You're  about  to  see  most, particularly  when  dna  is  being  copied  
And  so  what  I'm  about  to  show  you  is  an  accurate  representation  of  the  actual  dna  replication  machine, That's  occurring, right  now  inside  your  body, at  least  2002  biology, 
And  It's  Jiggling  and  Wiggling  there  because  of  the  surrounding  soup  of  molecules  which  I've  stripped  away.
But  in  each  one  of  your  cells, each  strand  of  dna  is  about  30  to  40  million  nanometers  long  
It  is  made  up  of  about  200  different  types  of  proteins  thousands  of  proteins  in  total  
That  is  the  signal  broadcasting  system  sending  out  the  stop  signal  
This  is  how  you  work  at  the  molecular  scale.
And  we  Don't  know  exactly  how  they  did  this, although  they  must  have  solved  some  collective  action  problems. It  only  makes  sense  that  you  Can't  hunt, Mastodons  while  You're  fighting  with  the  other  groups.
So  that  raised  a  social  question  that  i  believe  must  have  driven  new  social  forms, 
Again, we  Can't  know, but  we  can  be  pretty  sure  that  some  form  of  symbolic  communication  must  have  been  involved.
We  saw  scientific  revolutions  the  protestant  reformation  constitutional  democracies  possible, where  they  had  not  been  possible  before  
I'm  going  to  talk  briefly  about  two  of  them, the  Prisoner's  dilemma  and  the  tragedy  of  the  commons  
Garrett  Hardin  used  it  to  talk  about  Overpopulation  in  the  late  1960s  
And  most  recently, Neurophysiological  measures  have  shown  that  people  who  punish  cheaters  in  economic  games  show  activity  in  the  reward  centers  of  their  brain.
Jim  Surowiecki  briefly  mentioned  yochai  Benkler's  paper  about  open  source, pointing  to  a  new  form  of  production, peer-to-peer  production  
Toyota  instead  of  treating  its  suppliers  as  a  marketplace  treats  them  as  a  network  and  trains  them  to  produce  better, even  though  they  are  also  training  them  to  produce  better  for  their  competitors.
I  Don't  think, We've  even  begun  to  discover  what  the  basic  principles  are. But  i  think  we  can  begin  to  think  about  them.
I  believe  that  the  payoff  would  be  very  big  
What  forms  of  suffering  could  be  Alleviated, what  forms  of  wealth  could  be  created  if  we  knew  a  little  bit  more  about  cooperation, 
I  Don't  think  that  this  Transdisciplinary  discourse  is  automatically  going  to  happen  It's  going  to  require  effort  
I'm  not  going  to  dive  into  them  either, but  Photosynths  are  integrated  into  the  map.
So  this  is  something  that  We're  now  going  to  try  for  the  first  time  live.
No, no  the  other  way, 
This  is  the  current  --  thank  you  --  this  is  the  current  time  if  we  Scrub  the  time, then  we  can  see  how  the  sky  will  look  at  different  times, and  we  can  get  all  of  this  very  detailed  information  about  different  times.
All  right  now, I've  Overrun  my  time.
Sophal  ear  so  notwithstanding  the  1970s  narration: on  april  17th, 1975, we  lived  in  phnom  penh  
They  were  young  soldiers, typically  child  soldiers, 
So  the  khmer  rouge  took  us  from  a  place  called  pursat  to  Kaoh  Tiev, which  is  across  from  the  border  from  vietnam  
And  we  end  up  in  hong  Ngu  on  the  vietnamese  side, 
And  then  onwards  to  Chau  doc  ,
Thank  you  mother  
Somebody  has  to  be  a  witness  to  what  has  happened  to  you  
And  one  evening, i  was  sitting  next  to  a  very  nice  gentleman  in  kabul. And  he  asked  what  i  thought  would  be  good  in  afghanistan.
This  was  our  sign  --  It's  Hand-painted, and  we  had  45  all  over  kabul  
We  developed  a  Culturally-sensitive  psycho-social  counseling  approach, 
And  now  you  are  helping  me  to  regain  some  confidence  in  the  future.
Child  there  is  no  difference  here  between  classes  nor  white  or  black, nor  if  you  have  money  or  not  
Simply  if  you  are  talented, if  you  have  the  Vocation  and  the  will  to  be  here, you  get  in  you  share  with  us  and  make  music  
In  its  essence, the  orchestra  and  the  choir  are  much  more  than  artistic  structures  
That's  how  they  build  a  spirit  of  solidarity  and  Fraternity  among  them, develop  their  self-esteem  and  foster  the  ethical  and  Aesthetical  values  related  to  the  music  in  all  its  senses.
All  this  makes  up  a  constructive  and  Ascending  social  dynamic  
It's, what  makes  a  little  girl  play, the  Clarinet  at  home, while  her  mother  does  the  housework  
And  these  will  be  some  simple  design  qualities, and  they  will  also  be  some  qualities  of  if  you  will  the  intelligence  of  interaction  
Now, We've, put  people  18  inches  in  front  of  a  tv  and  all  the  artifacts  that  none  of  the  original  designers  expected  to  be  seen. All  of  a  sudden  are  staring  you  in  the  face.
And  my  favorite  example  is  always  fingers  
In  fact, They're  not  It's, really  a  very, very  high-resolution  input  medium  --  you  have  to  just  do  it  twice. You  have  to  touch  the  screen  and  then  rotate  your  finger  slightly  --  and  you  can  move  a  cursor  with  great  accuracy.
And  we  have  never  known  how  to  do  this  technically.
Ok, so  there  is  the  pressure-sensitive  display  in  operation, 
The  Person's, just  if  you  will  pushing  on  the  screen  to  make  a  curve  
And  what  you  can  do  --  oops, i  Didn't  mean  to  do  that  --  what  you  can  do  is  actually  feed  back  to  the  user, the  feeling  of  the  physical  properties.
What  I'll  show  you  very  quickly  is  a  new  kind  of  book  where  it  is  mixed  now  with  all  sorts  of  things  live  in  there.
So  it  knows, or  at  least  there  is  Computer-readable  information  in  the  medium  itself.
Now  that  would  be  if  you  will  the  top  green  track, which  Doesn't  mean  too  much, but  you  might  have  to  elaborate  for  me, or  for  somebody  who  Isn't  an  expert  and  say, cook  at  380  degrees  for  45  minutes.
If  You're  in  a  classroom  situation  and  somebody  asks  a  question, the  last  thing  you  do  is  repeat  what  you  just  said, 
He  says, well, reading  is  this  junk?
And  that  story  has  many  other  anecdotes  that  are  similar, but  wow, the  key  to  the  future  of  computers  in  education  is  right  there.
What  the  truth  is  is  that  speaking  has  great  value  to  a  child, the  child  can  get  a  great  deal  by  talking  to  you  
Well  in  senegal, we  found  that  this  was  the  traditional  classroom, 120  kids  --  three  per  desk  --  one  teacher: a  little  bit  of  chalk, 
That's, what  meant  something  to  her  is  doing  the  hair  pattern  and  actually  did  it  within  two  days  --  an  hour  each  day  --  and  found  it  was  to  her, absolutely  the  most  meaningful  piece, 
And  my  last  example  --  as  some  of  my  former  colleagues  whom  i  see  in  the  room  can  imagine  what  it  will  be  
Now  that  is  sufficiently  Zany  that  we  would  obviously  jump  to  the  bait, and  we  did  
So  if  i  all  of  a  sudden  turn  to  the  person  to  my  left  and  start  talking  to  that  person, then  at  the  person  to  my  Right's  site  He'll, see  these  two  plastic  heads  talking  to  each  other  
And  then, if  that  person  interrupts, then  those  two  heads  may  turn  
We're  testing  these  kinds  of  simple  Sensor-network  technologies  in  the  home.
And  as  we  monitor  phone  usage  by  seniors  over  a  long  period  of  time  down  to  the  Tenths  of  a  Microsecond  that  recognition  moment  of  whether  they  can  figure  out  that  person  on  the  other  end  is  a  friend, and  we  start  talking  to  them  immediately, or  they  do  a  lot  of  What's  called  trouble. Talk  where  They're  like  wait, who  is  this? Oh  right?
So  sensors  are  looking  at  that  kind  of  voice  
If  they  have  a  hip  fracture, we  go  with  them, and  we  study  their  entire  discharge  experience.
This  is  50  Tsunamis  scheduled  on  the  calendar. But  somehow  we  Can't  sort  of  Marshal  our  government  and  innovative  forces  to  sort  of  get  out  in  front  of  it  and  do  something  about  it. We'll, wait  until  It's, more  of  a  catastrophe  and  react, as  opposed  to  prepare  for  it.
This  mentality  of  traveling  to  and  Timesharing  large, expensive  healthcare  systems  actually  began  in  1787  
We  have  to  shift  from  this  mainframe  mentality  of  healthcare  to  a  personal  model  of  healthcare, 
How  do  we  collect  not  just  biological  data, but  behavioral  data  psychological  data, relational  data  in  and  on  and  around  the  home  
They  fixed  her  back  up, she  was  never  going  to  be  able  to  move  back  into  the  assisted  living. They  put  her  into  the  nursing  home  unit.
I'm, not  Bragging  about  how  much  we  fund  It's, how  little  anyone  else  actually  pays  attention  to  aging  and  funds  innovation  on  aging, chronic  disease  management  and  independent  living  in  the  home  
And  so  That's, what  I've  been  striving  for  all  of  my  life  
But  instead, i  go  out  and  i  find  things  
Then  i  just  pick  things  up  
And  so  at  that  time, i  was  able  to  make  some  interesting  hypotheses  along  with  my  colleagues  
The  appearance  of  them  would  have  been  different  --  which  it  is  in  all  social  animals, 
In  social  groups  of  animals, the  juveniles  always  look  different  than  the  adults  
And  probably  a  whole  bunch  of  trees  as  well  
Now  it  Wasn't  dna, she  Didn't  find  dna  
We  gave  samples  to  mary  Schweitzer, and  she  was  actually  able  to  determine  that  b-rex  was  a  female  based  on  Medullary  tissue  found  on  the  inside  of  the  bone  
And  so  we  built  a  laboratory  in  the  back  of  an  18-wheeler  trailer  and  actually  took  the  laboratory  to  the  field  where  we  could  get  better  samples.
I  mean, it  was  wonderful  stuff.
So  That's, what  I'm  here  to  tell  you  about  how  we  are  going  to  fix  a  chicken  
We  started  out  with  a  Wolf-like  creature, and  we  ended  up  with  a  maltese  .
And  so  That's  what  We're  looking  into  
Archaeopteryx, which  is  a  bird, a  primitive  bird.
It  has  the  three  fingers, the  three  digits  
Birds  have  basically  rudimentary  tails  
But  a  gene  turns  on  and  Resorbs, the  tail  gets  rid  of  it  
And  people  always  say, why  do  that  
What  the  frigoris  you  doing  names  are  important  
Now, frank  is  this  clear  to  you  djabran  fluctus  
Listen  I'm, going  back  to  the  swamp  mermaid.
So  these  are  actual  names  of  people  that  work  there.
I  did  some  more  investigation  
There  are  some  mapping  people  who  do  use  their  names.
So  formulas  relate  number  to  form  
They  got  little  babies  in  there  floating  in  there.
It's  a  different  kind, of  course, and  They've  got  five  apples  
Because  That's, why  We're  here, really, i  think  to  figure  stuff  out  and  to  love  each  other  
They  are  so  different  
Bode's  law  Wasn't, even  his  law.
Just  a  correlation  that  indicates  how  things  are  Misinterpreted  
Golden  section  I've  been  obsessed  with  this  thing  since  before  i  was  born  
I  know  that  scares  a  lot  of  you, but  that  was  my  purpose.
If  Fibonacci  had  been  on  Paxil, that  would  be  the  Fibonacci  series  
Yes, mama  
There  is  so  many  intricate  relationships  that  I'm  not  going  to  go  there  now, because  you  would  say, hey, go  back  to  the  fluctus  part  
And  I'm  presenting  it  here  at  ted.
It  just  seems  like  It's, not  sexy  and  elegant, It's, hidden  
And  look  at  this  built  within  it  is  the  golden  ratio  
Thank  you  
Good  afternoon, 
In  1982, in  the  middle  of  the  cold  war  in  soviet  siberia, a  pipeline  exploded  with  a  burst  of  3, Kilotons, the  equivalent  of  a  fourth  of  the  hiroshima  bomb  
And  with  these  keys, they  may  have  been  able  to  get  inside  Centcom's  systems  to  see  and  hear  everything, and  maybe  even  infect  some  of  them.
As  a  result, the  americans  take  the  threat  very  seriously.
I'll, quote, general  james  Cartwright, vice  chairman  of  the  joint  chiefs  of  staff, who  says  in  a  report  to  congress  that  cyberattacks  could  be  as  powerful  as  weapons  of  mass  destruction, 
Moreover, the  americans  have  decided  to  spend  over  30  billion  dollars  in  the  next  five  years  to  build  up  their  cyberwar  capabilities  
Cyber  weapons  have  this  peculiar  feature?
Cartoons  are  basically  short  stories.
And  that  prompted  people  to  make  maps  like  this  with  all  kinds  of  wonderful  detail  on  the  land. But  when  you  get  to  the  waters  edge, the  ocean  looks  like  one  giant  puddle  of  blue  paint.
And  best  of  all, i  saw  the  animals  
Could  you  image  if  we  looked  through  the  hubble  telescope, and  we  saw  that  
It  would  start  a  whole  new  space  race, 
For  instance, take  these  sea  turtles, 
They  kind  of  have  a  sixth  sense  like  Superman's, x-ray  vision, 
They  can  sense  the  magnetic  fields  of  the  earth  
Or  take  this  sea  Cucumber  
He's, sort  of  a  homer  simpson  with  fins  
He  goes  down, and  he  meets  this  famous  Anglerfish  
The  third  storyline, i  did  about  a  year.
I  do  three  or  four  strips  after  that  where  we  explore  the  finning  issue  and  the  shark  fin  soup  issue  
There  was  a  real  website  based  in  china  that  actually  sold  shark  fins.
And  you  see, you  have  a  beautiful  piece  of  white  Alabaster  
So  you  say, to  yourself, well, That's  worth  something  
So  you  go  back  into  the  room, and  you  break  this  thing  to  pieces  and  you  haul  it  away.
Thanks  for  listening  
Audience: 22, 
Audience: 47, 
Woman, no  
594, Let's, give  three  of  them  a  nice  round  of  applause. There.
What  I'm  going  to  try  and  do  then  --  i  notice  that  took  some  of  you  a  little  bit  of  time  to  get  your  answer  
Audience: 23, 
Audience: 59, 
95218564  
Eight-digit  capacity  --  Don't, you  hate  that  
In  the  meanwhile, let  me  conclude  the  first  part  of  my  show  by  doing  something, a  little  trickier  
Really  scramble  them  up  this  time, please  
For  my  next  number  --  while  i  mentally  recharge  my  batteries, i  have  one  more  question  for  the  audience: 
Let's  see, starting  with  --  Let's  start  with  a  gentleman  first. Ok, sir? What  year  was  it?
Yell  it  out  what  year  audience: 1959.
1959, ok  --  and  the  month  
Audience  may  ab  may  what  
It  was  ab, and  it  was  cloudy  
57683  squared, yuck, 
I'm  going  to  break  the  problem  down  into  three  parts.
I'll.
While  i  explain  something  else  --  --  i  know  that  you  can  use  right  
That  seems  right  I'll  go  on  cookie, fission, ok, 
A  third  time, It's, just  being  a  technician, 
So  I'm  not  going  to  talk  about  that  
Get  them  out  of  schools  and  keep  them  out  of  schools.
Having  said  that  i  outlined  my  talk  about  five  minutes  ago, 
No  if  you  want  to  know  what  Society's  going  to  be  like  in  20  years, ask  a  kindergarten  teacher  
But  to  me  things  Aren't, the  future  
Right  away, i  hope  that  all  of  your  eyes  glaze  over  
This  is  a  klein  bottle  
It's, one, Sided, It's, a  bottle  whose  inside  is  its  outside  
It  has  zero  volume  and  It's  Non-orientable  
It  has  wonderful  properties.
That  was  a  month  of  my  life.
Oh  cool, i  can  get  to  this  place  over  here, right?
I  take  lunch  hour, 
One  of  the  things  that  I've  done  for  my  science  students  is  to  tell  them  look  I'm  going  to  teach  you  College-level  physics, 
Is  a  constant  when  the  frequency  goes  up. The  wavelength  comes  down. Wavelength  goes  up  frequency  goes  down.
Now  so  i  know  the  frequency  
Those  of  you  who  are  physicists, i  hear  you  rolling  your  eyes, but  bear  with  me  
It's  one  of  these  Bell-tower  buildings  
I  keep  climbing  up, go  back  
A  dome  one  of  these  Ten-foot  domes  
In  this  light  may  science  and  religion  endeavor  here  for  the  steady  evolution  of  mankind  from  darkness, to  light  from  Narrowness  to  Broad-mindedness  from  prejudice  to  tolerance  
It's  time  for  me  to  let  it  go  
We  want  space  efficiency, 
Finally, we  want  Multifunctional  spaces  and  Housewares  --  a  sink  combined  with  a  toilet, a  dining  table  becomes  a  bed  --  same  space, a  little  side  table  stretches  out  to  seat  10  
Guests  move  the  moving  wall  have  some  Fold-down  guest  beds, 
Thank  you  
Seriously, but  dangerously  fun  
And  there  it  is, and  i  think  this  is  a  typical  picture  of  what  it  was  like  in  a  courtyard, then  
So  I'm  Gonna  take  you  through  what  i  think  is  a  remarkable  sequence.
Any  of  you  Who've  been  to  africa  or  had  a  junkyard  dog, come  after  you. There  is  a  fixed  kind  of  predatory  gaze  that  you  know, You're  in  trouble.
And  this  polar  bear  stands  over  the  husky, no  claws  extended, no  fangs, taking  a  look  
And  It's  that  state  that  allows  these  two  creatures  to  explore  the  possible  
They  are  beginning  to  do  something  that  neither  would  have  done  without  the  play  signals.
And  it  is  a  marvelous  example  of  how  a  differential  in  power  can  be  Overridden  by  a  process  of  nature  That's  within  all  of  us, 
John  mentioned  that  I've  done  some  work  with  murderers.
If  You're  having  a  bad  day, try  this  jump  up  and  down  wiggle  around  --  You're  going  to  feel  better  
But  it  has  to  be  safe  exploration.
But  if  you  look  closely  They're, kind  of  like  the  polar  bear  and  husky  no  claws, flat  fur, soft  eyes, open  mouth  with  no  fangs, Balletic, movements, Curvilinear  movements  --  all  specific  to  play  
We  all  have  an  internal  narrative, That's  our  own  inner  story.
We  Don't  know  a  whole  lot  about  what  it  does  for  the  human  brain, because  funding  has  not  been  exactly  heavy  for  research  on  play.
I  think  that  --  That's  a  few  years  back  --  i  think  that  wave  is  past, and  the  play  wave  is  Cresting, because  there  is  some  good  science.
Now, the  program  says  that  the  opposite  of  play  is  not  work, It's, depression, 
Nobody  misses  that  dog. I   took  a  picture  of  on  a  Carmel  beach.
You  may  not  know  this  word, but  it  should  be  your  biological  first  name  and  last  name  
Found  that  when  he  looked  at  a  playground  out  of  a  window  into  which  he  had  been  confined, he  felt  something  different  .
And  looking  at  his  history, which  is  common  in  the  press, it  seems  to  me  at  least  --  looking  at  it  from  a  Shrink's  point  of  view  --  that  a  lot  of  his  life  was  programmed  
He  had  the  expectations  of  his  Senatorial  father  and  washington  dc  
Most  of  us  work  with  groups. And  i  put  this  up  because  the  Dschool  the  design  school  at  stanford. Thanks  to  david  kelley  and  a  lot  of  others  who  have  been  visionary  about  its  establishment  has  allowed  a  group  of  us  to  get  together  and  create  a  course  called  from  play  to  innovation.
So  what  will  follow  is  a  Student-made  film  about  just  that  
But  it  Doesn't  have  to  be  that  way.
Thank  you  
If  you  stop  a  cat  from  playing  --  which  you  can  do  and  We've  all  seen  how  cats  bat  around  stuff  --  They're, just  as  good  predators, as  they  would  be  if  they  Hadn't  played  
And  if  you  look  at  sleep  and  dreams  biologically  animals, sleep  and  dream  and  they  rehearse  and  they  do  some  other  things  that  help  memory, and  that  are  a  very  important  part  of  sleep  and  dreams  
The  next  step  of  evolution  in  mammals  and  creatures  with  Divinely  Superfluous  neurons  will  be  to  play  
Well, i  think  the  only  way  i  know  to  do.
Unfortunately  that  Hasn't  been  done  sufficiently  for  the  national  science  foundation, national  institute  of  mental  health, or  anybody  else  to  really  look  at  it  in  this  way.
So  our  Diners  started  to  get  bored  with  this  idea, and  we  decided  to  give  them  the  same  course  twice. So  here  we  actually  took  an  element  from  the  maki  roll  and  and  took  a  picture  of  a  dish. And  then  basically  served  that  picture  with  the  dish.
It's  a  Glycoprotein  called  Miraculin, a  naturally  occurring  thing. It  still  freaks  me  out  every  time. I   eat  it, but  it  has  a  unique  ability  to  mask  certain  taste  receptors  on  your  tongue. So  that  primarily  sour, taste  receptors.
As  long  as  It's  good  for  you  and  good  for  the  environment, it  Doesn't  matter  
Aside  from  One-person  abc  Mini-bureaus  in  nairobi, new  delhi  and  mumbai. There  are  no  network  news  Bureaus  in  all  of  africa, india  or  south  america  --  places  that  are  home  to  more  than  two  billion  people.
And  can  we  afford  not  to  thank  you  
At  this  time, there  were  thousands  of  individuals, we  think  that  were  infected  with  hiv  
Ok, now, more  importantly, had  we  been  there  in  the  '40s  and  '50s  '60s  had  we  seen  this  disease  had  we  understood  exactly  what  was  going  on  with  it. How  might  that  have  changed  and  completely  transformed  the  nature  of  the  way?
Nevertheless, we  spend  the  vast  majority  of  our  energy  focused  on  this  level  of  the  pyramid, trying  to  tackle  things  that  are  already  completely  adapted  to  human  beings  that  are  going  to  be  very, very  difficult  to  address  --  as  We've  seen  in  the  case  of  hiv  
So  during  the  last  15  years, I've  been  working  to  actually  study  the  earlier  interface  here  --  what  I've  labeled  viral  chatter, which  was  a  term  coined  by  my  mentor  don  burke  
Narrator: deep  in  a  remote  region  of  cameroon, two  hunters  stalk  their  prey  
A  group  of  hunters  approach  their  packs  loaded  with  wild  game  
This  is  challenging  work  to  do  
But  --  when  he  began  to  speak, they  would  actually  recognize  his  voice  from  the  radio  
So  what  happened?
We  made  a  number  of  discoveries.
It's  something  we  should  be  following  It's, not  something  that  we  should  be  surprised  by  
So  It's, not  just  hunters  in  central  africa.
And  somehow  the  idea  that  one  would  want  to  make  art  for  the  iphone, which  my  friends, and  i  are  doing  now  is  still  not  reflected  in  our  understanding  of  what  computers  are  for  
If  you  look  carefully, you  can  even  see  a  hint  of  the  apple  menu  up  here  in  the  upper  left  where  the  virtual  world  has  literally  punched  through  to  the  physical  
Because  this  is  in  some  sense, the  first  way  that  people  discover  their  own  potential  as  actors  and  discover  their  own  agency, 
By  saying, who  is  that  person  in  the  mirror?
Song  is  one  of  our  oldest  ways  of  making  ourselves  heard  and  understood  
And  so  whereas  dr  oliver  sacks  has  talked  about  how  perhaps  one  person  in  a  million  actually  has  true  synesthesia, where  they  hear  colors  or  taste  shapes  and  things  like  this  Phonaesthesia  is  something  we  can  all  experience  to  some  extent.
So  the  idea  is  you  step  into  a  kind  of  a  magic  light  
You  know, they  Don't.
And  It's  one  of  the  most  interesting  technical  challenges, That's  very  currently  active  in  the  computer  sciences, being  able  to  have  a  camera  that  can  understand  from  a  fairly  big  distance  away.
And  so  I've  been  beginning  with  a  variety  of  different  projects  to  understand  how  people  can  relate  to  machines  with  their  eyes.
In  the  first  one  which  I'm  going  to  show  you  called  Eyecode  It's, a  piece  of  interactive  software  in  which, if  we  read  this  little  circle, the  trace  left  by  the  looking  of  the  previous  observer, looks  at  the  trace  left  by  the  looking  of  previous  observer.
But  if  i  come  up  really  close  and  stare  directly  at  the  camera  on  this  laptop, then  You'll  see  these  nice  crisp  eyes, 
And  what  You're  typing  are  recordings  of  your  eyes  as  You're  looking  at  other  Peoples'  eyes, 
And  this  exists  in  larger  installations  where  there  are  thousands  and  thousands  of  eyes  that  people  could  be  staring  at  as  you  see  Who's  looking  at  the  people, looking  at  the  people, looking  before  them.
Checking  him  out  
You  say, what  You're  doing  in  140  characters  or  less  and  people  who  are  interested  in  you  get  those  updates  
It  is  by  sharing  these  moments  as  They're  happening  that  lets  people  feel  more  connected  and  in  touch  despite  distance, and  in  real  time, 
One  of  my  favorites  is  what  happened  a  few  months  ago  when  there  was  a  gas  shortage  in  atlanta, 
It's  happened  more  and  more  lately, whether  It's  raising  money  for  homeless  people  or  to  dig  wells  in  africa, or  for  a  family  in  crisis.
Evan  williams  nice, thanks  
And  i  would  like  to  tell  you  a  few  personal  stories  about  what  i  like  to  call  the  danger  of  the  single  story.
My  characters  also  drank  a  lot  of  ginger  beer  because  the  characters  in  the  british  books, i  read  drank  ginger  beer.
I  realized  that  people  like  me  girls  with  skin, the  color  of  chocolate  whose  Kinky  hair  could  not  form  Ponytails  could  also  exist  in  literature.
But  the  unintended  consequence  was  that  i  did  not  know  that  people  like  me  could  exist  in  literature.
So  what  the  discovery  of  african  writers  did  for  me, was  this.
So  i  felt  enormous  pity  for  Fide's  family, 
If  i  had  not  grown  up  in  nigeria, and  if  all  i  knew  about  africa  were  from  popular  images, i  too  would  think  that  africa  was  a  place  of  beautiful  landscapes, beautiful  animals  and  incomprehensible, people  fighting  Senseless  wars, dying  of  poverty  and  aids, unable  to  speak  for  themselves  and  waiting  to  be  saved  by  a  kind  white  foreigner, 
Now, I've  laughed  every  time  I've  read  this  
So  that  is  how  to  create  a  single  story  show  a  people  as  one  thing  as  only  one  thing  over  and  over  again. And  that  is  what  they  become  .
My  cousin  Polle  died  because  he  could  not  get  adequate  healthcare.
What  the  nigerian  writer  Chinua  Achebe  calls  a  balance  of  stories.
What  if  my  roommate  knew  about  my  nigerian  publisher, Mukta, Bakaray, a  remarkable  man  who  left  his  job  in  a  bank  to  follow  his  dream  and  start  a  publishing  house  
He  Disagreed, he  felt  that  people  who  could  read  would  read  if  you  made  literature, affordable  and  available  to  them  
What  if  my  roommate  knew  about  the  female  lawyer, who  recently  went  to  court  in  nigeria  to  challenge  a  ridiculous  law  that  required  women  to  get  their  Husband's  consent  before  renewing  their  passports  
Stories  matter.
We  face  momentous  decisions  with  important  consequences  throughout  our  lives, and  we  have  strategies  for  dealing  with  these  decisions.
We've  surrendered  our  power  trading  off  our  discomfort  with  uncertainty  for  the  illusion  of  certainty  that  they  provide  
It  literally, Flat-lined  
But  what  my  research  has  shown  me  is  that  experts  tend  on  the  whole  to  form  very  rigid  camps  that  within  these  camps, a  dominant  perspective, emerges  that  often  Silences  opposition  that  experts  move  with  the  prevailing  winds, often  Hero-worshipping  their  own  gurus.
A  recent  study  in  the  archives  of  surgery, reported  surgeons  removing  healthy  ovaries  operating  on  the  wrong  side  of  the  brain  carrying  out  procedures  on  the  wrong  hand, elbow  eye  foot  and  also  mistakes  born  out  of  thinking  errors  
Why  was  it  that  when  i  had  an  operation, my  doctor  said  to  me, Beware  ms, hertz  of  Hyperpyrexia, when  he  could  have  just  as  easily  said, watch  out  for  a  high  fever, 
You  see  being  ready  to  take  experts  on  is  about  also  being  willing  to  dig  behind  their  graphs, their  equations, their  Forecasts, their  prophecies  and  being  armed  with  the  questions  to  do  that  --  questions  like, what  are  the  assumptions  that  Underpin  this  
If  we  are  to  shift  paradigms, if  we  are  to  make  breakthroughs, if  we  are  to  destroy  myths, we  need  to  create  an  environment  in  which  expert  ideas  are  battling  it  out  in  which  We're, bringing  in  new  diverse, Discordant, heretical  views  into  the  discussion  Fearlessly  in  the  knowledge  that  progress  comes  about, not  only  from  the  creation  of  ideas, but  also  from  their  destruction  --  and  also  from  the  knowledge  that  by  surrounding  ourselves  by  divergent  Discordant, heretical  views  
Google  ceo, eric  Schmidt  is  a  practical  Practitioner  of  this  philosophy.
But  just  imagine  if  we  were  to  junk  this  notion  of  expertise  as  some  sort  of  elite  Cadre  and  instead  embrace, the  notion  of  democratized  expertise  --  whereby  expertise  was  not  just  the  preserve  of  surgeons  and  Ceo's. But  also  Shop-girls  --  yeah, .
Thank  you  
And  so  the  thought  that  i  started  with  was, how  do  you  do  this?
First  component  is  you  charge  the  car  whenever  you  stop  --  ends  up  that  cars  are  these  strange  beasts  that  drive  for  about  two  hours  and  park  for  about  22  hours  
Now  that  last  mile  last  foot, in  a  sense, is  the  first  step  of  the  infrastructure  
What  we  found  out  when  you  move  from  molecules  to  electrons, something  interesting  happens: 
We  have  a  battery  bay, it  costs  the  same  hundred  dollars  as  the  gas  tank.
Those  of  you  who  have  a  hard  time  calculating  what  that  means  --  in  the  average  consumer  environment  We're  in  in  the  us, 
That's  a  new  economic  factor, which  is  fascinating  to  most  people  
So  we  went  out  and  we  looked  at  all  the  car  companies  
And  i  had  to  quit  and  come  and  do  this  thing  called  a  better  place.
We  decided  to  come  into  the  us  
The  foundation  of  this  curve  is  that  we  keep  losing  the  wells  that  are  close  to  the  ground  
By  2015, we  would  have  had  at  least  250  million  new  cars, even  at  the  pace  We're  going  at  right  now.
And  then  we  do  the  opec  stimulus  package  also  known  as  200  dollars  a  barrel  
And  That's  the  difference  between  problems  that  are  additive  like  co2, which  we  go  slowly  up, and  then  we  tip  and  problems  that  are  Depletive  in  which  we  lose  what  we  have  which  Oscillate  and  they  Oscillate  until  we  lose  everything.
You  have  to  remember  that  the  world  today  is  bringing  in  so  many  cars  
You're  looking  at  a  world  where  cars  are  matched  with  windmills  
That's: one  percent  a  year  
And  when  we  go  to  Cop15  at  the  end  of  this  year, we  Can't  stop  thinking  of  padding  co2  
We  have  to  start  thinking  about  giving  Kickers  to  countries  that  are  willing  to  go  to  this  kind  of  scale.
And  there  will  be  about  a  20  percent  chance.
We  have  to  make  it  immediately.
And  we  need  to  do  it  not  within  20  years  or  50  years, but  within  this  presidential  term, because  if  we  Don't, we  will  lose  our  economy  right  after  We'd  lost  our  morality  
They  see  us  as  rocking  the  boat, and  you  can  understand  why  
Now, it  may  sound  as  though  I'm  about  to  preach  atheism, and  i  want  to  reassure  you  that  That's, not  what  I'm  going  to  do.
Essentially  it  does  it  by  providing  a  smooth, ramp  of  gradual, step-by-step  increment  
It  turns  out  to  be  in  principle, incapable  of  doing  the  job  required  of  it  
So  We're  used  to  not  challenging  religious  ideas  and  It's  very  interesting, how  much  of  a  Furor  richard  creates  when  he  does  it?
It  teaches  them  to  accept  authority  revelation  and  faith.
But  suppose  --  --  in  1987, a  reporter  asked  george  bush, Sr  ,
Whether  he  recognized  the  equal  citizenship  and  patriotism  of  americans  who  are  atheists  
She  clearly  feels  in  a  Beleaguered  minority, but  actually  how  do  american  atheists  stack  up  numerically  
The  survey  that  i  quoted, which  is  the  Aris  survey, Didn't  break  down  its  data  by  socio-economic  class, or  education  iq  or  anything  else.
But  let  me  know  show  you  some  data  that  have  been  properly  published  and  analyzed  on  one  special  group.
In  1998  Larson  and  Witham  Polled, the  cream  of  american  scientists, those  Who'd  been  honored  by  election  to  the  national  academy  of  sciences.
Similar  figures  obtained  for  belief  in  personal  immortality, 
I've, not  seen  corresponding  figures  for  elite  scholars  in  other  fields, such  history  or  philosophy, but  I'd  be  surprised  if  they  were  different  
And  I've  already  Hinted  what  that  something  is  
From  what  I've  seen  of  ted? I   think  this  may  be  the  ideal  place  to  launch  it.
Again, i  fear, it  will  cost  money.
I  suspect  that  the  word  atheist  itself  contains  or  remains  a  stumbling  block, far  out  of  proportion  to  what  it  actually  means  and  a  stumbling  block  to  people  who  otherwise  might  be  happy  to  out  themselves.
Hence, the  phrase  tooth  fairy  agnostic  
The  onus  is  not  on  the  rest  of  us  to  say, why  not  
But  we  Don't  bother  to  say, so, and  this  is  why  my  friend  uses  tooth  fairy  agnostic  as  a  label  for  what  most  people  would  call  atheist.
When  atheists  like  stephen  hawking  and  albert  einstein  use  the  word, god, they  use  it.
What  i  want  to  do  this  morning  is  share  with  you  a  couple  of  stories  and  talk  about  a  different  africa.
Already  this  morning, there  were  some  Allusions  to  the  africa  that  you  hear  about  all  the  time, the  africa  of  hiv/aids, the  africa  of  malaria, the  africa  of  poverty, the  africa  of  conflict  and  the  africa  of  disasters  
This  is  a  story  about  the  fact  that  people  want  their  resources  managed  properly  for  their  good  and  not  taken  out  to  places  where  They'll  benefit  just  a  few  of  the  elite  
Because  if  we  can  get  the  20  billion  dollars  sitting  out  there  back, it  may  be  far  more  for  some  of  these  countries  than  all  the  aid  that  is  being  put  together.
One  in  four, sub-saharan  africans  is  nigerian, and  it  has  140  million  dynamic  people  --  chaotic  people  --  but  very  interesting  people  You'll  never  be  bored.
Not  the  international  monetary  fund, not  the  world  bank, where  i  worked  for  21  years  and  rose  to  be  a  vice  president  
You  Couldn't  get  it.
The  smartest  one  first  to  come  in  was  the  Mtn  company  of  south  africa, 
Nigerians  themselves  began  to  develop  some  wireless  telecommunications  companies  and  three  or  four  others  have  come  in  
And  we  had  gdp  grow  from  an  average  of  23  percent, the  previous  decade  to  about  65  percent.
We  consolidated  them  from  89  to  25  banks  by  requiring  that  they  increase  their  capital  --  share  capital  
In  tourism, in  many  african  countries, a  great  opportunity  
But  you  should  know  that  this  continent  is  not  --  is  a  continent  of  many  countries, not  one  country  
But  imagine  the  impact  on  a  family  if  the  parents  can  be  employed  and  make  sure  that  their  children  go  to  school, that  they  can  buy  the  drugs  to  fight  the  disease  themselves.
If  we  can  invest  in  places  where  you  yourselves  make  money  whilst  creating  jobs  and  helping  people  stand  on  their  own  feet, Isn't  that  a  wonderful  opportunity  Isn't  that  the  way  to  go  
Mixing  african  materials, such  as  we  have  with  materials  from  elsewhere.
And  so  to  start  helping  that  i  want  to  take  us  back  to  1835  
Four  and  a  half  million  users  around  the  world, contributing  their  Leftover  computer  cycles  whenever  their  computer  Isn't  working  by  running  a  screen  Saver  and  together, sharing  their  resources  to  create  a  massive  supercomputer  that  nasa  harnesses  to  analyze  the  data  coming  from  radio, telescopes, 
What  this  picture  suggests  to  us  is  that  We've  got  a  radical  change  in  the  way, information  production  and  exchange  is  Capitalized, not  that  It's  become  less  capital  intensive  --  that  There's  less  money, That's  required  --  but  that  the  ownership  of  this  capital, the  way  the  Capitalization  happens  is  radically  distributed.
It  used  to  be  wireless  was  one  person  owned  the  license  they  transmitted  in  an  area. And  it  had  to  be  decided  whether  they  would  be  licensed  or  based  on  property.
It  was  too  expensive  to  have  decentralized  social  production  to  have  decentralized  action  in  society  that  was  not  about  society  itself.
It's  that  It's  the  first  time  that  It's  having  major  economic  impact, 
You  have  to  hire  them  to  spend  a  lot  of  time.
It's  creating  and  It's  most  visible.
Peer-to-peer  networks: Assaulting, the  recording  industry, free  and  open  source  software, taking  market  share  from  microsoft  skype, potentially  threatening  traditional  telecoms, wikipedia  competing  with  online  encyclopedias.
And  you  see  surfers  people  who  see  this  happening, and  in  some  sense, build  it  into  a  supply  chain, which  is  a  very  curious  one  right  
In  1918, a  new  virus, appeared  that  killed  some  50  to  100  million  people  
It  spread  like  Wildfire  and  some  died  within  hours  of  developing  symptoms  
When  they  work, they  can  make  history.
Or  polio, how  many  of  you  remember  the  iron  lung  
So  Let's, explore  how  vaccines  work  
When  You're  Pre-immunized, what  happens  is  you  have  forces  in  your  body  Pre-trained  to  recognize  and  defeat  specific  Foes  
Seth  berkley, really  cool  video: Isn't.
In  addition  wild  aquatic  birds, carry  all  known  strains  of  influenza  
Now, luckily, that  particular  virus, although  very  scary  at  the  time, did  not  transmit  from  person  to  person  very  easily  
We've  got  these  new  antibodies, We've  identified. And  we  know  that  they  latch  onto  many  many  variations  of  the  virus.
But  you  know  the  research  that  has  occurred  from  hiv  now  has  really  helped  with  innovation  with  other  diseases.
So  far  animal  tests  indicate  that  such  a  vaccine  could  prevent  severe  disease, although  you  might  get  a  mild  case.
It  was  a  slow  cumbersome  process  that  depended  on  chicken  eggs, millions  of  living  chicken  eggs, 
Now, think  of  where  this  leads  us  
New  infectious  diseases  appear  or  reappear  every  few  years.
Will  we  be  quick  enough  to  react  before  millions  die, 
You  also  can  use  Adjuvants, which  are  chemicals.
I  call  them  the  cheetah  generation.
The  cheetah  generation  is  a  new  breed  of  africans  who  brook  no  nonsense  about  corruption.
Now, We're  talking  about  a  continent  that  is  not  poor  
There  are  people  who  think  that  we  should  pour  more  money, more  aid  into  this  bowl, which  leaks  
Let's, take  food  imports  
Just  add  that  up  all  these  Leakages  
Kwame, Nkrumah, Nyerere, Kenyatta  --  somebody  mentioned  Idi, Amin, 
By  creating  wealth, 
And  you  Can't  develop  the  informal  and  the  traditional  sectors, without  an  operational  understanding  of  how  these  two  sectors  work  
Without  the  council, the  chief  Can't  pass  any  law  and  if  the  chief  Doesn't  govern, according  to  the  will  of  the  people, he  will  be  removed.
So  It's  quite  appropriate  that  this  section  is  called  a  marketplace  
What  africans  practiced  was  a  different  form  of  capitalism, but  then  after  independence, all  of  a  sudden  markets, capitalism  became  a  western  institution. And  the  leaders  said, africans  were  ready  for  socialism.
A  bigger  boat  will  mean  more  fish  will  be  caught  and  landed  
They're  people  getting  out  of  poverty  as  fast  as  they  can  
And  the  journalist  was  asking  him, why  is  this  so  important  
They  disappeared, 
But  a  couple  of  weeks  ago, i  asked  a  bunch  of  friends  to  google  egypt  and  to  send  me  screen  shots  of  what  they  got  
And  the  thing  is  that  the  algorithms  Don't  yet  have  the  kind  of  embedded  ethics  that  the  editors  did  
Now, i  have  to  take  off  my  shoes  or  boots  to  get  on  an  airplane  
We  went  in  and  sat  down  at  the  booth, and  the  Waitress  came  over  made  a  big  Commotion  over  tipper  
She  said, yes, That's, former  vice  president  al  gore  and  his  wife  tipper  
It's  like  Beachcombing, you  know, every  time  the  tide  comes  in  and  out  you  find  some  more  shells.
It's  an  easy, visible  target  of  concern, and  it  should  be.
Insulation  better  design, buy  green  electricity, where  you  can  
A  lot  of  us  in  here  have  made  that  decision. And  it  is  really  pretty  easy.
It  Doesn't  mean  that  if  you  are  a  republican  that  I'm  trying  to  convince  you  to  be  a  democrat, we  need  republicans  as  well. This  used  to  be  a  Bipartisan  issue.
We  have  to  buy  a  lot  of  those  ads  
Again, the  republicans  here, this  Shouldn't  be  Partisan, 
And  all  the  burning  of  oil  and  coal  and  gas  all  the  fossil  fuels  have  changed  the  atmosphere, greatly  
And  one  of  the  really  most  incredible  things, i  think, is  that  There's  nobody  out  there  trying  to  collect  it  at  the  site  where  it  is  densest  
You  see  people  who  are  really  Shell-shocked  
So  this  is  the  gulf  of  mexico, Sparkling  place, full  of  fish, 
You  can  see  where  the  oil  is  concentrated  at  the  surface, and  then  it  is  attacked  because  they  Don't  want  the  evidence  in  my  opinion.
We  heard  that  bacteria  eat  oil  
So  do  sea  turtles  
When  it  breaks  up, it  has  a  long  way  to  go  before  it  gets  down  to  bacteria  
I  heard  the  most  incredible  story  today, when  i  was  on  the  train  coming  here, 
That's, the  story  of  thousands  of  people  
The  other  thing  about  the  gulf  that  is  important  is  that  there  are  a  lot  of  animals  that  concentrate  in  the  gulf  at  certain  parts  of  the  year  
If  It's  not  It's, certainly  affecting  their  eggs  and  larvae, i  would  certainly  think  
So  while  the  oil  spill  the  leak, the  eruption  is  a  catastrophe, i  think  It's  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  We've  done  a  lot  to  affect  What's  in  the  ocean  for  a  very, very  long  time.
We're, starting  with  something  That's  had  a  lot  of  stresses  and  a  lot  of  problems  to  begin  with  
It's  just  ridiculous  
I  think  that  this  is  the  result  of  gross  Negligence  
The  first  offshore  drills  were  called  Harpoons  
Your  sequence  and  mine  are  slightly  different  
I've  got  brown  eyes, you  might  have  blue  or  gray  
I  think  we  should  say  it  all  together, 
And  still  you  may  not  see  the  branches  
But  seriously  What's  wrong  with  this  
You  already  know  enough  to  tell  me  --  What's  wrong  with  this  statement.
And  so  Let's  do  a  series  of  comparisons  to  show  you  
I  assure  you, this  is  very  tiny  It's  just  six  microns  on  a  side.
And  That's  just  a  mouse  brain  --  It's  a  lot  smaller  than  a  human  brain.
I  feel  curiosity, and  i  feel  wonder, but  at  times  i  have  also  felt  despair  
Why  did  i  choose  to  study  this  organ  that  is  so  awesome  in  its  complexity  that  it  might  well  be  infinite  
And  There's  a  lot  of  evidence  that  neural  activity  is  Encoding  our  thoughts, feelings  and  perceptions, our  mental  experiences.
And  if  you  put  those  two  facts  together, it  means  that  your  experiences  can  change  your  connectome.
And  it  might  true  that  just  the  mere  act  of  thinking  can  change  your  connectome  --  an  idea  that  you  may  find  empowering  
And  so  we  might  even  speak  of  the  stream  of  consciousness.
I'll  give  you  a  hint, It's, a  big  number  ,
Zach  Kaplan  keith  and  i  lead  a  research  team  
Because  the  way  that  he  presented  the  concept  --  his  approach  was  totally  different  than  ours, he  sold  it  to  you  as  if  it  was  for  sale. Right  now.
Inventables, water  adventures, Dares  you  to  launch  yourself  on  a  Magnetically-levitating  board  down  a  Waterslide  so  fast  so  tall  that  when  you  hit  the  bottom, it  uses  brakes  to  stop  
In  addition, you  can  see  from  the  diagram  on  the  right.
So  I'm  sure, all  you  engineers  know  that  even  though  aluminum  is  a  metal  It's, not  a  magnetic  material, but  something  unexpected  happens  when  you  drop  a  magnet  down, an  aluminum  tube  
It's  perfectly  clear, It's, Odorless, It's, Colorless, 
Shape-retaining  is  common  in  metal. You  bend  a  piece  of  aluminum  Foil, and  it  holds  its  place.
So  my  favorite  idea  for  this  is  to  apply  the  ink  to  a  book  
For  our  last  technology, we  worked  again  with  roman  and  his  team  at  the  directors  bureau  to  develop  a  commercial  from  the  future  to  explain  how  it  works.
And  these  dyes  change  color  in  response  to  Odors  
By  detecting  the  odor  of  particular  bacteria  or  viruses  or  even  lung  cancer, the  dots  will  change, and  they  can  use  software  to  analyze  the  results.
Because  every  one  of  these  six  changed  our  understanding  of  what  was  possible  in  the  world  prior  to  seeing  this, we  would  have  assumed  a  10-foot  pole  Couldn't  fit  in  your  pocket.
Thank  you  
I  mean, It's  Crucified, 
Spanish: chef: accused  of  cheating, 
A  huge  scandal  for  a  few  weeks.
That  is  until  i  went  to  Eduardo's  farm  in  Extremadura  50  miles  north  of  Seville, right  on  the  portugal  border  
I'm  just  here  to  give  the  geese  what  they  want  
I  was  speaking  too  loudly  
Right  up  to  us  like  right  up  to  here.
He  Doesn't  
So  he  got  rid  of  the  electricity, he  got  rid  of  current  on  the  inside  and  kept  it  on  the  outside.
Part  of  the  income  for  his  farm.
A  big  part  of  his  income  for  his  farm.
That's, how  I've  been  trained  
So  I'm  listening  to  all  this, you  know, and  I'm, like, is  this  guy  for  real  is  he  making  some  of  this  up  
Is  he  like, you  know  --  because  he  seemed  to  have  an  answer  for  everything, and  it  was  always  nature.
Because  really  they  want  you  to  look  at  themselves, right?
And  We're  sitting  there, and  i  hear  [clapping]  from  a  distance.
To  fly  south  in  the  winter  and  north  when  it  gets  warm  
And  the  problem  with  saying  that, of  course, is  that  you  know, at  this  point, it  risks  hyperbole  really  easily  
I'm, really  in  love  with  him  at  this  point, 
He  takes  the  liver  when  he  Harvests  the  foie  gras, he  sticks  them  in  this  jar, and  he  Confits  it  
No  salt, no  pepper, no  oil, no  spices, 
We  went  back  out  for  the  final  tour  of  the  farm, and  he  showed  me  the  wild  pepper  plants  and  the  plants  that  he  made  sure  existed  on  his  farm  for  Salinity  
How  come  you  Don't  give  him  this  
I  really  was  moved  
The  pharaoh  got  wind  of  this  and  wanted  to  taste  it  
And  the  jews  Fearing  for  their  life  had  to  come  up  with  an  ingenious  idea, or  at  least  try  and  satisfy  the  Pharaoh's  wishes.
One  in  which  we  stop  treating  the  planet  as  if  it  were  some  kind  of  business  in  Liquidation  
Whether  We're  talking  about  Brussels  Sprouts  or  foie  gras  
That  is  our  poetry  that  is  our  beautiful  story.
Ok, i  can  see  if  i  found  something  up  up, and  they  continue  up  up  up.
You  you  survive  It's, ok?
Nobody's  obliged  to  be  a  genius  
It's  better, but  nobody  
This  line  of  evolution  is  clearly  positive  
But  if  you  take  a  lens  like  that, this  line  is  Ack  Ack, Ack, Ack  Ack, like  that  
There  is  different  type  of  barbaria.
That's, why  today  I'm  so  ashamed  to  make  this  job  
But  i  know  that  even  i  do  it  the  best  possible  --  That's: why  I'm  the  best  --  It's, nothing  
And  because  we  must  all  work  to  finish  this  story, 
This  scenario  of  this  civilization  was  about  becoming  powerful  intelligent  like  this  idea. We  have  invented  this  concept  of  god.
You  go  to  the  future  back  back  back  back  like  that  
He  would  also  supply  me  with  tools  
It  was  this  great  magic  store? It  was  a  crappy  little  building  in  midtown, but  You'd  be  in  the  elevator. The  elevator  would  open  --  There'd  be  this  little  small  magic  store  You'd  be  in  the  magic  store.
And  so  i  started  thinking  about  lost  and  the  stuff  that  we  do, and  i  realized, oh  my  god, mystery  boxes  are  everywhere  in  what  i  do  
Jack, get  him  out  of  here, get  him  away  from  the  engine. Get  him  out  of  here.
Man, hey, hey, hey, get  away  from  --  Jja.
And  i  often  am  like, you  know, dude  today, I'm  out, i  got  nothing, you  know, 
So  There's  that, in  terms  of  the  content  of  it, you  look  at  stories, you  think, well, what  are  stories?
Then  There's  the  thing  of  mystery  in  terms  of  imagination  --  the  Withholding  of  information, you  know, doing  that  intentionally  is  much  more  engaging  
Die, hard  right  crazy.
There  are  great  scenes  --  maybe  not  the  most  amazing  dramatic  scenes  in  the  history  of  time.
Father  'cause  i  need  it  
Come  on. So  you  think  of  jaws  --  so  That's  the  kind  of  stuff  that  like, you  know, the  investment  of  character, which  is  the  stuff  that  really  is  inside  the  box.
It's  why  when  people  do  Sequels  or  rip  off  movies, you  know  of  a  genre  They're  ripping  off  the  wrong  thing.
You  Gotta, rip  off  --  you  know, if  you  rip  something  off  --  rip  off  the  character, 
Because  ultimately, you  know  the  mystery  box  is  all  of  us.
The  moment  the  lights  go  down  is  often  the  best  part.
And  You're  full  of  that  amazing  --  that  feeling  of  excited, anticipation  
The  stuff  that  i  was  lucky  and  begging  for  to  get  when  i  was  a  kid, is  now  ubiquitous  
When  i  did  mission  impossible  iii: we  had  amazing  visual  effects  stuff.
So  eddie  has  this  gun  --  and  He's  the  greatest  guy  --  He's, this  really  sweet  english  guy, He's  like, sorry. I   Don't  want  to  hurt.
And  i  realized  that  we  had  to  do  something  'cause  it  Wasn't  working, just  as  it  was  ,
And  tom  would  know  just  how  hard  to  push  the  gun. He  Wouldn't  hurt  himself.
And  in  the  egyptian  revolution, the  revolution  20, everyone  has  contributed  something  small  or  big, they  contributed  something  --  to  bring  us  one  of  the  most  inspiring  stories  in  the  history  of  mankind.
It  was  actually  really  inspiring  to  see  all  these  egyptians  completely  changing  
But  the  reason  why  everyone  was  silent  is  what  i  call  the  psychological  barrier  of  fear  
And  that  psychological  barrier  of  fear  had  worked  for  so  many  years.
Platforms  like  youtube, twitter, facebook  were  helping  us  a  lot.
They  probably  have  the  best  life  in  the  world.
And  everyone  started  to  think  that  this  guy  could  be  my  brother  
What  are  we  going  to  do?
In  a  few  days, tens  of  thousands  of  people  there  --  angry, egyptians  who  were  asking  the  ministry  of  interior  affairs  enough, 
But  of  course, they  Don't  listen  
In  fact, one  of  the  most  ridiculous  ideas  was, hey, Let's, have  a  silent, stand  
There  was  no  leader  
And  I'm  not  going  to  talk  about  my  experience, because  this  is  not  about  me.
The  next  day  i  was  in  tahrir  
When  i  saw  that, i  went  back  and  i  wrote  on  facebook  
But  today, I'm  going  to  talk  to  you  about  something  you  Can't  see  --  What's  going  on  up  in  that  little  brain  of  hers, 
And  Therein  lies  a  critical  puzzle.
Well, It's  got  to  do  with  your  brain  
But  we  as  adults  are  no  longer  absorbing  those  statistics  
It  takes  a  human  being  for  babies  to  take  their  statistics  
So  this  is  little  emma  
Just  as  the  poets  and  writers  described  We're  going  to  be  able  to  see, i  think  that  wondrous  openness  utter  and  complete  openness  of  the  mind  of  a  child  
Thank  you  
And  early  in  the  morning, i  went  into  the  ward, 
I  watched  her  hands  as  she  bathed  an  old  man, 
And  we  run  clinics  in  these  very  remote  regions  where  There's  no  medical  care  whatsoever, 
And  he  walked  in  and  somebody  said  something  to  him, we  realized  he  was  deaf, and  we  looked  into  the  rags. And  there  was  this  pair  of  eyes.
The  rags  were  Unwrapped  from  a  little  girl  whose  body  was  massively  burned  
It  was  the  young  women, the  health  aids, who  cleaned  the  wounds  of  this  baby  and  dressed  the  wounds.
And  my  family  brought  in  a  woman  whose  mother  had  been  a  slave  to  take  care  of  me, 
And  that  woman  did  not  have  sentimental  compassion, 
I  had  that  condition  to  a  certain  extent  from  my  own  childhood  illness, 
And  in  that  paralysis, of  course, our  capacity  for  compassion  is  also  paralyzed  
The  very  word  terror  is  global  
So  our  work  in  a  certain  way  is  to  address  this  Imago, this  kind  of  archetype  that  has  Pervaded  the  psyche  of  our  entire  globe.
Hey, we  live  in  a  very  Noxious  world.
Why  Don't  we  train  our  children  in  compassion?
Women  have  Manifested  for  thousands  of  years, the  strength  arising  from  compassion  in  an  unfiltered  Unmediated  way  in  perceiving  suffering, as  it  is  
And  they  have  Actualized  compassion  through  direct  action.

I  was  one  of  the  founding  members  of  the  axis  of  evil  comedy  tour  
Then  there  was  aron  Kader, who  was  the  Palestinian-american  
And  i  opened  it  up, it  said, born  in  iran  I'm  like, oh, come  on  man, 
Ah, ha, american  great  
His  name  was  jabbar: 
He  says, you  wait  I'll, be  back.
Like  a  couple  months  ago, in  times  square  in  new  york, there  was  this  pakistani  muslim  guy  who  tried  to  blow  up  a  car  bomb.
And  one  thing  that  happened  there  was  also  the  pakistani  taliban  took  credit  for  that  failed  car  bombing  
We  just  wanted  to  say, we  tried  
Out  of  my  way  out  of  my  way  out  of  my  way, 
You  want  some  frozen  yogurt  
I  have  one  gram, five  gram, 10  gram. How  many  gram  do  you  want?
I  put  my  two  year-old  on  the  slide, he  went  Frrmrmm.
I  went  down, i  go  Where's.
I  go  I'm, sorry, then  why  were  you  staring  at  me?
So  i  would  like  to  show  you  something  I've  been  working  on  
He  had  this  wonderful  trick  where  a  Rosebush  would  bloom  right  in  front  of  your  eyes.
But  it  was  his  production  of  a  butterfly  that  was  the  most  beautiful  
Marco  Tempest  when  asked  about  deception, he  said  this  announcer  magic  is  the  only  honest  profession  
I  use  a  lot  of  tricks, which  means  that  sometimes  i  have  to  lie  to  you

Self-deception  
Which  is  why  in  this  vast  and  lonely  cosmos, we  are  so  wonderfully  optimistic  
Put  a  crab  inside  it  
So  the  guy  Replies, yeah, i  know, i  know, 
I'm  like  a  junior  varsity, Cheerleader, sometimes  --  for  swearing  awkward, Silences  and  very  simple  rhyme  schemes, 
[  i  Don't  need  2, write  it  down  ]  I'm  going  to  show  you  how  terrorism  actually  interacts  with  our  daily  life.
Now, as  many  of  you  may  remember  the  red  brigades  was  a  terrorist  Marxist  organization, which  was  very  active  in  italy  from  the  1960s  until  the  Mid-1980s  
As  part  of  their  strategy, the  red  brigades  never  spoke  with  anybody  not  even  with  their  lawyers  
In  1993, they  declared  the  end  of  the  armed  struggle.
But  this  is  exactly  what  i  did, because  i  wanted  to  know  what  had  turned  my  best  friend  into  a  terrorist. And  why  She'd  never  tried  to  recruit  me.
So  because  i  am  a  trained  economist, and  i  think  in  economic  terms, all  of  the  sudden  i  thought, maybe  there  is  something  here.
And  there  are  three  main  stages.
But  above  all, they  started  to  do  serious  business  with  the  world  of  crime  
Rogue  economics  is  a  force  which  is  constantly  lurking  in  the  background  of  history.
And  it  actually  happened  again  with  the  fall  of  the  berlin  wall  
What  does  it  mean?
This  privilege  is  called  Seigniorage  
No  other  country  can  do  that  
What  the  patriot  act  did  was  to  prohibit  us  bank  and  Us-registered  foreign  banks  from  doing  any  businesses  with  Off-shore  facilities.
It  also  gave  the  us  monetary  authorities, the  right  to  monitor  any  dollar  transaction, taking  place  anywhere  in  the  world.
It  was  introduced  only  in  the  united  states.
In  europe, a  similar  legislation  was  not  introduced  
Cumulatively  i  will  have  rowed  over  8000  miles  taken  over  three  million  Oar  strokes  and  spent  more  than  312  days  alone  on  the  ocean  on  a  23  foot  Rowboat  
Now, some  of  you  might  be  thinking  hold  on  a  minute. She  Doesn't  look  very  much  like  an  ocean.
I  thought  there  were  them, and  there  were  us, and  i  was  not  one  of  them.
And  i  think  i  knew  from  day  one  that  it  Wasn't  the  right  job  for  me, 
I'd  gone  through  some  changes  
And  i  remember  looking  at  these  two  versions  of  my  obituary  and  thinking, oh  boy, I'm  on  totally  the  wrong  track  here, 
It  was  a  bit  like  finishing  a  marathon  and  getting  out  of  solitary  Confinement  and  winning  an  oscar  all  rolled  into  one  
Mostly  a  baseball  cap  rowing  gloves  and  a  smile  --  or  a  frown, depending  on  whether  i  went  backwards  overnight  --  and  lots  of  sun, Lotion  
So  because  nobody  in  their  straight  mind  would  row  straight  past, hawaii  without  dropping  in, i  decided  to  cut  this  very  big  undertaking  into  three  segments.
But  what  do  you  do?
I  had  a  meeting  with  the  president  there  who  told  me  about  his  exit  strategy  for  his  country.
I  even  met  one  of  them, and  she  was  just  about  my  size  
This  is  a  World-wide  community.
I  plan  on  being  around  for  a  long  time.
It's  very  difficult  to  be  healthy  on  a  planet, where  We've  poisoned  the  earth  and  the  sea  and  the  air  
And  the  idea  here  is  that  all  our  Eco-heroes  will  log  at  least  one  green  deed  every  day  
And  if  you  put  creation  and  optimism  together, You've  got  two  choices  that  you  can  talk  about  
This  has  been  a  really  Galvanizing  issue  for  a  long  time.
This  was  a  scheme  by  a  team  called  think, a  new  York-based  team.
We  all  want  to  go  out  and  buy  an  Audi  Tt  Don't.
It's  in  our  nature  to  go  Ricocheting  back  and  forth  between  this  technocratic  solution  and  a  larger, sort  of  more  romantic  image  of  where  we  are  
And  these  are  two  of  the  top  architectural  practices  in  the  united  states  today, 
Yeah, It's. One  of  those  giant  camera  lenses  that  takes  a  picture  of  the  outside  world  --  It's  sort  of  a  little  movie  without  any  moving  parts  --  and  projects  it  on  a  page. And  you  can  see  the  world  outside  you  as  you  walk  around.
They  all  want  to  save  money  by  building  the  same  thing.
Here's  the  little  drawing  that  tells  them  how  that  works  --  and  That's, what  will  happen  in  the  end.
So  Let's  make  architectural  sand  dunes  and  a  beach  Cabana  
So  they  went  out  and  they  modeled  a  computer  model  of  a  sand, dune  
Only  one  of  whom  had  ever  seen  the  plans  before

Right  now  is  the  most  exciting  time  to  see  new  indian  art  
This  next  artist  Ns  Harsha  actually  has  a  studio  right  here  in  mysore  
He's  putting  a  contemporary  spin  on  the  miniature  tradition, 
He  creates  these  fine, delicate  images, which  he  then  repeats  on  a  massive  scale.
This  next  artist  is, probably  the  alpha  male  of  contemporary  indian  art.
But  i  can  only  hope  I've, Whet, your  appetite  to  go  out  and  see  and  learn  more  about  the  amazing  things  that  are  happening  in  art  in  india  today, 
So  I'm  going  to  show  you  some  ways  that  we  can  violate  your  expectations. First  of  all, i  want  to  show  you  the  particular  illusion. Here  i  want  you  first  of  all  when  it  pops  up  on  the  screen  to  notice  that  the  two  holes  are  perpendicular  to  each  other. These  are  all  perceptual  tricks. These  are  real  objects  that  I'm  going  to  show  you  now  I'm  going  to  show  you  how  it  is  done. I've  Looped  the  film  here. So  you  can  get  a  very  interesting  experience. I   want  you  to  see  how  this  illusion  is  constructed  and  It's  going  to  rotate. So  you  see  that  It's  inside  out  now  watch  as  it  rotates  back, how  quickly  your  perception  Snaps?
How  many  of  you  here  see? Dolphins? Raise  your  hand  if  you  see  dolphins. Ok, those  people  who  raised  their  hands  afterwards, the  rest  of  the  audience, go  talk  to  them. All  right.
Now, something  like  this  can  be  used  because  this  is  after  all  talk  about  design  too. This  was  done  by  Saatchi  and  Saatchi, and  they  actually  got  away  with  this  ad  in  australia. So  if  you  look  at  this  ad  for  beer, all  those  people  are  in  sort  of  provocative  positions, but  they  got  it  passed  and  actually  won  the  Clio  awards.
You  can  violate  your  expectations  about  experience. Here  is  an  outside  water  fountain  that  i  created  with  some  friends  of  mine, but  you  can  stop  the  water  in  drops, and  --  actually  make  all  the  drops  Levitate. This  is  something  We're  building  for, you  know, amusement  parks.
Well, There's  analog  and  digital  thought  that  was  appropriate  here.
Now  I'm  going  to  skip  ahead  since  I'm, sort  of  running  [behind]. I   want  to  show  you  quickly  what  I've  created  some  new  type  of  illusions, I've  done  something  with  taking  the  Pixar-type  illusions.
And  It's  interesting  by  doing  this  in  this  sort  of  rendered  fashion, how  much  stronger  the  illusions  are  any  case  i  hope  this  has  brought  you  a  little  joy  and  happiness. And  if  You're  interested  in  seeing  more  cool  effects, see  me  outside  I'd, be  happy  to  show  you  lots  of  things.
So  i  want  to  share  with  you  a  couple  key  insights  about  complexity, We're  learning  from  studying  nature  that  maybe  are  applicable  to  other  problems.
I'm  here  today, as  june  said  to  talk  about  a  project  that  my  twin  sister  and  i  have  been  doing  for  the  past  three  and  half  years  
This  is  our  Invocation  in  crochet  of  a  bleached  reef.
So  we  went  and  taught  the  techniques  we  did  workshops  and  lectures  
The  Frilly  Crenulated  forms  that  you  see  in  corals  and  Kelps  and  Sponges  and  Nudibranchs  is  a  form  of  geometry  known  as  hyperbolic  geometry.
And  the  only  way  that  mathematicians  know  how  to  model  this  structure  is  with  crochet. It  happens  to  be  a  fact.
Before  hyperbolic  geometry, mathematicians  knew  about  two  kinds  of  space, euclidean  space  and  spherical  space.
And  they  have  different  properties.
Think  of  the  surface  of  a  sphere  --  just  like  a  beach  ball, the  surface  of  the  earth, 
And  on  the  surface  of  a  sphere, a  straight  line  is  the  biggest  possible  circle.
To  a  mathematician, if  there  are  two  answers, and  the  first  two  are  zero  and  one  there  is  another  number  that  immediately  suggests  itself  as  the  third  alternative  
This  nearly  drove  mathematicians  bonkers.
I've  Stitched  Euclid's  parallel  postulate  on  to  the  surface, 
Here's, two  creatures  Who've, never  heard  of  Euclid's  parallel  postulate  --  Didn't  know  it  was  impossible  to  violate  and  They're  simply  getting  on  with  it.
I  once  asked  the  mathematicians  why  it  was  that  mathematicians  thought, this  structure  was  impossible  when  sea  slugs  have  been  doing  it  since  the  Silurian  age  
And  That's  true, but  it  also  goes  deeper  than  that.
And  so  too  We've  discovered  that  there  is  an  infinite  taxonomy  of  crochet, hyperbolic  creatures, 
But  we  found  that  when  we  Deviated  from  the  specific  Setness  of  the  mathematical  code  that  underlies  it  --  the  simple  algorithm, crochet, three  increase  one  --  when  we  Deviated  from  that  and  made  embellishments  to  the  code, the  models  immediately  started  to  look  more  natural  
And  kindergarten  was  actually  a  very  formalized  system  of  education  established  by  a  man  named  Friedrich  Froebel, who  was  a  Crystallographer  in  the  19th  century.
He  developed  a  radical  alternative  system  of  engaging  the  smallest  children  with  the  most  abstract  ideas  through  physical  forms  of  play  
Ok, so  how  do  you  study  this  mysterious  organ  
So  let  me  give  you  a  few  striking  examples  of  this  
And  if  you  look  tucked  away  inside  the  inner  surface  of  the  temporal  lobes  --  you  Can't  see  it  there  --  is  a  little  structure  called  the  fusiform  gyrus.
But  There's  another  rare  syndrome  so  rare.
Now, the  most  common  interpretation  of  this, which  you  find  in  all, the  psychiatry  textbooks  is  a  freudian  view. And  that  is  that  this  chap  --  and  the  same  argument  applies  to  women  by  the  way.
Thank  god, or  you  would  all  be  sexually  aroused  when  you  saw  your  mother  
It's  very  ingenious, as  all  freudian  arguments  are  --  --  but  Didn't  make  much  sense  because  i  have  seen  the  same  delusion, a  patient  having  the  same  delusion  about  his  pet  poodle, 
There  are  neurons  there  that  are  sensitive  to  faces.
Now, when  that  Area's  damaged, you  lose  the  ability  to  see  faces  right?
And  then  the  message  cascades  into  the  amygdala, and  then  goes  down  the  Autonomic  nervous  system  
There's, no  delusion  through  the  phone  
And  in  fact, one  student  asked  me  the  other  day. Do  they  get  phantom  Pms?
Now, why  would  a  phantom  limb  be  paralyzed?
How  do  you  Unlearn  the  learned  paralysis? So  you  can  relieve  him  of  this  excruciating  clenching  spasm  of  the  phantom  arm.
He  had  a  Brachial  Avulsion. So  the  nerves  were  cut, and  the  arm  was  paralyzed  lying  in  a  sling  for  a  year.
My  first  patient  came  in  and  he  looked  in  the  mirror, and  i  said, look  at  your  reflection  of  your  phantom  .
He  knows  It's  a  mirror  reflection, but  It's  a  vivid  sensory  experience.
And  he  says, oh, my  god, my  phantom  is  moving  again.
And  then, i  said, close  your  eyes, 
So  i  said, look  derek  --  well, first  of  all, the  guy  Can't  just  go  around  carrying  a  mirror  to  alleviate  his  pain  --  i  said, look  derek  take  it  home  and  practice  with  it  for  a  week  or  two  
I  said, What's  gone  
These  people  Muddle  up  their  senses, 
Why  does  this  happen?
Now, remember  --  why  does  this  happen?
And  that  is, there  is  an  abnormal  gene  a  mutation  in  the  gene  that  causes  this  abnormal  cross  wiring  
So  every  brain  region  is  wired  to  every  other  region, and  these  are  Trimmed  down  to  create  the  characteristic  modular  architecture  of  the  adult  brain.
It's  because  You're  all  doing  a  Cross-model  synesthetic  abstraction, meaning  You're  saying  that  that  sharp  inflection  --  Ki-ki  in  your  auditory  cortex, the  hair  cells  being  excited  --  kiki  mimics  the  visual  inflection  sudden  inflection  of  that  Jagged  shape  
Now, this  is  very  important  because  what  It's  telling  you  is  your  brain  is  engaging  in  a  primitive  --  It's, just  --  it  looks  like  a  silly  illusion. But  these  photons  in  your  eye  are  doing  this  shape  and  hair  cells  in  your  ear, are  exciting  the  auditory  pattern. But  the  brain  is  able  to  extract  the  common  denominator.
Sorry  about  that  
My  talk  will  be  in  two  parts. I'll  talk: first  as  an  astronomer.
So  That's  another  project  for  nasa  
It  landed  on  the  surface.
There's  Scant  chance  of  life  there  --  That's  because  There's  been  no  time  for  the  nuclear  fusion  in  stars  to  make  silicon  and  carbon  and  iron, the  building  blocks  of  planets  and  of  life  
And  until  we  have  that  synthesis, we  Won't  be  able  to  understand  the  very  beginning  of  our  universe.
You  want  to  not  only  synthesize  the  very  large  and  the  very  small, but  we  want  to  understand  the  very  complex  
We  depend  on  stars  to  make  the  atoms  We're  made  of  
We  depend  on  chemistry  to  determine  our  complex  structure  
The  geometric  mean  of  the  mass  of  a  proton  and  the  mass  of  the  sun  is  50  kilograms  within  a  factor  of  two  of  the  mass  of  each  person.
If  i  was  not  a  Self-effacing  brit, i  would  mention  the  book  myself, and  i  would  add  that  It's  available  in  paperback  
First  any  scientific  discovery  has  benign  consequences  as  well  as  dangerous  ones.
He  persuaded  einstein  as  his  last  act  to  sign  the  famous  Memorandum  of  bertrand  russell  
We  need  not  just  campaigning  physicists, but  we  need  biologists  computer  experts  and  environmentalists  as  well  
I  wrote  my  book  our  final  century  as  a  scientist, just  a  general  scientist, but  There's  one  respect, i  think, in  which  being  a  cosmologist  offered  a  special  perspective  and  That's  that  it  offers  an  awareness  of  the  immense  future.
The  Stupendous  time, spans  of  the  evolutionary  past  are  now  part  of  common  culture  --  outside  the  american  bible  belt  anyway  --  but  most  people, even  those  who  are  familiar  with  evolution.
The  unfolding  of  intelligence  and  complexity  still  has  immensely  far  to  go  here  on  earth  and  probably  far  beyond  
But  Let's  suppose  some  aliens  had  been  watching  our  pale  blue  dot  in  the  cosmos  from  afar, not  just  for  40  years, but  for  the  entire  45  billion-year  history  of  our  earth  
Then  other  things  happened  even  more  Abruptly  
Right  now, He's  in  a  forest  in  georgia, 
The  bonobo, although  shorter  than  us  and  their  arms  still  longer  is  more  upright.
Slim-bodied  bonobos  are  by  nature, very  gentle  creatures.
This  is  kanzi, and  i  in  the  forest  
We  need  more  sticks, too  
Good  job  
Video  kanzi  now  makes  his  tools, just  as  our  ancestors  may  have  made  them  two-and-a-half  million  years  ago  --  by  holding  the  rocks  in  both  hands  to  strike  one  against  the  other  
Kanzi's  rock  is  from  Gona  ethiopia  and  is  identical  to  that  used  by  our  african  ancestors.
She's  also  saying, the  name  of  that  with  her  voice  
Panbanisha  began  writing  the  Lexigrams  on  the  forest  floor.
Ss  very  nice, beautiful, panbanisha  
The  curved  line  is  very  similar  to  the  Lexigram  
The  next  symbol  panbanisha  writes  represents  collar.
Researchers  began  to  record  what  panbanisha  said  by  writing  Lexigrams  on  the  floor, with  chalk, 
Then  he  peers  eagerly  into  his  Mother's  mouth.
Narrator: kanzi  plays  the  xylophone  using  both  hands.
Kanzi  and  panbanisha  are  stimulated  by  this  Fun-filled  environment, which  promotes  the  emergence  of  these  cultural  capabilities  
So  we  have  a  Bi-species  environment, we  call  it  a  Panhomoculture  
Here's  a  site, which  allows  you  to  look  at  recovery  spending  in  california

The  light  blue  is  refugee  camps.
So  if  You've  been  involved  in  that  at  all, i  just  wanted  to  say, whatever  You've  been  doing  whether  You've  just  been  chanting, raw  data.
A  man-made  moon, visible  by  ordinary  citizens, it  inspired  awe  and  pride  that  humans  had  finally  launched  an  object  into  space.
Within  a  year, congress  funded  huge  weapons  increases.
Support  for  engineering  math  and  science  --  education  in  general  --  boomed  
And  so  if  You'll  put  up  with  this, i  would  like  to  enlist  your  help  with  a  first  experiment  today, the  experiment  is  --  and  i  notice  by  the  way  that  when  you  Applauded  that  you  did  it  in  a  typical  north  american  way  that  is, you  were  Raucous  and  incoherent, 
So  what  do  we  make  of  that?
Do  you  need  to  be  alive.
And  you  see  that  in  nature, 
Keep  in  mind  that, although  it  looks  as  if  each  individual  is  acting  to  cooperate  What's  really  going  on, is  a  kind  of  selfish  darwinian  behavior  
Each  is  scattering  away  at  random  to  try  to  save  its  scales  or  feathers.
As  i  say, if  You're  in  a  swarm, your  odds  of  being  the  Unlucky, one  are  reduced  as  compared  to  a  small  group.
There  Doesn't  seem  to  be  anything  mystical  about  this  
Specifically  It's, male  fireflies  who  are  all  flashing  in  perfect  time  together  in  perfect  synchrony  to  reinforce  a  message  to  the  females.
Scientific  papers  were  published  saying, it  was  Twitching  eyelids  that  explained  it, or  you  know, a  human  Being's  tendency  to  see  patterns  where  there  are  none  
But  i  hope  You've  convinced  yourself  now  with  this  nighttime  video  that  they  really  were  very  well  synchronized  
Okay, well, the  issue  then  is, do  we  need  to  be  alive  to  see  this  kind  of  spontaneous  order  and  I've  already  Hinted  that  the  answer  is  no  
Now, you  might  think  That's  a  bizarre  idea.
He  would  shoot  his  light  saber  across  the  abyss  making  a  blade  of  light  and  then  Scamper  across  on  this  blade  of  light  
Think  of  the  bridge  as  being  like  this  platform  
Narrator: the  most  dramatic  and  shocking  footage  shows  whole  sections  of  the  crowd  --  hundreds  of  people  --  apparently  rocking  from  side  to  side  in  unison, not  only  with  each  other, but  with  the  bridge  
This  synchronized  movement  seemed  to  be  driving  the  bridge  
But  how  could  the  crowd  become  synchronized  
Allan  mcrobie  is  a  bridge  engineer  from  cambridge, who  wrote  to  me, suggesting  that  a  bridge  simulator  ought  to  wobble  in  the  same  way  as  the  real  bridge  --  provided  we  hung  it  on  Pendulums  of  exactly  the  right  length.
Their  instructions  just  walk  normally  
That  indeed, a  mass  extinction  was  underway  in  our  fields  in  our  agricultural  system.
So  if  i  were  to  going  to  show  you  all  the  beans  in  the  world, and  i  had  a  slide  like  this  and  i  switched  it  every  second, it  would  take  up  my  entire  ted  talk.
And  i  said, you  know  what  these  apples  come  from  your  ancestors  and  your  ancestors  gave  them  the  greatest  honor.
The  bad  news  is  They're, extinct  
The  coldest  growing  seasons  of  the  future  hotter  than  the  hottest  of  the  past  
And  then  there  are  just  daily  disasters  that  take  place  in  these  buildings, financial  problems  and  Mismanagement  and  equipment  failures  and  all  kinds  of  things. And  every  time, something  like  this  happens, it  means  extinction.
Because  quite  literally, if  agriculture  Doesn't  adapt  to  climate  change, neither  will  we

Wi-fi  enables  you  to  avoid  the  processor. And  there  are  some  enhanced  protection  measures, which  i  would  like  to  share  with  you.
I'm  really  troubled  by  that.
Aviation  week, asked  me  to  make  a  list  of  who  i  thought  were  the  Movers  and  Shakers  of  the  first  100  years  of  aviation  
Well, what  happened  when  i  was  a  little  kid  was  --  some  pretty  heavy  stuff, too  
And  this  was  at  a  time  when  mars  was  a  hell  of  a  lot  more  interesting  than  it  is. Now  we  thought  There'd  be  animals  there. We  knew  there  were  plants  there. The  colors  change, right.
These  two  new  airplanes  are  the  same  speed  as  the  Dc8  that  was  done  in  1958  
Here's  the  Biggie, and  that  is, you  Don't  have  innovation  cycles  if  the  government  develops  and  the  government  uses  it  
Computers  were  used  for  artillery.
Keep  that  in  mind, i  put  down  innovation  --  I've  looked  for  innovation  cycles  in  space.
And  i  think  i  want  to  talk  a  little  bit  about  why  we  had  the  courage  to  go  out  and  try  that  as  a  small  company, 
But  i  think  once  it  does, we  will  find  solutions  and  very  quickly, You'll  see  those  resort  hotels  in  orbit.
There's, a  group  of  people  that  have  come  forward  --  and  you  Don't  know  all  of  them  --  but  the  ones  that  have  come  forward  were  inspired  as  young  children, this  little  three-  to  15-year-old  age  by  us  going  to  orbit  and  going  to  the  moon  here, right  in  this  time, period, 
Paul  allen, Elan  Musk, richard  branson.
There  were  a  couple  of  examples  here.
And  I'm  talking  about  if  You've  got  a  baby  now, or  if  You've  got  a  10-year-old  now, 
Relatively  soon  You'll  be  able  to  buy  a  ticket  and  fly  higher  and  faster  than  the  Highest-performance  military  operational  airplane.
You  can  fly  with  russian  hardware. This  is  available, because  a  russian  space  program  is  starving  and  It's  nice  for  them  to  get  20  million  here.
And  every  dollar  that  flows  into  that  will  be  spent  more  efficiently  by  a  factor  of  10  to  15. And  what  that  means  is  before, we  know  it  the  progress  in  human  space  flight  with  no  taxpayer  dollars  will  be  at  a  level  of  about  five  times  as  much  as  the  current  nasa  budgets  for  human  space  flight.
And  this  realization  is  allowing  us  to  Reconceptualize  the  way  that  we  actually  approach  these  diseases  by  controlling  angiogenesis  ,
Now, I'm  going  to  focus  on  cancer.
This  is  a  tumor: dark  gray  ominous  mass  growing  inside  a  brain  
Dr, Judah  Folkman, who  was  my  mentor, and  who  was  the  pioneer  of  the  angiogenesis  field  once  called  this  cancer  without  disease  
And  unfortunately, this  late  stage  of  cancer  is  the  one  at  which  It's  most  likely  to  be  diagnosed  when  angiogenesis  is  already  turned  on.
We  call  this  antiangiogenic  therapy  and  It's  completely  different  from  chemotherapy, because  it  selectively  aims  at  the  blood  vessels  that  are  feeding  the  cancers  
Well, I've  just  shown  you  two, very  different  types  of  cancer  that  both  responded  to  antiangiogenic  therapy, 
And  we  subsequently  treated  more  than  600  dogs  
It  had  already  spread  to  his  lymph  nodes. So  we  used  an  antiangiogenic  skin  cream  for  the  lip  and  an  oral  cocktail.
And  in  fact, the  first  pioneering  treatments  for  people  as  well  as  dogs  are  already  becoming  available  
But  the  real  question  is  how  well  do  these  work  in  practice?
So  Here's  actually  the  patient  survival  data  from  eight  different  types  of  cancer  
But  for  other  tumors  and  cancer  types, the  improvements  have  only  been  modest  
And  as  a  doctor, i  know  that  once  a  disease  progresses  to  an  advanced  stage  achieving, a  cure  can  be  difficult.
But  i  actually  took  a  completely  opposite  approach  and  began  asking, what  could  we  be  adding  to  our  diet, That's, naturally, antiangiogenic, that  could  boost  the  Body's  defense  system  and  beat  back  those  blood  vessels  that  are  feeding  cancers  
This  inhibits  abnormal  angiogenesis  by  60  percent  
And  you  can  see  clearly  that  the  teas  vary  in  their  potency  from  less  potent  to  more  potent  
This  means  There's  food  synergy, 
Here's  some  more  data  from  our  testing  ,
Now  in  the  lab, we  can  simulate  tumor  angiogenesis  represented  here  in  a  black  bar.
Soy  Parsley, Garlic  grapes  berries. I   could  go  home  and  cook  a  tasty  meal  using  these  ingredients.
And  like  a  tumor  fat  grows  when  blood  vessels  grow  
Albert  Szent-gyorgi  once  said, that  discovery  consists  of  seeing  what  everyone  has  seen  and  thinking  what, no  one  has  thought  
Right  and  along  those  lines  for  people  who  might  have  risk  factors  for  cancer. Would  you  recommend  pursuing  any  treatments  sort  of  Prophylactically, or  simply  pursuing  the  right  diet  with  lots  of  tomato  sauce?
Well, you  know, There's  abundant  epidemiological  evidence, 
I've  designed  puzzles  for  books  printed  things.
But  at  best  they  can  reach  for  something  more  and  create  a  memorable  impression.
It's  all  figure  
Not  strictly  an  ambigram  in  the  conventional  sense.
Now  if  you  could  pick  up  the  black  vase, it  would  look  like  the  figure  on  top  
Here  Let's, make  it  a  little  harder, still  pretty  easy  
I  wanted  to  make  a  sequel  
Garry  Trudeau  calls  himself, an  investigative  cartoonist  
And  i  said, well, how  on  earth?
And  you  have  to  choose  pieces  that  overlap  on  the  edge.
But  it  takes  some  persistence  
First  of  all, you  know, for  a  long  time, computer  games  meant  things  like  doom, where  You're  going  around  shooting  things  very  violent  games  very  fast  aimed  at  teenage  boys  right  That's, who  plays  computer  games.
Well  guess  what  That's  changing  
And  It's  a  game  you  play  with  other  people.
A  lot  of  people  do  Sudoku.
Anybody  
What  i  want  to  talk  about  today  is  this  particular  cell  or  grouping  of  cells  that  is  in  each  and  every  one  of  us  
I  want  you  to  imagine  that  this  particular  grouping  of  cells  is  central  to  the  evolution  of  our  species  and  the  Continuation  of  the  human  race, 
And  i  want  you  imagine  that  at  some  point  in  history, a  group  of  powerful  people  invested  in  owning  and  controlling  the  world  understood  that  the  suppression  of  this  particular  cell, the  oppression  of  these  cells, the  Reinterpretation  of  these  cells, the  undermining  of  these  cells, getting  us  to  believe  in  the  weakness  of  these  cells  and  the  crushing  eradicating  destroying  reducing. These  cells  basically  began  the  process  of  killing  off  the  girl  cell, which  was  by  the  way.
To  be  a  leader  means  not  to  be  a  girl  
And  I'd  also, like  to  say  that  the  irony, of  course, is  that  denying  girl  suppressing  girl: suppressing  emotion, refusing  feeling  has  lead.
Where  we  have  now  come  to  live  in  a  world  where  the  most  extreme  forms  of  violence, the  most  horrific  poverty, genocide, mass  Rapes, the  destruction  of  the  earth  is  completely  out  of  control.
In  the  congo  for  those  of  you  who  Don't  know, there  has  been  a  war  raging  for  the  last  12  years, a  war  that  has  killed  nearly  six  million  people.
Listening  to  the  story  of  80-year-old  women  who  were  tied  to  chains  and  circled  and  where  groups  of  men  would  come  and  rape  them. Periodically  all  in  the  name  of  economic  exploitation  to  steal  the  minerals. So  the  west  can  have  it  and  profit  from  them.
That  shattering  that  opening  of  my  girl  cell  that  kind  of  massive  breakthrough  of  my  heart  allowed  me  to  become  more  courageous  and  Braver  and  actually  more  clever  than  i  had  been  in  the  past  in  my  life.
I  want  to  change  the  verb, 
I  want  the  verb  to  be  educate  or  activate, or  engage  or  confront  or  defy  or  create  
I  know, a  14-year-old  girl  in  the  netherlands, for  example, who  is  demanding  that.
And  i  want  to  talk  about  a  girl  that  i  just  met  recently  in  bukavu  who  was  Impregnated  by  her  Rapist  
She  taught  girls  what  a  healthy  vagina  looked  like  and  what  a  mutilated  vagina  looked  like  
And  she  said, well, now  i  need  a  house  
The  whole  community  has  bought  in  to  what  She's  doing  
She  imagined  her  father  killing  her  on  one  hand  and  mama, agnes  greeting  her  with  the  hope  that  she  would  greet  her  when  she  got  to  the  house  
I  had  the  privilege  of  being  in  the  hut  when  she  was  reunited  with  her  father  and  Reconciled  
In  that  hut  we  walked  in  and  her  father  and  his  four  wives  were  sitting  there  and  her  sisters  who  had  just  returned  because  they  had  all  fled  when  she  had  fled  and  her  primary  mother  who  had  been  beaten  in  standing  up  for  her  with  the  elders  
And  that  is  the  power  of  transformation.
But  i  really  want  to  do  it  for  each  and  every  person  here  to  value, the  girl  in  us  to  value, the  part  that  cries  to  value, the  part  That's  emotional  to  value, the  part  That's  vulnerable  to  understand  That's, where  the  future  lies  
I  rejoice  that  It's  still  in  my  body  
I  am  an  emotional  creature  
I  can  take  you  back  
Nothing's  been  diluted  
I  love  hear  me, i  love  that  i  can  feel  the  feelings  inside  you, even  if  they  stop  my  life, even  if  they  break  my  heart, even  if  they  take  me  off  track, they  make  me  responsible  
Your  body  is  covered  with  fractals  
Let's  see  first  iteration.
So  native  americans  use  a  combination  of  circular  symmetry  and  Fourfold  symmetry.
It  is  not  the  same  pattern  at  two  different  scales.
In  some  cases, there  would  actually  be  algorithms  and  very  sophisticated  algorithms.
So  i  tracked  down  one  of  the  folks  who  makes  these  things  this  guy  in  Mali, just  outside  of  Bamako. And  i  asked  him  how  come  You're  making  fractal  fences  because  nobody  else  is  .
So  these  guys  are  right  on  target  for  a  practical  use  of  scaling.
The  most  complex  example  of  an  algorithmic  approach  to  fractals  that  i  found  was  actually  not  in  geometry. It  was  in  a  symbolic  code. And  this  was  Bamana  sand.
And  finally  out  of  desperation, i  said, well, let  me  explain  Georg  cantor  in  1877  
And  then  you  take  this  symbol  and  you  put  it  back  in  so  It's, a  Self-generating  diversity  of  symbols  
And  i  know, brian  eno  says, There's  not  enough  africa  in  computers.
We  got  a  small  seed  grant  just  to  see  if  folks  would  be  willing  to  work  with  us  on  this  We're  very  excited  about  the  future  possibilities  for  that  
Actually  the  reason  that  google  was  such  a  success  is  because  they  were  the  first  ones  to  take  advantage  of  the  self-organizing  properties  of  the  web.

Anyway, i  like  oprah  --  i  like  her  Girlfriendy-ness, i  like  her  weight  issues, i  like  how  She's  transformed  talk  television. I   like  how  She's  brought  reading  back  to  america  --  but  there  was  something  that  happened  the  last  two  weeks. That  was, i  call  it  the  Soon-yi  moment.
It  makes  what  the  bleep  do.
I  want  to  try  to  share  just  a  little  bit  of  that  with  you  in  this  presentation, 
The  challenge, of  course, is  to  answer  this  question: what  permits  this  extraordinary  performance  of  animals  that  allows  them, basically  to  go  anywhere  
And  if  we  could  figure  that  out, how  can  we  implement  those  designs  
Think  about  it  if  you  were  an  engineer, and  i  told  you  that  you  had  to  build  an  automobile, but  it  had  to  start  off  to  be  this  big. Then  it  had  to  grow  to  be  full  size  and  had  to  work  every  step  along  the  way.
Or  think  about  the  fact  that  if  you  build  an  automobile  I'll, tell  you  that  you  also  --  inside  it  --  have  to  put  a  factory  that  allows  you  to  make  another  automobile  
They  all  produce  the  pattern  of  a  pogo  stick. How  is  that  true?
We  took  their  advice, and  we  modeled  the  animals  moving  in  the  horizontal  plane  as  well. We  took  their  three  legs.
It  Didn't  decrease  its  preferred  speed  at  all  
It  has  six  legs  --  there  are  the  tuned  Springy  legs, 
Robert  full  It'll  go  on  different  surfaces  --  Here's  sand  --  although  we  Haven't  perfected  the  feet  yet, but  I'll  talk  about  that  later, 
Like  if  we  had  a  piece  of  tape  now, We'd  peel  it  this  way.
They  do  this  with  their  toes, It's  bizarre.
And  Here's  the  peeling  action  of  the  Mecho-gecko  
Here's  an  individual  hair, with  a  little  split  end.
No  force  is  too  low.
And  just  recently  We've  made  a  breakthrough  where  we  now  believe  We're  going  to  be  able  to  create  the  first  synthetic  self-cleaning, dry  adhesive.
Thank  you  
We  proved  that  most  of  the  ammonia  refrigeration  tables  are  wrong.
Most  people  have  cooking  fires  in  the  world, whether  It's  camel  dung  or  wood  
And  the  problem  is  this  women  are  not  making  it  to  the  top  of  any  profession  anywhere  in  the  world.
We  also  have  another  problem, which  is  that  women  face  harder  choices  between  professional  success  and  personal  fulfillment  
And  i  said, are  you  telling  me  that  i  am  the  only  woman  to  have  pitched  a  deal  in  this  office  in  a  year  
In  the  high-income  part  of  our  workforce  in  the  people  who  end  up  at  the  top  --  fortune  500, ceo  jobs  or  the  equivalent  in  other  industries  --  the  problem  i  am  convinced  is  that  women  are  dropping  out  
This  is  hard.
My  brother  is, kind  of  busy  
Because  what  the  data  shows  above  all  else  is  one  thing, which  is  that  success  and  Likeability  are  positively  correlated  for  men  and  negatively  correlated  for  women.
This  is  the  complication  
And  That's  a  problem  because  we  have  to  make  it  as  important  a  job  because  It's  the  hardest  job  in  the  world  to  work  inside  the  home  for  people  of  both  Genders, if  We're  going  to  even  things  out  and  let  women  stay  in  the  workforce.
Message  number  three, Don't  leave  before  you  leave  
And  literally, from  that  moment, she  Doesn't  raise  her  hand  anymore. She  Doesn't  look  for  a  promotion. She  Doesn't  take  on  the  new  project.
My  generation  really  sadly  is  not  going  to  change  the  numbers  at  the  top  
If  you  want  to  get  at  the  big  part  --  i  mean  from  a  public  health  level  where  my  training  is  --  You're  looking  at  behavioral  issues, 
We  talk  about  it  in  terms  of  engagement  or  Non-compliance  
So  the  crux  of  it  comes  down  to  this  notion  of  decision-making  --  giving  information  to  people  in  a  form  that  Doesn't  just  educate  them  or  inform  them, but  actually  leads  them  to  make  better  decisions. Better  choices  in  their  lives.
So  they  asked  them  at  the  beginning. Do  you  think  You'll  actually  be  able  to  stick  with  this  program?
So  fear  showed  up  as  not  really  the  driver  
It  was  a  notion  that  really  came  out  of  albert  Bandura's  work  who  studied  whether  people  could  get  a  sense  of  empowerment.
It's, an  amazing  notion, 
And  i  had  to  explain  They're  trying  to  scare  people.
Again, Bandura  recognized  this  years  ago, decades  ago, 
Okay, i  know  where  i  sit, i  know  where  I'm  situated  
And  that  Doesn't  just  work  for  me  in  terms  of  abstract  numbers  --  this  overload  of  health  information  that  We're  Inundated  with  
Finally, we  need  to  be  presented  with  a  clear  point  of  action.
The  choice, in  this  case  is  pretty  simple  
We  either  keep  going  fast, or  we  slow  down  
They  reduce  speeds  by  about  five  to  10  percent  
They  last  for  about  five  miles  in  which  case  we  put  our  foot  back  on  the  pedal  
And  who  among  us  would  actually  say  that  people  who  do  try  to  read  this  actually  get  anything  out  of  it.
They  went  to  the  nutritional  information  box  and  saw  that  what  works  for  cereal  works  for  our  food  actually  helps  people  understand  What's  in  their  food  
They're  just  not  for  us  They're, not  for  people  They're, not  for  patients.
This  is  the  worst  presented  information  
And  then  we  go  a  further  step  --  we  tell  them  what  they  can  do.
So  we  take  the  bold  step  of  putting  the  cholesterol  information  on  the  same  page, which  is  the  way  the  doctor  is  going  to  evaluate  it  
The  last  one  I'll  show  you  is  a  psa  test  
And  the  only  acceptable  answer  is  --  --  yes, 
Okay, on  the  other  hand, by  placing  your  finger  in  a  different  position  on  the  Fingerboard, it  changes  the  string  length  that  changes  the  frequency  of  the  sound  wave.
And  now  i  realize  that  as  the  musician  we  human  beings, we  have  a  great  mind  artistic, heart  and  skill  that  can  change  the  16th-century  technology  and  a  legendary  design  to  a  wonderful  entertainment  
But, although  some  of  them  were  quite  up  there  for  me, 
And  i  realized  we  actually  had  quite  a  bit  in  common. Both  of  us  were  disseminating  the  genes  of  one  species  and  not  another.
We  have  a  grammar  that  suggests  That's  who  we  are  that  we  are  sovereign  subjects  in  nature.
And  That's, when  i  got  the  idea  which  was  well, what  would  happen  if  we  kind  of  looked  at  us  from  this  point  of  view  of  these  other  species  who  are  working  on  us  
And  agriculture  suddenly  appeared  to  me, not  as  an  invention, not  as  a  human  technology. But  as  a  Co-evolutionary  development  in  which  a  group  of  very  clever  species, mostly  edible  grasses  had  exploited  us  figured  out  how  to  get  us  to  basically  Deforest  the  world.
And  suddenly  everything  looked  different  
I'm, a  Dupe  I'm, a  Dupe  of  the  lawns  whose  goal  in  life  is  to  Outcompete  the  trees  who  they  compete  with  for  sunlight.
So  let  me  go  through  what  you  gain  when  you  look  at  the  world, this  way, besides  some  entertaining  insights  about  human  desire, 
As  an  intellectual  matter  looking  at  the  world  from  other  Species'  points  of  view  helps  us  deal  with  this  weird  anomaly, which  is  --  and  this  is  in  the  realm  of  intellectual  history  --  which  is  that  we  have  this  darwinian  revolution.
This  is  a  farm  in  the  Shenandoah  valley  of  virginia.
The  idea  is, He's  got  six  different  species  of  animals  as  well  as  some  plants  growing  in  this  very  elaborate  symbiotic  arrangement  
And  I'll  show  you  if  you  take  this  approach, what  you  get, ok, 
So  one  day  cattle  in  a  pen, 
The  Eggmobile  is  a  very  Rickety  Contraption  --  it  looks  like  a  prairie  Schooner  made  out  of  boards  --  but  it  houses, 350, chickens, 
So  the  chickens  do  their  kind  of  little  Breakdance  and  They're  pushing  around  the  manure  to  get  at  the  grubs, and  in  the  process, They're  spreading  the  manure  out  
And  within  four  or  five  weeks, he  can  do  it  again.
Put  that  in  play  
So  when  they  lose  a  lot  of  leaf  mass, they  shed  roots, they  kind  of  Cauterize  them. And  the  roots  die.
And  They're  labeled  by  color  right  now  by  language  
But  you  can  also  see  there  are  places  where  There's  not  so  much  
But  it  Didn't  have  quite  the  same  pickup  in  the  us.
And  so  i  guess  the  us, finally, finally  started  to  like  it  too  
And  It's  something  I'm  very  excited  to  be  a  part  of  
But  it  was  a  dream  of  his, and  we  basically  when  people  really  want  to  do  something.
You  can  see, even  though  the  us  is  still  the  majority  here  --  though, by  the  way, Search-wise  It's  only  about  30  percent  of  our  traffic  --  but  It's  already  going  to  japan  and  the  uk  and  europe  and  all  the  rest  of  the  countries.
And  --  well, I'll  leave  you  in  Suspense  
So  one  of  the  things  --  both  sergey, and  i  went  to  a  montessori  school, and  i  think  for  some  reason, this  has  been  incorporated  in  google  
And  sergey  mentioned, orkut, which  is  something  that  you  know, orkut  wanted  to  do  in  his  time. And  we  call  this  --  at  google  We've  embodied  this  as  the  20  percent  time.
And  this  was  kind  of  a  surprise  to  me, but  we  found  that  as  long  as  you  keep  the  100  things  in  your  head, which  you  did  by  writing  them  down  that  you  could  do  a  pretty  good  job  deciding  what  to  do, and  where  to  put  your  resources  
So  this  is  a  new  --  how  many  of  you  use  the  google  Toolbar  
And  the  nice  thing  about  this, we  have  a  Self-serve  program  and  many  thousands  of  websites  have  signed  up. And  this  Let's  them  really  make  money. And  i  --  you  know, There's  a  number  of  people  i  met  --  i  met  this  guy  who  runs  a  conservation  site  at  a  party. And  he  said, you  know, i  Wasn't  making  any  money.
And  so  there  is  this  blog  of  a  young  person  who  was  kind  of  depressed.
And  i  think  We're  really  lucky  to  have  that  kind  of  business  model, because  everyone  in  the  world  has  access  to  our  search. And  i  think  That's  a  tremendous  tremendous  benefit.
So  I'm  also  fairly  determined  to  try  and  build  a  game  layer  on  top  of  the  world.
It's, not  very  good  It's, cluttered  
If  You're  not  too  bad  There's, nothing, you  can  do  
It's  actually  about  using  dynamics  using  forces  to  influence  the  behavior  of  where  you  are  what  you  do  there, how  you  do  it  
Come  here  at  a  certain  time, get  your  drinks  half  off  
This  game  dynamic  is  so  powerful  that  it  Doesn't  just  influence  our  behavior.
They  will  return  like  clockwork  at  different  times.
Modern  warfare, one  of  the  most  successful  selling  games  of  all  time.
It's  also  used  in  more  conventional  settings  and  can  be  used  more  consciously  in  conventional  settings  
School  --  and  remember, i  made  it  through  one  year. So  i  think  I'm  qualified  to  talk  on  school  --  is  a  game  It's, just  not  a  terribly  well-designed  game  right?
There  are  Statuses.
That  sucks, why  not  level-up  
And  It's  very  powerful  
I  mean, you  see, this  is  a  Paladin  level, 10  and  That's, a  Paladin  level  20. And  if  you  were  going  to  fight, you  know, Orcs  on  the  fields  of  Mordor  against  the  Raz. Al  Ghul  You'd  probably  want  to  be  the  bigger  one  right?
Their  most  dedicated  players  It's  like  a  full-time  job  
And  We've  introduced  a  progression  dynamic  into  it  where  by  going  to  the  same  place  over  and  over  by  doing  challenges  by  engaging  with  the  business, you  move  a  green  bar  from  the  left  edge  of  the  screen  to  the  right  edge  of  the  screen.
So  we  have  to  use  this  one  carefully  
It's  a  woodworking  machine, or  at  least  a  piece  of  one.
Now, this  gentleman  Isambard  kingdom, brunel  designed  many  great  things  in  his  career  in  the  19th  century, including  the  Clifton  suspension  bridge  in  bristol  and  the  thames  tunnel  at  Rotherhithe  
His  greatest  creation  runs  actually, right  through  here  in  oxford  
He  imagined  an  integrated  transportation  system  in  which  it  would  be  possible  for  a  passenger  to  embark  on  a  train  in  london  and  Disembark  from  a  ship  in  new  york  
And  I'd  like  to  talk  about  some  of  those, just  for  the  next  few  minutes, 
So  it  took  a  team  working  in  india  with  patients  and  community  health  workers  to  understand  how  a  Pda  and  an  application  on  a  Pda  might  replace  those  technicians  in  a  fitting  and  diagnostic  service.
And  the  faster, we  do  that  the  faster, our  ideas  evolve  
This  is  the  manufacturing  facility  for  one  of  their  biggest  cost  breakthroughs: 
They  went  from  retreating  to  the  Nurse's  station  to  discuss  the  various  states  and  needs  of  patients  to  developing  a  system  that  happened  on  the  ward  in  front  of  patients, using  a  simple  software  tool  
And  this  is  just  one  of  thousands  of  opportunities  in  healthcare  alone.
But  again, we  are  in  the  midst  of  massive  change  
How  might  we  improve  access  to  safe  drinking  water  for  the  World's  poorest  people?
What  kinds  of  questions  do?
There  is  a  hash  tag  there  that  you  can  use  #cbdq  
Well, since  i  Couldn't  have  my  tea, the  way  i  wanted  it, i  ordered  a  cup  of  coffee, which  the  waiter  brought  over  Promptly  
But  from  the  japanese  perspective, It's  their  duty  to  protect  those  who  Don't  know  any  better  --  in  this  case, the  ignorant  Gaijin  --  from  making  the  wrong  choice: 
As  i  do  so  i  hope  You'll  start  thinking  about  some  of  your  own  assumptions  and  how  they  were  shaped  by  your  backgrounds.
It  is  essential  for  success.
The  kids  got  to  choose  which  pile  of  anagrams  they  would  like  to  do. And  they  even  got  to  choose  which  marker  they  would  write  their  answers  with  .
In  reality, the  kids  who  were  told  what  to  do  whether  by  miss  smith  or  their  mothers  were  actually, given  the  very  same  activity, which  their  counterparts  in  the  first  group  had  freely  chosen  
In  fact, some  of  the  kids  were  Visibly  embarrassed.
The  first-generation  children  were  strongly  influenced  by  their  immigrant  Parents'  approach  to  choice.
Or  you  could  say  that  the  Individual's  preferences  were  shaped  by  the  preferences  of  specific  others.
Americans  train  their  whole  lives  to  play  spot.
A  number  of  my  studies  have  shown  that  when  you  give  people  10  or  more  options, when  They're  making  a  choice, they  make  poorer  decisions, whether  it  be  health  care, investment, other  critical  areas, 
They'd  already  picked  out  a  name  for  her  barbara  after  her  grandmother,

This  narrative  promises  so  much  freedom.
Instead  of  replacing  one  story  with  another, we  can  learn  from  and  Revel  in  the  many  versions  that  exist  and  the  many  that  have  yet  to  be  written  
No  matter  where  We're  from  and  what  your  narrative  is, we  all  have  a  responsibility  to  open  ourselves  up  to  a  wider  array  of  what  choice  can  do.
It  brings  us  that  much  closer  to  realizing  the  full  potential  of  choice  to  inspiring  the  hope  and  achieving  the  freedom  that  choice  promises, but  Doesn't  always  deliver  
So  i  brought  these  two  bottles  of  nail  polish  into  the  laboratory, and  i  stripped  the  labels  off  
Well, good  morning, 
And  It's, not  just  what  these  are  doing  to  each  other, but  It's  what  the  audience  thinks  that  really  frames  this  matter, 
To  get  a  sense  of  this  and  It's  been  a  theme  We've  talked  about  all  week.
Girl, 5  because  They're  going  to  lose  all  their  money, eventually, 
Doesn't  work  out  too  well  for  them, they  lose  money.
The  Rocket's  position  is  shown  by  the  trajectory  that  We're  now, looking  at  
And  as  it  reaches  the  peak  of  its  trajectory, the  velocity, you  will  notice  has  dropped  off  to  a  minimum  
But  like  Let's, imagine  we  took  the  latest  pentium  processor, the  latest  core, 2  extreme, which  is  a  Four-core  processor  that  Intel's  working  on. It  will  be  our  laptop  tomorrow.
So  --  and  we  Haven't  even  worked  out  the  cooling  needs  
Every  effort  has  been  made  and  will  continue  to  be  made  to  find  a  new  pattern, new  selling  arrangements  and  new  types  of  programs  that  may  arrest  the  declining  revenues  
It  may  yet  be  possible  to  Eke  out  a  poor  existence  for  radio, but  i  Don't  know  how  
It  was  the  dawn  of  interactive  tv, and  you  may  have  noticed  they  wanted  to  sell  you  the  winky  dink  kits  
Pete  i  could  use  any  ordinary  open-source  crayon.
But  we  will  discuss  this  scandal  because  this  man, jack  berry, the  host  of  winky  dink  went  on  to  become  the  host  of  twenty  one, one  of  the  most  important  quiz  shows  ever  
We'll  talk  a  little  bit  more  about  him  later.
It's, the  era  of  big  business  and  data  centers  for  computing  
It  all  happened  within  five  miles  of  where  I'm  standing  at  stanford  university  between  1960  and  1975  
Hypercard  was  the  first  program  to  introduce  the  public  to  Hyperlinks  where  you  could  randomly  hook  to  any  kind  of  picture  or  piece  of  text  or  data  across  a  file  system. And  we  had  no  way  of  explaining  it.
Once  it  was  only  a  dream  of  Technoids  and  a  few  Long-forgotten, politicians, 
And  further  stimulus  came  with  the  deregulation  of  the  cable  television  industry  and  the  Re-regulation  of  the  cable  television  industry, 
Voice  2: next  on  the  gourmet  pet  channel  decorating  birthday  cakes  for  your  Schnauzer  
We  come  into  the  era  of  the  dotcom  the  world  wide  web. And  i  Don't  need  to  tell  you  about  that, because  we  all  went  through  that  bubble  together.
Voice, 1  You'll  have  to  stay  here  in  the  safe  house  until  we  get  word.
And  media  companies  realize  the  audience  is  important, also, 
And  i  think  this  is  beginning  to  happen  in  the  entertainment  business.
They  think  of  the  old  medium  because  the  old  medium  is  always  the  content  of  the  new  medium, as  movies  tend  to  be  the  content  of  tv.
And  i  used  three  criteria. The  first  was, i  thought, I'd  talk  about  real  design  within  reach  design, That's, free, not  design, not  quite  within  reach  as  We're  Fondly  known  by  our  competition  and  competitors, but  stuff  that  you  can  find  on  the  streets  stuff  that  was  free  stuff  that  was  available  to  all  people  and  stuff  that  probably  contains  some  other  important  messages.
Wholly  inconsistent  with  san  francisco  or  new  york  
How  did  i  get  started  in  this  business?
In  italy, you  know, almost  everything  kind  of  looks  good  
I've  come  across  some  other, just  kind  of  curious  relationships  of  Bollards  on  the  street  that  have  different  interpretations.
And  i  came  down  one  day  and  all  the  bikes  were  red  
And  at  that  moment, the  sun  came  out  and  through  this  Perforated  screen, a  pattern  was  cast  over  these  bodies, and  they  kind  of  faded  into  the  rear, and  we  left  the  restaurant  kind  of  feeling. Ok, about  stuff.
Cities  are  the  place  where  We're  most  likely  to  encounter  diversity  and  to  mix  with  other  people  
And  It's  a  welcoming  area, i  think  inclusive  of  diversity  reflective  of  diversity.
And  i  decided  i  had  to  get  closer  than  just  drawing  fantasy  airplanes.
You  had  to  learn  what  made  an  airplane  stay  in  the  air  
I  had  to  learn  mathematics  and  mechanics, and  all  this  sort  of  thing  
So  i  chose  furniture  
And  i  chose  chairs  specifically  because  i  knew  something  about  them  
There  are  Drawbacks  to  this  
One  is  you  Can't  accommodate  everybody  
So  he  said, well, I'll  come  over  and  look  at  it.
So  here  we  are  
So  if  you  watch  this  chair, as  i  recline, the  headrest  comes  up  to  meet  my  neck.
You  Cant  hit  your  elbow  on  bottom  
What  does  that  mean?
And  you  realize  that  you  spend  it  in  a  variety  of  different  places.
You  spend  it  at  rest  and  you  spend  it  at  work.
So  then  i  decided  to  leave  that  part  of  the  world, and  i  was  going  to  go  to  the  Mid-west  
Very  nice, and  there  my  older  senior  lungs, as  i  like  to  call  them, i  filled  with  Particulate  matter, carbon  dioxide  and  very  high  doses  of  ozone  
Okay, almost  like  the  highest  in  the  nation, 
So  What's  wrong  with  this  picture  
They  Haven't  asked  me  what  kind  of  the  quality  of  the  drinking  water  that  i  put  in  my  mouth  or  the  food  that  i  ingest  into  my  stomach.
Now, I've  circled  the  places  where  I've  been  
Oh, not  so  lucky, 
They  give  us  some  sense  of  What's  going  to  be  our  train  wreck  
And  all  of  those  black  dots  are  all  of  the  toxic  release  Inventories  that  are  monitored  by  the  epa.
This  is  what  the  physician  would  have  in  front  of  him  and  her  when  we  enter  that  exam  room, instead  of  just  the  pink  slip, that  said, i  paid  at  the  counter  right?
And  i  believe  that  geographic  information  can  make  both  you  and  me  very  healthy.
So  
They  take  you  to  Gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriagedad  
I'd  be  like  some  kind  of  internet  genius  and  me  I'd  like  to  upgrade  to  deity  and  maybe  just  like  that  --  pop  --  I'd  go  wireless.
I  could  zip  through  your  servers  and  Firewalls  like  a  virus  until  the  world  wide  web  is  as  wise  as  wild  and  as  organized  as  i  think  a  modern-day  Miracle/oracle  can  get  but  Ooh-eee.
You  Don't  say, a  prayer  
Thank  you  ted  
So  for  roughly  300  years, the  hot  debate  in  architecture  was  whether  the  number  five, or  the  number  seven  was  a  better  proportion  to  think  about  architecture  because  the  nose  was  one-fifth  of  your  head, or  because  your  head  was  One-seventh  of  your  body.
So  whenever  you  lost  information, You'd  move  to  symmetry. Whenever  you  added  information  to  a  system, you  would  break  symmetry.
Now, the  only  way  we  could  design  that  or  possibly  construct  it  is  by  using  a  calculus-based  definition  of  the  form.
It  also  is  much  more  dynamic, so  that  you  can  see  that  the  same  form  opens  and  closes  in  a  very  dynamic  way  as  you  move  across  it  because  it  has  this  quality  of  vector  in  motion, built  into  it.
You  just  need  to  incorporate  a  certain  number  of  traits  in  a  very  kind  of  genetic  way.
I  Won't  go  into  too  much  description  of  any  of  these  projects.
So  working  with  Bentley  and  Microstation  We've, written  a  custom  piece  of  software  that  networks  all  of  the  components  together  into  these  chunks  of  information.
But  what  it  gives  us  is  a  Harmonic  and  synthesized  relationship  of  all  these  components.
At  the  same  time, There's  a  person, paying  30000  dollars  for  a  300-series  car  and  a  person  paying  70000  dollars  for  a  700  series. And  that  person  paying  more  than  double  Doesn't  want  their  car  to  look  too  much  like  the  Bottom-of-the-market  car.
So  they  have  to  also  discriminate  between  these  products  
To  go  back  to  architecture  What's, organic  about  architecture  as  a  field. Unlike  product  design  is  this  whole  issue  of  Holism  and  of  Monumentality  is  really  our  realm.
And  to  do  that, we  tried  to  connect  up  the  five  towers  into  a  single  system.
With  united  architects, also, we  made  a  proposal  for  the  european  central  bank  headquarters  that  used  the  same  system.
So  for  these  interiors, like  this  shop  in  stockholm, sweden  or  this  installation  wall, in  the  netherlands, at  the  netherlands  architecture  institute, we  could  use  the  texture  that  the  tool  would  leave  to  produce  a  lot  of  the  spatial  effects, and  we  could  integrate  the  texture  of  the  wall  with  the  form  of  the  wall  with  the  material.
What  I'd  like  to  do  is  just  drag  us  all  down  into  the  Gutter, and  actually  all  the  way  down  into  the  sewer. Because  i  want  to  talk  about  diarrhea.
And  in  particular, i  want  to  talk  about  the  design  of  diarrhea.
If  instead  transmission  to  another  host  requires  host  mobility, then  we  expect  that  the  winners  of  the  competition  will  be  the  Milder  organisms.
So  one  way  you  can  test  is  just  look  at  all  diarrheal  bacteria  and  see  whether  or  not  the  ones  that  tend  to  be  more  transmitted  by  water  tend  to  be  more  harmful.
After  a  few  days  of  infection, you  end  up  having  --  the  Fecal  material, really  Isn't.
And  if  you  took  a  drop  of  that  water, you  might  find  a  million  diarrheal  organisms  
If  it  Didn't  produce  a  lot  of  this  toxin, then  you  might  find  a  smaller  number  :
So  the  task  is  to  try  to  figure  out  how  to  determine  whether  or  not  you  could  get  an  organism  like  this  to  evolve  towards  mildness. By  blocking  waterborne  transmission, thereby  allowing  the  organism  only  to  be  transmitted  by  person-to-person  contact  or  Person-food-person  contact  --  both  of  which  would  really  require  that  people  be  mobile  and  fairly  healthy  for  transmission.
One  would  be  to  take  a  lot  of  different  strains  of  this  organism  --  some  that  produce  a  lot  of  toxins, some  that  produce  a  little  --  and  take  those  strains  and  spew  them  out  in  different  countries.
So  we  Don't  want  to  run  an  experiment  like  that  
Now, i  Don't  know  how  that  happened, and  i  Didn't  have  anything  to  do  with  it.
The  goal  is  to  turn  this  around  
If  you  could  cause  an  evolutionary  decrease  in  virulence  by  cleaning  up  the  water  supply, you  should  be  able  to  get  an  evolutionary  decrease  in  antibiotic  resistance.
And  i  want  to  give  you  just  one  more  example, because  We've  talked  a  little  bit  about  malaria  
In  the  case  of  malaria, what  We'd  like  to  do  is  Mosquito-proof  houses, 
The  only  pathogens  that  get  transmitted  are  the  ones  that  are  infecting  people  that  feel  healthy  enough  to  walk  outside  and  get  mosquito  bites  
So  i  Don't  really  have  time  to  talk  about  those  things, but  i  did  want  to  put  them  up  there.
And  the  data  really  do  support  this  that  you  actually  do  get  the  virus  evolving  towards  mildness.
Anyhow, I'll  end  that  there, and  thank  you  very  much  
Our  hands  are  amazing, instruments, 
And  when  They're  missing  It's, a  barrier, 
Every  time  you  contract  a  muscle, it  emits  a  little  electricity  that  you  can  record  with  antennae  or  electrodes  and  use  that  to  operate  the  motorized  prosthesis  
Well, the  body  works  by  starting  a  motor  command  in  your  brain, going  down  your  spinal  cord  out  the  nerves  and  to  your  periphery.
And  we  take  the  nerve  away  from  your  chest  muscle  and  let  these  nerves  grow  into  it  
Now, you  think  close  hand  and  a  little  section  of  your  chest  contracts.
And  Jesse's  a  good  crane  operator, and  he  did  okay  by  our  standards, 
So  this  is  really  exciting  for  us. Because  now  we  have  a  portal  a  portal  or  a  way  to  potentially  give  back  sensation, so  that  he  might  feel  what  he  touches  with  his  prosthetic  hand.
We've  also  gone  on  with  what  was  initially  our  primary  population  of  people  with  Above-the-elbow  Amputations  
You  had  to  concentrate  a  whole  lot  
Then  we  fit  her  with  a  prosthesis  
A  little  faster  and  much  more  easy  much  more  natural  
There's  a  lot  of  information  in  those  nerve  signals.
And  here  you  can  see  on  Jesse's  chest  when  he  just  tried  to  do  three  different  things, you  can  see  three  different  patterns.
Obviously  That's  heavy  for  amanda  
It  took  just  about  probably  three  to  four  hours  to  get  it  to  train  
So  We're  really  excited, because  now  We're  getting  to  a  clinically  practical  device.
I  want  you  to  watch  closely  
That's  Claudia, and  that  was  the  first  time  she  got  to  feel  sensation  through  her  prosthetic  
Once  we  can  do  it  that  small  It's, a  lot  easier  making  them  bigger  
So  amanda  came  Jet-lagged  She's  using  the  arm  and  everything  goes  wrong.
And  none  of  those  problems  could  i  have  dealt  with, but  i  have  a  really  bright  research  team.
But  first  i  want  to  start  by  saying  that  we  need  a  new  operating  system  for  the  oceans.
Because  We've  only  doubled  the  population  of  the  earth  since  the  1960s  --  a  little  more  than  doubled  --  but  we  have  67  billion  people  in  the  world.
Humans, without  fins, 90  meters  35  minutes, 
So  penguins  are  amazing  athletes, 
And  more  importantly, They're  Well-dressed  
If  you  go  and  do  it  now  the  national  parks  count  about  500  
So  we  have  a  quarter  of  the  penguins  that  we  did  40  years  ago.
When  we  have  extreme  el  nino  events, you  see  all  this  red, and  you  see  no  green  out  here  around  the  galapagos.
Things  die  when  There's  no  food  
And  if  you  look  along  the  coast  of  argentina  where  i  work  now  at  a  place  called  punta  tombo  --  the  largest  magellanic  penguin  colony  in  the  world  down  here, about  44  degrees, south  latitude  --  you  see  that  There's  great  variation  here, 
And  so  we  have  started  a  global  penguin  society  to  try  to  focus  on  the  real  plight  of  penguins  
They  ended  up  swimming  through  ballast, water  that  had  oil  in  it  
So  we  ended  up  spending  nine  years  convincing  the  government  that  there  were  lots  of  oiled  penguins.
And  of  course, all  of  this  then  leads  to  a  vicious  cycle, and  you  Can't  raise  a  lot  of  chicks.
Turbo  has  taken  to  knocking  on  the  door  with  his  beak, we  let  him  in. And  he  comes  in  here.
So  this  is  turbo  
And  now  He's  looking  at  the  other  guy, saying, you  are  really  weird  
Most  important  thing  is, only  you  can  change  yourself, and  only  you  can  change  the  world  and  make  it  better  for  people  as  well  as  penguins  
But  Let's  talk  about  the  90  percent  of  the  world  population  that  will  never  leave  the  place  in  which  they  were  born  
Over  50  new  countries  were  born  
And  they  share  a  Lengthy  land  border  
In  fact, the  world  bank  predicts  that  Russia's  population  is  declining  towards  about  120  million  people. And  there  is  another  thing  that  you  Don't  see  on  this  map.
Stalin  khrushchev  and  other  soviet  leaders  forced  russians  out  to  the  far  east  to  be  in  Gulags  labor  camps, nuclear  cities.
As  a  result  in  the  russian  far  east  today, which  is  twice  the  size  of  india, you  have  exactly  six  million  russians.
Because  globalization  opens  up  all  kinds  of  ways  for  us  to  undermine  and  change  the  way  we  think  about  political  geography  
Remember  the  40  dots  on  the  nighttime  map  that  show  the  hubs  of  the  global  economy  
And  now, many  of  you  have  been  reading  in  the  news, how  people  are  looking  to  china  to  lead  the  rebound, the  economic  rebound, not  just  in  asia, but  potentially  for  the  world  
So  china  is  becoming  the  anchor  of  the  economy  in  the  region.
China  has  signed  military  agreements  with  many  countries  in  the  region.
All  of  this  is  happening  without  firing  a  shot  
So, what  can  we  do  to  think  about  borders  differently  in  this  part  of  the  world, 
What  i  want  to  present  to  you  is  what  i  call  state  building  day  by  day  
The  kurds  for  3000  years  have  been  waging  a  struggle  for  independence.
Now, remember, kurdistan  is  Landlocked  
And  therefore  it  has  to  have  Amicable  relations  with  them.
The  lesson  from  kurdistan  and  from  palestine  is  that  independence  alone, without  infrastructure  is  futile  
The  last  time  that  was  the  case  was  actually  a  century  ago  during  the  ottoman  empire.
But  today, the  hejaz  railway  lies  in  Tatters  ruins  ,
More  pipelines  means  more  silk  roads.
In  2004, 15  new  countries  joined  the  eu  
Even  if  these  regions  Aren't  part  of  the  eu, they  are  becoming  part  of  its  sphere  of  influence  
So  What's  next, where  are  we  going  to  see  borders  change  and  new  countries?
If  we  were  to  look  at  all  of  africa, we  could  most  certainly  acknowledge  far  more  tribal  Divisions  and  so  forth.
It  has  three  ongoing  civil  wars, the  genocide  in  darfur, which  you  all  know  about  the  civil  war  in  the  east  of  the  country  and  south  sudan  
But  if  you  look  in  nature, you  see  that  different  kinds  of  animals  can  have  really  different  lifespans  
Now, these  animals  are  different  from  one  another  because  they  have  different  genes.
And  we  Didn't  study  any  of  these  animals  
Is  it  miserable.
And  if  you  look  at  the  tissues  of  the  animal  They're, starting  to  deteriorate  ,
And  now, here  is  the  daf-2  mutant  
But  It's, really  more  like  this  Let's, say, You're  a  30  year-old  guy  --  or  in  your  30s  --  and  You're  a  bachelor  and  You're  dating.
She  says, I'm, 60, 
Well, as  you  know  genes, which  are  part  of  the  dna  They're  instructions  to  make  a  protein  that  does  something  
It  says  that  aging  is  subject  to  control  by  the  genes, and  specifically  by  hormones  
So  after  we  made  our  discoveries  with  little  c, Elegans  people  who  worked  on  other  kinds  of  animals  started  asking  if  we  made  the  same  daf-2  mutation  the  hormone  receptor  mutation  in  other  animals, will  they  live  longer  
They  hardly  get  cancer, and  when  they  do  It's, not  as  severe  
So  in  a  daf-2  mutant  --  you  see  that  i  have  the  x  drawn  here  through  the  receptor  
The  receptor  Isn't  working  as  well  
And  many  of  these  different  genes  We've  shown  actually  contribute  to  the  long  lifespan  of  the  daf-2  mutant  
Then  they  promote  the  uptake  of  nutrients  
So  he  Doesn't  actually  do  anything  himself.
We  Don't  know  the  details  of  how  this  works, but  we  do  know  then  that  foxo  genes  can  impact  the  lifespan  of  people  
But  in  this  case, There's  already  a  drug  called  rapamycin  that  binds  to  the  tor  protein  and  inhibits  its  activity.
So  people  take  it  to  prevent  organ  transplants  from  being  rejected  
You  could  change  the  genes  in  principle, 
So  it  might  be  that  you  would  just  have  to  fine  tune  it  very  carefully  to  get  the  benefits  without  getting  any  problems.
I  Wasn't  suggesting  that  i  was  going  to  go  and  do  it, but  
Just  move  to  one  side  for  us  if  you  would  
And  when  you  look  at  these  70  year-old  turtles, you  Can't  tell  the  difference  just  by  looking  between  those  turtles  and  20  year-old  turtles  
They're  more  resistant  to  these  kinds  of  stresses  
They're, not  getting  old  in  the  Dog's  lifespan.
Here's  another  good  article  about  a  new  campaign, opposing  privatization  of  transit  without  any  contact  information  for  the  campaign.
The  message  seems  to  be  that  the  readers  are  most  likely  to  want  to  eat  maybe  read  a  book  maybe  see  a  movie, but  not  be  engaged  in  their  community.
They  all  have  heroes  who  were  chosen  
This  helps  me  understand  why  a  lot  of  people  have  trouble  seeing  themselves  as  leaders, because  it  sends  all  the  wrong  messages  about  what  leadership  is  about  
As  long  as  We're  teaching  our  kids  that  heroism  starts  when  someone  Scratches  a  mark  on  your  forehead, or  someone  tells  you  that  You're  part  of  a  prophecy, They're  missing  the  most  important  characteristic  of  leadership, which  is  that  it  comes  from  within  
Which  leads  us  to  the  last  one, which  is  our  elections  
So  i  was  privileged  to  train  in  transplantation, under  two  great  surgical  pioneers  thomas  Starzl, who  performed  the  World's  first  successful, liver  transplant  in  1967  and  sir  roy  Calne, who  performed  the  first  liver  transplant  in  the  uk.
In  the  following  year, 
But  not  all  patients  on  the  transplant.
And  the  gift  of  life  has  been  extended  from  brain-dead  donors  to  living  related  donors  --  relatives  who  might  donate  an  organ  or  a  part  of  an  organ  like  a  split  liver  graft  to  a  relative  or  loved  one  
No  doubt, i  was  informed.
And  at  that  time, stem  cell  research  had  gained  momentum  following  the  isolation  of  the  World's.
And  as  it  turns  out  fat  is  one  of  the  best  sources  of  adult  stem  cells.
If  this  research  is  successful, it  may  then  reduce  the  need  to  research  and  sacrifice  human  embryos.
It  is  a  fact  that  when  our  organs  or  tissues  are  injured, our  bone  marrow, releases  stem  cells  into  our  circulation, 
There  are  170  clinical  trials  investigating  the  role  of  stem  cells  in  heart  disease.
We  are  very  happy, because  we  have  the  opportunity  to  have  this  angel  in  the  world  --  not  only  in  our  country, venezuela, but  in  our  world  
He  has  given  us  the  possibility  to  have  dreams, and  to  make  true  the  dreams  
And  here  are  the  results  of  this  wonderful  project  that  is  the  system  in  venezuela, 
He  buys  a  ring, she  buys  a  dress  
These  optimistic  young  bastards, promise  to  honor  and  cherish  each  other  through  hot, flashes  and  Mid-life  crises  and  a  cumulative  50-lb  weight  gain  until  that  Far-off  day, when  one  of  them  is  finally  able  to  rest  in  peace.
And  some  of  them  will  even  still  be  enjoying  each  Others'  company  when  neither  of  them  can  chew  solid  food  anymore, 
What  do  the  folks  who  make  it  all  the  way  to  side-by-side  burial  plots  have  in  common  
And  they  try  to  pinpoint  what  it  is  that  sets  them  apart  from  their  miserable  neighbors  and  friends  
It's  obvious  that  this  leads  to  marital  bliss  because  women  we  care  a  great  deal  about  being  thin  and  good, looking  whereas  men  mostly  care  about  sex  ,
So  instead  of  all  that  laborious, Dieting  and  exercising, we  just  need  to  wait  for  them  to  get  fat, maybe  bake  a  few  pies  
These  are  couples  who  can  find  good  in  any  situation.
This  is  an  actual  study, and  let  me  clarify  
Now  i  Don't  know  how  old  all  of  you  are. But  when  i  was  a  kid, your  parents  took  pictures  with  a  special  kind  of  camera  that  held  something  called  film.
I'm  serious  
So  I'm, obviously  going  to  need  Fatten  him  up.
I  have  a  Doppelganger  
That's  exactly  what  i  do  --  optical  mind  control  
Even  if  we  could  measure  what  every  cell  is  doing  at  all  times, we  would  still  have  to  make  sense  of  the  recorded  activity  patterns  and  That's  so  difficult  chances  are  We'll  understand  these  patterns, just  as  little  as  the  brains  that  produce  them  
To  make  progress, we  need  to  break  the  code.
The  approach  works  so  well, that  we  can  write  purely  artificial  messages  directly  to  the  brain  
These  headless  bodies  can  live  for  about  a  day, but  they  Don't  do  much  
Now  for  an  intelligent  being  like  our  fly, this  policy  is  not  written  in  stone, but  rather  changes  as  the  animal  learns  from  experience.
So  we  bred  flies  whose  brains  were  more  or  less  randomly  peppered  with  cells  that  were  light  Addressable  
Whenever  it  comes  up  to  the  Midpoint, it  pauses  it  carefully  scans  the  odor  interface  as  if  it  was  sniffing  out  its  environment.
These  12  cells  as  shown  here  in  green, send  the  output  to  a  brain  structure  called  the  mushroom  body, which  is  shown  here  in  gray  
If  the  connection  is  strong, the  motors  will  turn  on  and  the  fly  will  initiate  a  turn  
In  a  situation  like  this, we  would  expect  the  critic  to  speak  up  and  to  tell  the  actor  to  change  its  policy.
So  the  next  time, the  fly  finds  itself  facing  the  same  odor  again.
Now, in  terms  of  Biomimetics  as  human  technologies, take  on  more  of  the  characteristics  of  nature, nature  becomes  a  much  more  useful  teacher, 
Now, being  a  biologist, i  was  very  curious  about  this  
These  are  gecko  toes.
And  the  individual  has  2  billion  of  these  nano-size  split  ends.
So  what  they  did  was  they  asked  us  an  important  question: ,
They're  climbing  up  a  wall  or  a  tree  
Now, That's  real  time.
So  they  do  it  with  this  active  tail  as  they  swing  around  
Okay, there  it  goes  
It  Oscillates  its  tail  up  and  down  like  a  dolphin.
But  watch  its  front  legs.
So  now  we  were  really  confused  because  there  are  no  reports  of  it.
One  of  the  problems  is  coming  up  with  the  right  target.
There's, not  a  lot  of  science  behind  that  one  either  
Now, why  is  this  so  complicated  
Volcanoes, Eject  Aerosols  into  the  atmosphere.
So  Here's, the  thing  it  sounds  like  a  simple  question: 
That's  the  ross  sea  ice  shelf  on  the  right  there.
You  can  go  then  and  study  corals  and  figure  out  how  often  do  you  see  this  
And  it  been  growing  for  about  600  years  
You  can  see  some  of  the  coral  cores  there  on  the  right  
That  the  place  where  during  an  earthquake  in  1954, this  marine  terrace  was  lifted  up  out  of  the  ocean  very  quickly.
And  so  now  you  can  walk  through  a  coral  reef  without  getting  wet  
There's  a  whole  family  of  curves  here, 
Some  of  the  records  show  lower  temperatures  than  others.
And  there  is  natural  variability  caused  by  the  sun  caused  by  el  ninos.
There's  consequences  for  carbonate, organisms  
The  main  framework, material  of  coral  reefs  is  calcium  carbonate.
And  on  coral  reefs, where  some  of  the  main  framework  organisms  disappear, we  will  see  a  major  loss  of  marine  biodiversity.
You  know, these  are  things  that  we  have  good  physiological  reasons  to  expect  to  see  stressed  caused  by  this  Transience  
You  have  to  go  back  about  30  million  years  to  find  a  time  when  co2  levels  were  double, what  they  are  today.
That's  the  reason  that  They're  not  able  to  respond  or  adapt  to  this  rapid  acidification, That's  going  on  right  now  
And  i  think  that  may  very  well  be  true.
And  a  long  time  ago  --  well, about  40  years  ago  --  my  mom  had  an  exchange  student  
This  is  donna  at  the  statue  of  liberty.
But  I'd  like  to  talk  about  another  way  to  travel  that  Doesn't  require  a  ship  or  an  airplane  and  just  requires  a  movie  camera, a  projector  and  a  screen  
And  That's  what  I'm  going  to  talk  to  you  about  today.
So  I'm  the  living  product  of  two  cultures  coming  together, 
To  change  the  arab  nightmare  into  the  american  dream  
Josh  rushing  the  night  they  showed  the  Pows  and  the  dead  soldiers  --  al  jazeera  showed  them  --  it  was  powerful  because  america  Doesn't  show  those  kinds  of  images  
And  it  upset  me  on  a  profound  level  that  i  Wasn't  bothered  as  much  the  night  before  
Jehane  Noujaim, i  was  overwhelmed  by  the  response  of  the  film  for  we  Didn't  know  whether  it  would  be  able  to  get  out  there.
And  i  saw  this  with  audiences  
Man, god  forbid, 
If  you  were  not  abu  Azzam's  daughter, 
In  this  life  We're  dead  anyway, 
Woman, perhaps  we  have  to  turn  it  into  a  moral  war.
Zvika, i  said, ok, That's, Bat-chen, That's, my  daughter, 
Are  you  sure  she  is  dead  
When  we  got  to  here, we  saw  three  israeli  military  jeeps  parked  on  the  side  of  the  road.
George, but  there  is  a  teacher  that  is  in  charge  
But  after  thinking, logically  about  it, i  Didn't  find  any  reason  why  not  to  meet  them. And  let  them  know  of  our  suffering.
We  see  that  there  are  palestinians  who  suffered  a  lot  who  lost  children, and  still  believe  in  the  peace  process  and  in  reconciliation.
Yes, yes, 
But  I've  been  trying  to  think  about  ways  to  give  power  to  these  independent  voices  to  give  power  to  the  filmmakers  to  give  power  to  people  who  are  trying  to  use  film  for  change  
There's  just  vision  that  are  working  with  palestinians  and  israelis  who  are  working  together  for  peace, and  documenting  that  process  and  getting  interviews  out  there. And  using  this  film  to  take  to  congress  to  show  that  It's  a  powerful  tool  to  show  that  this  is  a  woman  Who's  had  her  daughter  killed  in  an  attack.
There's  working  films  and  There's  current  tv, which  is  an  incredible  platform  for  people  around  the  world  to  be  able  to  put  their  --  yes, It's.
There  are  people  that  want  to  be  a  part  of  this  global  day  of  film  to  be  able  to  provide  a  platform  for  independent  voices  and  independent  films  to  get  out  there.
In  the  year  1919, a  virtually  unknown  german  mathematician  named  Theodor, kaluza  suggested  a  very  bold. And  in  some  ways, a  very  bizarre  idea.
That  is, in  addition  to  left  right  back  forth  and  up  down  kaluza  proposed  that  there  might  be  additional  dimensions  of  space  that  for  some  reason  we  Don't  yet  see  
How  is  it  that  the  sun  93  million  miles  away  [that]? Somehow  it  affects  the  motion  of  the  earth.
He  like  einstein  was  in  search  of  what  we  call  a  unified  theory.
Maybe  i  can  play  the  same  game  with  the  other  known  force, which  was  at  that  time  known  as  the  electromagnetic  force  --  we  know  of  others  today.
Now, but  for  those  of  us  who  are  a  little  bit  more  practically  minded  two  questions  immediately  arise  from  his  observation, 
It's  very  hard  to  see  it, though, from  far  away  
So  many  people  worked  on  it, but  by  the  '40s, certainly  by  the  '50s, this  strange, but  very  compelling  idea  of  how  to  Unify  the  laws  of  physics  had  gone  away.
In  our  era, a  new  approach  to  Unify  the  laws  of  physics  is  being  pursued  by  physicists, such  as  myself, many  others  around  the  world  It's  called  Superstring  theory.
And  there  you  see  unification  because  matter  particles  electrons  and  quarks  radiation  particles, photons  Gravitons  are  all  built  up  from  one  entity.
One  of  the  other  predictions  of  string  theory  --  no  That's, not  one  of  the  other  predictions  of  string  theory.
And  that  question  is  this  when  we  look  around  the  world  as  scientists  have  done  for  the  last  hundred  years, there  appear  to  be  about  20  numbers  that  really  describe  our  universe  
Not  yet  
But  we  believe  the  answer  for  why  those  numbers  have  the  values  they  do  may  rely  on  the  form  of  the  extra  dimensions.
This  is  an  example  of  something  known  as  a  Calabi-yau  shape  --  name, Isn't  all  that  important  
But  as  you  can  see  the  extra  dimensions, fold  in  on  themselves  and  Intertwine  in  a  very  interesting  shape, interesting  structure  
And  the  idea  is  that  if  this  is  what  the  extra  dimensions  look  like, then  the  microscopic  landscape  of  our  universe, all  around  us  would  look  like  this  on  the  tiniest  of  scales.
And  this  is  an  experiment  that  may  test  for  them  in  our  lifetime  
And  yet, even  at  this, most  fundamental  level  context  is  everything  
And  now  you  see  it  
There  is  no  a  priori  reason  why  an  h  has  to  go  between  that  w  and  a  
So  you  Don't  do  it  again, 
Your  brain  is  learning  and  It's  learning  that  the  right  side  of  its  visual  field  is  under  red  illumination. The  left  side  of  its  visual  field  is  under  green  illumination.
I  take  it  from  your  response. They  Don't  look  the  same  anymore, right?
Why  because  if  the  tile  in  that  shadow  were  in  fact, in  shadow  and  reflecting  the  same  amount  of  light  to  your  eye  as  the  one  outside  the  shadow, it  would  have  to  be  more  reflective  --  just  the  laws  of  physics, 
Which  means  we  can  bring  all  this  information  together  to  create  some  incredibly  strong  illusions.
And  they  land  on  the  flower, they  stick  their  tongue  in  there  called  a  proboscis, and  they  drink  sugar, water  
So  they  are  using  the  relationships  between  the  colors  to  solve  the  puzzle, which  is  exactly  what  we  do.
So  illusions  are  often  used, especially  in  art. In  the  words  of  a  more  contemporary  artist  to  demonstrate  the  fragility  of  our  senses.
Instead  color  tells  us  something  completely  different  that  the  brain  Didn't  actually  evolve  to  see  the  world, the  way  it  is  
We  Can't, instead  the  brain  evolved  to  see  the  world, the  way  it  was  useful  to  see  in  the  past  
Well, one  of  the  ways  we  do  in  my  lab  and  studio  is  we  translate  the  light  into  sound, and  we  enable  people  to  hear  their  visual  world  
So  working  with  kids, they  created  images  thinking  about  what  might  the  images  you  see  sound  like  if  we  could  listen  to  them  
So  now, what  i  want  to  do  I'm  going  to  put  the  middle  nine  surfaces  here  under  yellow  illumination  by  simply  putting  a  filter  behind  them, 
The  question  is, is  that  an  illusion  
And  They're  different  
And  you  can  make  your  own  decision, and  then  You'll  decide  whether  the  invasion  was  worth.
That's  how  you  think  about  security  --  in  terms  of  the  trade-off  
I'll  give  you  the  short  answer  
Now, most  of  the  time  that  works  
We've  developed  this  ability  because  it  makes  evolutionary  sense.
The  unknown  is  perceived  to  be  riskier  than  the  familiar  
If  you  hear  a  lot  about  tiger  attacks, there  must  be  a  lot  of  tigers  around  
When  something  is  so  common  It's, no  longer  news  --  car  crashes, domestic  violence  --  those  are  the  risks.
There's, no  real  word  for  stuff  that  makes  us  secure, but  Doesn't  make  us  feel  secure  
And  there  are  two  ways  to  do  this  
Enough, real  world  examples  helps  
Security, Theater's, exposed  when  It's  obvious  that  It's  not  working  properly  
If  for  example, terrorism  almost  never  happens  It's  really  hard  to  judge  the  efficacy  of  Counter-terrorist  measures  
It  Doesn't  change, It's, real  ,
We  Couldn't  have  a  germ  theory  of  disease  before  we  invented  the  microscope  to  see  them  
Where  do  we  get  these  models? We  get  them  from  others.
Think  of  models  of  terrorism, child: kidnapping  airline  safety  car, safety  
Models  can  come  from  industry.
For  us  We're  very  Facile  around  electricity, 
Now, it  had  a  name  which  made  it  Scarier  than  the  regular  flu, even  though  it  was  more  deadly.
As  the  novelty  wore  off  the  months  went  by  there  was  some  amount  of  tolerance.
We  have  feeling  model  reality  
New  models  that  extend  long  periods  of  time  are  hard  
Global  warming  is  a  great  example: 
Strong; feelings; can  create  a  model  
And  That's, okay, 
Now, what  we  want  is  people  to  get  familiar  enough  with  better  models  --  have  it  reflected  in  their  feelings  --  to  allow  them  to  make  security  trade-offs.
Remember, i  said, feeling  model  reality. I   said, reality, Doesn't  change.
Someone  else  bought  it  and  died  
All  human  life, all  life  depends  on  plants.
And  plants  sometimes  find  it  rather  difficult  to  move, because  there  might  be  cities  and  other  things  in  the  way, 
So  if  all  human  life  depends  on  plants  Doesn't, it  make  sense  that  perhaps  we  should  try  to  save  them.
All  the  genetic  information  for  future  generations  of  plants  are  held  in  seeds, 
So  all  around  the  world, people  are  doing  the  same  thing.
This  is  at  least  100  times  bigger  
How  much  does  it  cost  
The  future  research  is, how  can  we  find  the  genetic  and  molecular  markers  for  the  viability  of  seeds  without  having  to  plant  them?
And  it  was  found  close  to  here.
Some  lasted  14-and-a-half  minutes,

The  rules  of  engagement, how  to  talk  when  to  talk  and  how  to  deal  with  them  
We  just  have  to  Persevere  
Everybody  seems  to  agree  with  that  
But  now, as  we  prepare  to  talk, we  understand  how  little  we  know  
Should  we  talk  to  hamas  
Now, my  diplomats  are  instructed  to  talk  to  all  these  groups.
But  talking  can  be  done  in  different  ways, 
We  make  a  distinction  between  talking  from  a  diplomatic  level  and  talking  at  the  political  level, 
In  his  memoirs, long  road  to  freedom.
Now, south  african  friends  will  know  that  was  very  painful  
Dialogue  is  not  easy  --  not  between  individuals, not  between  groups, not  between  governments  --  but  it  is  very  necessary.
But  that  strategy  seldom  takes  you  very  far  
We  could  never  have  done  the  convention  against  Anti-personnel  landmines  and  the  convention  that  is  banning  cluster  munitions  unless  we  had  done  diplomacy  differently  by  engaging  with  civil  society.
How  are  we  going  to  solve  climate  change  through  negotiations  unless  we  are  able  to  make  civil  society  and  people  not  part  of  the  problem?
What  is  the  legitimacy  of  diplomacy  of  the  the  solution  we  devise  as  diplomats, if  they  Cannot  be  reflected  and  understood  by  also  these  broader  forces  of  societies  that  we  now  very  loosely  call  groups  
The  diplomatic  toolbox  is  actually  full  of  different  tools. We  can  use  to  strengthen  our  communication.
In  my  country, i  have  seen  how  the  council  of  islamist  groups  and  christian  groups  came  together, not  as  a  government  initiative, but  they  came  together  on  their  own  initiative  to  establish  contact  and  dialogue  in  times  where  things  were  pretty  Low-key  tension.
How  are  we  going  to  settle  and  build  a  bigger?
So  I'm  in  chile, in  the  atacama  desert, sitting  in  a  hotel  lobby  because  That's  the  only  place  that  i  can  get  a  wi-fi  connection. And  i  have  this  picture  up  on  my  screen. And  a  woman  comes  up  behind  me.
And  you  know, excuse  me, 
This  is  a  Gentoo  penguin, and  she  was  still  skeptical.
So  one  of  the  things  that  i  love  to  do  is  travel  around  the  world  and  look  at  archaeological  sites  
And  one  thing  that  Isn't  a  mystery  actually  was  when  i  grew  up  --  because  when  i  was  a  little  kid  I'd  seen  these  pictures  --  and  i  thought, well, why  that  look  on  the  face  
In  fact, in  many  of  the  statues, when  you  excavate  them, the  backs  are  totally  smooth  --  almost  glass, smooth, 
We're  trying  to  get  all  of  the  Permissions  to  get  everything  all  set  to  get  it  going  
In  this  case, We're  working  with  a  major  medical  foundation  to  develop  inexpensive  ways  of  diagnosing  diseases  in  developing  countries.
Various  parts  of  the  world  will  have  a  cult  food  that  people  get  enormously  attached  to  --  There's, tremendous  traditions, There's  secrecy, 
And  I'm  trying  to  use  a  very  scientific  approach  
So  i  do  a  lot  of  work  on  dinosaurs.
Not  the  same  one, actually, this  is  a  cast, which  i  had  bought. And  then  after  buying  the  cast, i  found  my  own, and  i  Don't  have  room  for  two  .
It's  something  that  can  inform  all  sorts  of  science  in  unexpected  ways.
These  days  bits  are  cheap, unfortunately, that  means  You've  got  to  spend  more  time  sorting  through  them.
Then  a  little  bit  later, i  start  getting  some  pictures  like  this  
That's  kind  of  what  It's  like  
And  you  know, when  i  was  at  microsoft, that  was  so  Engrossing  and  the  whole  industry  was  expanding  so  much  that  it  did  tend  to  crowd  out  most  of  the  other  things  in  my  life.
The  sound  made  Flicking  a  wall  switch  off, is  of  a  completely  different  nature.
Or  the  recorded  Crowing  of  a  rooster

You  were  late  for  school  again.
We  have  Fading  memories  of  that  provisional.
The  next  story  is  called  the  Haverpiece  collection, a  Nondescript  warehouse  visible  for  a  moment  from  the  Northbound  lanes  of  the  Prykushko  Expressway  serves  as  the  temporary  resting  place  for  the  Haverpiece  collection  of  european  dried  fruit  
Do  you  remember  wandering  as  a  child  through  those  dark  wooden  Storefront  galleries  
A  shoe  made  of  Apricot  leather  for  the  daughter  of  a  Czar  
And  that  this, in  fact, will  be  the  way  that  we  treat  cancer  in  the  future.
It  is  very  useful  in  certain  circumstances.
It's  the  one  theory  that  the  biologists  ever  really  got  right  
You  predict  a  black  hole, and  you  look  out  the  telescope  and  there  it  is  just  like, you  said, 
And  so  we  can  discover  things  that  probably  you  could  have  found  by  looking  at  enough  of  your  relatives, but  they  may  be  surprising  
And  applied  minds  gets  a  lot  of  calls  from  people  who  want  help  with  their  problems. And  i  Didn't  think  this  was  a  very  likely  one  to  call  back. So  i  kept  on  giving  him  to  the  delay  list.
And  I'll  show  you  what  that  protein  measurement  looks  like  
We  sort  out  the  proteins  --  from  left  to  right, is  the  weight  of  the  fragments  that  We're  getting  and  from  top  to  bottom  is  how  slippery  they  are.
And  you  can  see  how  the  lines  occur  in  these  little  groups  of  bump  bump  bump  bump  bump  
And  many  people  in  this  audience, probably  Wouldn't  be  alive.
Well, It's  in  the  kitchen.
So  your  house  is  dealing  with  leaks  all  the  time, but  It's, fixing  them, It's, draining  them  out  and  so  on  
And  so  i  gave  this  talk  and  said, why  Don't  you  guys  do  this  
But  design  a  program  of  treatments  specifically  for  you  and  help  your  body  guide  back  to  health  --  guide  your  body  back  to  health  
So, thank  you  very  much.
Now  i  want  to  tell  you  a  quick  story.
Super  bowl  i  heard  it  over  here.
And  there  were  even  some  polls  that  were  saying  she  was  going  to  go  all  the  way.
But  when  we  talked  to  people, it  appeared  that  a  funnel  effect  had  happened  in  these  tribes, all  across  the  united  states, 
But  not  just  work  It's  within  these  tribes  that  societies  get  built  that  important  things  happen.
If  you  focus  in  on  a  group  like  this  --  this  happens  to  be  a  usc  game  --  and  you  zoom  in  with  one  of  those  super  satellite  cameras  and  do  Magnification  factors. So  you  could  see  individual  people  you  would, in  fact, see  not  a  single  crowd, just  like  there  is  not  a  single  crowd  here. But  you  would  see  these  tribes  that  are  then  coming  together.
Not  all  tribes  are  the  same, and  what  makes  the  difference  is  the  culture  
This  is  the  kid  who  shot  up  virginia, tech  
So  this  other  book  that  steve  mentioned  that  just  came  out  called  the  three  laws  of  performance, my  colleague, steve  Zaffron, and  i  argue  that  as  people  see  the  world, so  they  behave  
Well, if  people  see  the  world  in  such  a  way  that  life  sucks, then  their  behavior  will  follow  automatically  from  that  
Now, my  birthday  is  coming  up  shortly  and  my  Driver's  license, Expires  
The  amount  of  world-changing  behavior  that  would  happen  
A  whole  group  of  people  communicating  that  way  talking  that  way, 
Now, we  find  these  in  places  where  really  smart  successful  people  show  up  
It  was  not  christmas  time.
There  is, in  fact, another  stage  
There  was  no  road  map. No  one  had  ever  done  anything  like  this  before.
And  people  at  the  time  feared  that  south  africa  would  end  up  going  the  way  that  rwanda  has  gone  Descending  into  one  Skirmish  after  another  in  a  civil  war, that  seems  to  have  no  end.
What  about  martin  luther  king  
In  fact, martin  luther  King's, most  famous  line  was  at  stage  three  
48  percent  of  working  tribes  say, these  are  employed  tribes, say, I'm, great  and  You're, not  
But  you  Don't  leave  them  where  you  found  them.
I  Don't  know  anybody  
We  move  people  from  stage  one  to  stage  two  by  getting  them  in  a  new  tribe, and  then  over  time, getting  them  connected  
But  We're  not  done  yet, because  then  how  do  we  go  from  stage  four, which  is  great  to  stage  five  
Incidentally, they  did  pull  it  off  
And  they  released  the  first-ever  world  poll.
We're  here  to  celebrate  compassion, 
But  kindness  is  an  everyday  byproduct  of  all  the  great  virtues  
And  in  that  light  for  the  religious  compassion  also  brings  us  into  the  territory  of  mystery  --  encouraging  us, not  just  to  see  beauty.
The  communities  that  jean  vanier  founded  like  jean  vanier  himself, exude  tenderness, 
And  compassion  can  also  have  those  qualities  
And  compassion  is  unleashed  in  wider  and  wider  circles  by  signs  and  stories. Never  by  statistics  and  strategies.
Rachel  naomi  remen  says, this  is  an  important  and  empowering  story  for  our  time.
This  is  going  to  change  science. I   believe  and  it  will  change  religion.
Einstein  believed  deeply  that  science  should  transcend  national  and  ethnic  Divisions  
But  he  watched  physicists  and  chemists  become  the  Purveyors  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction  in  the  early  20th  century, 
So  in  this  photograph, you  see  a  mind  looking  out  a  window  at  what  might  be  a  cathedral  --  It's, not  
Thank  you  
Camp  was  more  like  a  Keg  party  without  any  alcohol  
And  it  went  like  this  R-o-w-d-i-e  That's, the  way  we  spell  Rowdie  
And  i  just  waited  for  the  time  that  i  could  go  off  and  read  my  books  
And  i  was  always  going  off  to  crowded  bars  when  i  really  would  have  preferred  to  just  have  a  nice  dinner  with  friends.
So  even  if  You're  an  extrovert  yourself, I'm  talking  about  your  coworkers  and  your  spouses  and  your  children  and  the  person  sitting  next  to  you  right  now  --  all  of  them  subject  to  this  bias. That  is  pretty  deep  and  real  in  our  society.
Shyness  is  about  fear  of  social  judgment.
So  the  key  then  to  maximizing  our  talents  is  for  us  all  to  put  ourselves  in  the  zone  of  stimulation  that  is  right  for  us.
And  also  we  have  this  belief  system  right  now  that  i  call  the  new  Groupthink, which  holds  that  all  creativity. And  all  productivity  comes  from  a  very  oddly  Gregarious  place.
And  the  vast  majority  of  teachers  reports  believing  that  the  ideal  student  is  an  extrovert, as  opposed  to  an  introvert, even  though  introverts  actually  get  better  grades  and  are  more  knowledgeable.
Now, i  think  at  this  point  It's  important  for  me  to  say  that  i  actually  love  extroverts  
The  same  religions  who  send  their  Sages  off  to  lonely  mountain  tops, also  teach  us  love  and  trust  
Here's  margaret  Atwood  Cat's  eye, 
But  Here's  the  thing  about  my  grandfather  
It  was  my  version  of  my  Grandfather's  hours  of  the  day  alone  in  his  library  
And  i  call  this  my  year  of  speaking  dangerously  
But  we  need  much  more  privacy  and  much  more  freedom  and  much  more  autonomy  at  work.
We  need  to  be  teaching  kids  to  work  together  for  sure, but  we  also  need  to  be  teaching  them  how  to  work  on  their  own  .
And  That's, okay, 
Then  about  the  initiative  that  chris  mentioned  that  we  decided  to  launch  at  amd  that  we  call  50x15  
He  explained  to  me  about  Johann  Strauss  and  how  he  created  the  waltzes  that  became  so  famous  in  the  world.
That's  year  by  year, this  comes  from  our  friends  at  Gapmindercom  
So  we  talked  about  ways  in  which  perhaps  one  could  partner  to  be  able  to  bring  the  cost  of  this  technology  down  
And  frankly  --  and  i  know  that  sometimes  i  offend  some  of  my  customers  when  i  say  this, but  i  truly  mean  it  --  if  you  could  take  the  name  of  the  computer  off  the  top  of  it, it  would  be  very  difficult  to  judge  who  made  it  because  They're  all  highly  commoditized. But  They're  all  different  .
And  the  last  piece, which  is  really  important  --  and  this  is  an  opinion  that  we  have  not  shared  by  many.
We  just  recently  opened  a  learning  laboratory  in  a  school  in  the  west, cape  in  south  africa  in  a  school  That's  called  nelson  mandela  school.
And  We're  really  thrilled  about  the  opportunity  to  be  part  of  this  and  Can't, wait  to  see  what  comes  out  of  this: exciting, exciting  activity  
I'll  tell  you  that  one  of  the  things  that  i  feel  is  really  critical  for  us  in  industry  in  business  is  to  be  able  to  be  passionate  about  solving  these  problems.
I  was  eager  to  go  off  to  college  and  go  find  girls  and  study  and  girls  and  study.
And  on  my  wedding  day, my  father  came  to  me  again  and  said, you  know, I'm  going  to  remind  you  again  that  each  generation  has  to  do  better  than  the  last  one  
Just  existing  
I  really  think  That's  There's: this  inner  desire, 
And  all  of  a  sudden, it  brought  a  lot  of  money  and  a  lot  of  attention.
That's  kind  of  a  no-brainer  
So  what  is  it  for  
So  i  believe  essentially  that  leadership  is  stewardship.
This  is  not  my  planet.
Do  you  think  we  have  a  stewardship  here  to  take  the  environment  seriously, 
What  we  believe  obviously  --  and  you  know  this  --  determines  our  behavior  and  our  behavior  determines  what  we  become  in  life  
My  wife  and  i  first  made  five  decisions  on  what  to  do  with  the  money.
We  just  said, We're  not  going  to  use  it  on  us.
Believe  me  There's  a  whole  lot  easier  ways  to  make  money.
The  last  thing  we  did  is  we  became  what  i  call  reverse.
And  that  is  when  my  wife  and  i  got  married  30  years  ago, we  started  Tithing  
Materialism  is  all  about  getting  --  get  get  get  get  all, you  can  can  all  you  get  sit  on  the  can  and  spoil  the  rest  
And  we  think  that  the  good  life  is  actually  looking  good  --  That's  most  important  of  all  --  looking  good, feeling, good  and  having  the  goods  
There's  a  chapter  in  the  bible  called  psalm, 72  and  It's  Solomon's  prayer  for  more  influence  
Basically  He's  talking  about  all  the  marginalized  in  society.
It's, a  Shepherd's  staff, 
And  by  the  way, my  god  Doesn't  have  to  show  up  on  cheese  bread  
You  know, if  God's  going  to  show  up  He's, not  going  to  show  up  on  cheese  bread  
But  he  Doesn't  do  miracles  just  to  show  off  
What  do  you  do  with  a  Shepherd's  staff?
You  pull  them  or  you  poke  them  one  or  the  other  
And  it  represents  your  influence  
And  that  gives  with  you  enormous  influence  
What  are  you  doing  with  what  You've  been  given  
Why  would  god  wire  you  to  do  something?
And  in  some  countries  --  let  me  pick  afghanistan  --  75  percent  of  the  little  girls  Don't  go  to  school  
So  in  the  three  years, since  i  talked  at  ted  and  showed  a  prototype  It's  gone  from  an  idea  to  a  real  laptop, 
We  have  about  a  quarter  of  a  million  in  transit  to  those  and  other  children. And  then  there  are  another  quarter  of  a  million  more  that  are  being  ordered  at  this  moment.
And  that  engine  is  going  to  see  the  results  in  20  years.
They  own  the  laptops, they  take  them  home.
And  the  reason  she  brought  her  mother  is  that  this  six-year-old  child  had  been  teaching  her  mother  how  to  read  and  write  
So  It's, 1995  I'm  in  college  and  a  friend, and  i  go  on  a  road  trip  from  Providence, rhode  island  to  portland, oregon, 
We  get  it  in  the  abstract  
But  the  thing  is, the  coyote  runs  off  the  cliff, right  after  him, 
That's  when  he  falls  
This  is  not  mine  by  the  way.
We  learn  these  really  bad  lessons  really  well  
When  the  vice  president  for  health  care  quality  at  beth  israel  spoke  about  this  incident.
And  yeah, it  is  also  why  we  get  things  wrong  
I  just  imagined  it  everywhere, which  has  happened.
And  the  Crypto-theme  is  'i  thought, this  one  thing  was  going  to  happen, and  something  else  happened  Instead'. And  the  thing  is  says, ira  glass.
But  you  know, our  stories  are  like  this  because  our  lives  are  like  this  
And  something  else  happened  instead  
Because  half  the  stuff  That's, the  most  mind-boggling  and  World-altering  --  ted  1998  --  eh, 
We  come  up  with  another  idea, 
Bioenergy  Isn't  global  warming. Bioenergy  is  something  which  seems  counterintuitive. Bioenergy  is  oil  It's, gas, It's  coal  and  part  of  building  that  bridge  to  the  future  to  the  point  where  we  can  actually  see  the  oceans  in  a  rational  way, or  put  up  these  Geo-spatial  orbits  that  will  twirl  or  do  microwaves, or  stuff  is  going  to  depend  on  how  we  understand  bioenergy  and  manage  it. And  to  do  that, you  really  have  to  look  first  at  agriculture.
Maybe  That's  one  of  the  reasons  why  if  you  fly  over  west, texas  the  types  of  wells  that  You're  beginning  to  see  Don't, look  unlike  those  pictures  of  kansas  and  those  Irrigated  plots  
Which  is  curious  as  we  debate  all  this  stuff, but  as  you  think  of  coal, this  is  what  burned  wheat  kernels  look  like, not  entirely.
That  is  what  bioenergy  is  it  is  not  ethanol. It  is  not  subsidies  to  a  few  companies. It  is  not  importing  corn  into  iowa  because  You've  built. So  many  of  these  ethanol  plants, it  is  beginning  to  understand  the  transition  that  occurred  in  agriculture  from  brute  force  into  biological  force. And  in  the  measure  that  you  can  do  that, you  can  clean  some  stuff, and  you  can  clean  it.
But  in  the  meantime  for  the  next  decade, at  least  the  name  of  the  game  is  hydrocarbons  and  be  that  oil, be  that  gas  be  that  coal. This  is  what  We're  dealing  with. And  before  i  make  this  talk  too  long, Here's  What's  happening  in  the  current  energy  system.
86  percent  of  the  energy  we  consume  are  hydrocarbons. That  means  86  percent  of  the  stuff  We're  consuming  are  probably  processed  plants  and  amoebas  and  the  rest  of  the  stuff  and  There's  a  role  in  here  for  conservation  There's  a  role  in  here  for  alternative  stuff. But  We've  also  got  to  get  that  other  portion  right?
And  what  gave  her  inspiration  and  meaning  was  the  fact  that  she  was  taking  care  of  people  who  were  far  away  from  home.
In  the  wake  of  the  dotcom  crash  and  9/11  san  francisco  bay  area  hotels  went  through  the  largest  percentage  revenue  drop  in  the  history  of  american  hotels.
And  i  initially  ended  up  in  the  business  section  of  the  bookstore, looking  for  a  business  solution.
Each  of  us  no  matter  what  our  role  is  in  business  has  some  hierarchy  of  needs  in  the  workplace.
So  as  i  started  reading  more  maslow, what  i  started  to  realize  is  that  maslow  later  in  his  life  wanted  to  take  this  hierarchy  for  the  individual  and  apply  it  to  the  collective  to  organizations  and  specifically  to  business  
But  as  we  started  asking  ourselves  about  how  we  were  addressing  the  higher  needs  of  our  employees  and  our  customers, i  realized  we  had  no  metrics  
So  i  went  out  and  studied  a  bunch  of  things, and  i  found  a  survey  that  showed  that  94  percent  of  business  leaders  worldwide, believe  that  the  intangibles  are  important  in  their  business  things  like  intellectual  property, their  corporate  culture, their  brand  loyalty. And  yet  only  five  percent  of  those  same  leaders  actually  had  a  means  of  measuring  the  intangibles  in  their  business.
And  He's  a  very  wise  man. And  he  said, listen, Bhutan's  goal  is  not  to  create  happiness.
One  of  those  key  indicators  is, how  do  the  bhutanese  feel  about  how  they  spend  their  time  each  day?
Or  in  other  words, i  think  the  bhutanese  believe  happiness  equals  wanting  what  you  have  --  imagine  gratitude  --  divided  by  having  what  you  want  --  gratification  
So  it  suggests  that  the  momentum  is  shifting  
As  you  look  at  these  two  columns  here, Doesn't  it  make  you  feel  like  It's  time  for  us  to  start  figuring  out  a  new  way  to  count  a  new  way  to  imagine  What's  important  to  us  in  life.
We're  spending  10  billion  dollars  on  the  census  
We're  asking  10, simple  questions  --  it  is  simplicity  
They're  about  demographics  
Abe  maslow  said, long  ago, something  You've  heard  before. But  you  Didn't  realize  it  was  him  .
He  said, if  the  only  tool  you  have  is  a  hammer, everything  starts  to  look  like  a  nail  
In  Vivian's  case, her  unit  of  production  Isn't  the  tangible  hours. She  works  It's.
He  stayed  there  a  hundred  times  in  the  last  20  years  and  He's  loyal  to  the  property  because  of  the  relationship  that  vivian  and  her  fellow  employees  have  created  with  him  
We  Don't  have  to  choose  between  inspired  employees  and  sizable  profits, we  can  have  both  
At  least, as  he  wrote  when  a  robot  dies, you  Don't  have  to  write  a  letter  to  its  mother.
The  us  is  currently  ahead  in  military  robotics  right  now. But  we  know  that  in  technology, There's, no  such  thing  as  a  permanent, first  move  or  advantage.
There's  already  a  Jihadi  website  that  you  can  go  on  and  remotely  Detonate, an  ied  in  iraq, while  sitting  at  your  home  computer  
Soldiers  have  a  name  for  these  clips.
The  typical  one  that  i  was  sent  was  an  email  that  had  an  attachment  of  video  of  a  predator  strike, taking  out  an  enemy  site  missile  hits  bodies  burst  into  the  air  with  the  explosion.
It  was  set  to  music  
And  so  we  kind  of  have  this  kind  of  moral  feel-good  moment.
That  bottle  winds  up  getting  burned  
And  so  poor  people  who  are  making  these  products  in  petrochemical  centers, like  cancer  alley, poor  people  who  are  consuming  these  products  disproportionately  and  then  poor  people  who  even  at  the  tail  end  of  the  recycling  are  having  their  lives  shortened  are  all  being  harmed  greatly  by  this  addiction  that  we  have  to  disposability  
Now, you  think  to  yourself  --  because  i  know  how  you  are  --  you  say, that  sure  is  terrible  for  those  poor  people  
It's  just  awful  those  poor  people  
I  hope  someone  does  something  to  help  them  
But  guess  what  
We  Don't  have  disposable  resources.
And  as  we  all  begin  to  come  back  to  that  basic  understanding  new  opportunities  for  action, begin  to  emerge.
But  if  we  want  to  make  something  hard, we  come  up, i  know  I'm  going  to  make  a  hard  substance  
We  just  had  this  vote  and  Everybody's  like  well, not  in  our  state  
Just  so  proud  
But  california, though  we  lead  the  world  in  some  of  the  green  stuff, we  also  unfortunately  lead  the  world  in  some  of  the  Gulag  stuff.
We  have  a  moral  challenge  in  this  moment, 
And  really  they  fundamentally  told  you, are  you  going  to  hug  a  tree, or  are  you  going  to  hug  a  child, pick  
Well, when  you  start  working  on  issues  like  plastic, you  realize  that  the  whole  thing  is  connected. And  luckily, most  of  us  are  blessed  to  have  two  arms.
They'd  worn  themselves  out  beating  themselves  against  the  window.
I've  called  this  vehicle  Generically  a  volantor  after  the  latin  word, Volant  meaning  to  fly  in  a  light  nimble  manner.
Volantor-like  helicopter  perhaps  
The  press  calls  my  particular  volantor, a  skycar  
One  could  say  that  a  helicopter  does  pretty  much  what  the  hummingbird  does  and  gets  around  in  much  the  same  way  and  It's  true. But  a  helicopter  is  a  very  complex  device.
Because  if  You're  in  this  world  where  computers  are  controlling  what  You're  doing  It's  going  to  be  very  critical  that  something  Can't  fail  on  you  
Well, you  Can't  right  now  take  off  from  your  home  because  It's  too  noisy  
I  mean  to  be  able  to  take  off  from  your  home  You'd  have  to  be  extremely  quiet  
After  all, if  you  can  fly  like  that, why  are  you  going  to  drive  around  on  a  highway  
You  can  play  computer  games. You  can  sleep. You  can  read  on  the  way.
And  then  through  the  various  years, we  invented  various  vehicles  
Redundancy  is  the  critical  issue  here.
If  you  want  to  stay  alive, You've  got  to  have  Backups  
That's  a  very  significant  incentive  for  getting  out  of  san  francisco, 
But  you  better  be  the  first  one  out  of  town  as  the  real  estate  values, go  to  hell.
There's  an  interesting  poll  that  came  out  recently  under  Nas  --  i  think  It's  Msnbc  --  in  which  they  asked  the  question, are  you  in  the  market  for  a  volantor? ?
I  mean, think  about  how  much  we  love  this  
Think  about  that  
What  dr? Soljacic, figured  out  how  to  do  was  separate  the  Coils  in  a  transformer  to  a  greater  distance  than  the  size  of  those  Transformers  using  this  technology, which  is  not  dissimilar  from  the  way, an  opera  singer, Shatters, a  glass  on  the  other  side  of  the  room.
And  what  I'm  going  to  do  is  to  show  you  pretty  much  What's  here, 
And  if  the  demo  gods  are  willing  in  about  10  seconds  or  so  we  should  see  it  
Think  about  it, you  Don't  want  those  ugly  cords  coming  down, 
Imagine  if  you  can  get  rid  of  it  
And  I'll  do  it  again, just  for  Safety's  sake, 
We're, an  equal  opportunity  designer  of  this  sort  of  thing, 
It  runs  the  android  operating  system  
So  we  put  a  little  sleeve  on  the  back, but  we  should  be  able  to  get  this  guy  to  wake  up  too  
And  think  of  what  that  would  do  for  you  
And  third, our  bodies  are  filters  and  Storehouses  for  environmental  toxins.
If  You're  Cremated  all  those  toxins, i  mentioned  are  released  into  the  atmosphere.
So  by  trying  to  preserve  our  dead  bodies, we  deny  death  poison  the  living  and  further  harm  the  environment  
I  realize  this  is  not  the  kind  of  relationship  that  we  usually  aspire  to  have  with  our  food  
The  decompiculture  society  shares  a  vision  of  a  cultural  shift  from  our  current  culture  of  death  denial  and  body  preservation  to  one  of  decompiculture, a  radical  acceptance  of  death  and  Decomposition  
So  the  virtual  earth  initiative  and  other  types  of  these  initiatives  are  all  about  extending  our  current  search.
Well, a  little  unknown  secret  is  his  brother  actually  works  on  the  virtual  earth  team.
When  we  think  about  how  all  this  comes  together, It's, all  about  software  algorithms  and  math  
We  do  this  all  through  software  algorithms  and  math  --  a  highly  automated  pipeline  creating  these  cities  
But  what  We've  found  is  they  like  the  fluidity  of  the  3-d  model, 
I'm  going  to  use  these  two  countries  to  make  an  economic  argument  for  democracy, rather  than  against  democracy  
Look  at  the  skyline  of  shanghai, 
The  picture  on  india  is  the  dharavi  slum  of  mumbai  in  india.
In  an  interview  printed  in  the  financial  press  of  india, he  said  that  he  wants  to  make  mumbai  another  shanghai, 
This  is  an  Oxford-trained  economist  steeped  in  humanistic  values. And  yet  he  agrees  with  the  High-pressure  tactics  of  shanghai.
This  is  a  very  little  known  fact  about  the  two  countries.
The  economy  grows  government, accumulates  more  resources, and  the  government  can  invest  in  infrastructure  --  rather  than  infrastructure, being  a  cause  for  economic  growth.
One  reason  is  the  east  asian  model  
Korea  succeeded, north  korea, Didn't  ,
Burma, Didn't  succeed, 
In  china, It's  all  women  
By  looking  at  these  two  pictures, i  say, no, it  Won't  overtake  china  for  a  while  
Actually  the  answer  is  more  nuanced  and  subtle  than  that  
Indira, gandhi  declared  emergency  rule  in  1975  
Why  do  many  people  believe  that  india  is  still  a  growth  disaster  
But  china  is  a  superstar  in  terms  of  economic  growth.
This  is  the  grand  cafe  here  in  oxford  
That's  its  great  claim  to  fame. And  i  wanted  to  show  it  to  you  not  because  i  want  to  give  you  the  kind  of  starbucks  tour  of  historic  england. But  rather  because  the  english  coffeehouse  was  crucial  to  the  development  and  spread  of  one  of  the  great  intellectual  Flowerings  of  the  last  500  years. What  we  now  call  the  enlightenment?
What  are  the  environments  that  lead  to  unusual  levels  of  innovation, unusual  levels  of  creativity, 
And  this  is  what  they  ended  up  coming  with  
It's  called  a  Neonurture  device.
In  the  inside  It's  all  car  parts  
It's  got  a  fan, It's  got  headlights  for  warmth.
This  is  Hogarth's  famous  painting  of  a  kind  of  political  dinner  at  a  Tavern.
And  one  of  the  problems  with  this  is  that  people  are  actually  --  when  you  research  this  field  --  people  are  notoriously  unreliable  when  they  actually  kind  of  Self-report  on  where  they  have  their  own  good  ideas  or  their  history  of  their  best  ideas.
So  when  they  were  sitting  in  front  of  the  microscope, when  they  were  talking  to  their  colleague  at  the  water  cooler  and  all  these  things  
But  That's  a  key  thing: 
And  so  they  ask  around  to  a  couple  of  their  colleagues  and  Everybody's  like  no, i  Hadn't  thought  of  doing  that  
And  so  Guier  and  Weiffenbach  go  back  to  Weiffenbach's  office, and  they  start  kind  of  Noodling  around  --  hacking  as  we  might  call  it  now.
We  should  record  it  
And  they  thought  about  it, and  they  said, well, i  guess  maybe  you  could  Let's  run  the  numbers  here.
And  i  bet  you  one  of  you, if  not  more  has  used  said  device  and  said, satellite  system  to  locate  a  nearby  coffeehouse  somewhere  in  the  last  --  in  the  last  day, or  last  week, right  
Chance  favors  the  connected  mind  
My  story  starts  way  before  i  was  born  
They  got  on  and  Didn't  know  where  they  were  going  and  ended  up  in  canada.
I  was  14, and  i  emailed  professors  at  the  local  university  to  see  if  maybe  i  could  go  work  in  their  lab.
And  so  i  thought, maybe  if  it  can  promote  cell  growth, it  can  inhibit  cell  death, too  
And  so  That's  the  project  that  i  pursued  for  that  year  and  It's  continuing  now  as  well  and  found  that  a  specific  purine  derivative  called  Guanidine, had  inhibited  the  cell  growth  by  approximately  60  percent  
But  I'd  heard  of  cancer  as  the  most  feared  disease  of  our  time. So  how  did  the  good  and  bad  go  together?
And  while  i  was  doing  this, i  was  reading  the  cancer  literature  trying  to  --  again  --  Familiarize  myself  with  this  new  medical  field, 
And  it  was  really  interesting  --  there  were  articles  Correlating.
It  Hasn't  yet  become  fine-tuned  enough  to  finish  what  has  been  initiated  
If  we  eliminate  cancer  the  way  We're  trying  to  do  now  with  chemotherapy  and  radiation, We're, Bombarding  the  body  or  the  cancer  with  toxins  or  with  radiation, trying  to  kill  it  
We're  removing  the  cancer  cells, but  We're, revealing  the  previous  damage  that  the  body  has  tried  to  fix  
So  this  really  changed  my  view  of  looking  at  cancer  
And  what  metastases  are  is  when  the  tumor  --  when  a  piece  --  breaks  off  and  travels  through  the  blood  stream  and  goes  to  a  different  organ  That's, what  a  Metastasis  is  
But  then, again, this  fact  that  the  metastases  Didn't  go  to  skeletal  muscle  made  that  seem  unlikely  
And  i  guess  I'll  keep  investigating  until  i  get  the  answers.
Is  it  possible  that  muscle  somehow  intuitively  knows  that  it  needs  this  blood  supply. It  needs  to  be  constantly  contracting. So  therefore  It's  almost  selfish  It's  grabbing  its  blood  vessels  for  itself.
And  i  hate  to  say  that, but  it  seems  as  though  muscle  cell  possibly  because  of  all  its  use  has  adapted  faster  than  other  body  tissues  to  respond  to  injury  to  Fine-tune  this  repair  response  and  actually  be  able  to  finish  the  process  which  the  body  wants  to  finish. I   really  believe  that  the  human  body  is  very, very  smart, and  we  Can't  counteract  something.
And  again, some  of  these  may  be  far-fetched, but  i  figured  if  There's  anywhere  to  present  far-fetched  ideas  It's  here  at  ted. So  thank  you  very  much.
Some  of  you  have  heard  the  story  before, but  in  fact, There's  somebody  in  the  audience, Who's, never  heard  this  story  --  in  front  of  an  audience  --  before  so  I'm  a  little  more  nervous  than  i  normally  am  telling  this  story.
And  then  my  translator  left  
They  slept  on  the  floor  at  night  
I  had  photographed, as  i  said, a  lot  of  these  kids  
Again, not  at  all  shy  or  Withdrawn, or  anything  like  the  other  children  that  I'd  photographed  
It  was  very  obvious  from  the  very  beginning  that  she  was  a  leader  
And  i  said  to  my  translator  What's  going  on, why  is  she  crying  ?
And  i  said, I'm, 28  years  old, and  i  live  in  hotels  and  I'm, not  married  
And  they  had  no  idea  about  this  request  that  She'd  made  of  me  
So  i  finally  found  myung  sung, her  best  friend  that  she  used  to  play  with  after  school  every  day  
And  i  said  to  the  translator, what  did  he  say  
And  i  said, well, tell  him  that  i  am  a  photographer  
I  sort  of  had  this  picture  of  this  incredibly  wonderful, bright  happy, little  child  who  now  appeared  to  be  very  Withdrawn  being  enslaved  by  this  family  
So  i  finally  decided, i  said, look  --  this  is  all  through  the  translator  because  this  is  all, you  know, i  Don't  speak  a  word  of  korean  --  and  i  said, look  I'm, really  glad  that  hyun-sook  has  a  family  to  live  with  
I  Don't  pretend  to  understand  What's  going  on  here.
Well, there  was  an  american  marine  priest  that  i  had  met  in  the  course  of  doing  the  story  who  had  75  children  living  in  his  house.
He  had  kids  from  all  over  korea  living  there, and  he  would  find  families  for  these  kids.
Hyun-sook  stayed  at  father  Keene's  and  her  uncle  agreed  to  let  her  stay  there  until  the  adoption  went  through  
And  then  she  set  up  a  work  detail  list  of  who  cleaned  the  orphanage  on  what  day  
We  went  back  to  our  hotel  room, and  gene  was  showing  natasha  also  where  atlanta  was  .
And  we  fall  asleep  --  and  I've  been  in  this  room, you  know, for  a  couple  of  months  now, 
And  they  always  Overheat  the  hotels  in  korea  terribly  so  during  the  day, i  always  left  the  window  open  
And  i  Don't  speak  korean, but  I'm  hearing  these  voices  and  I'm, not  hearing  anger, I'm, hearing  terror  
I  remember  his  son  had  the  ll  bean  Bootlaces  and  We're  trying  to  do  up  his  laces  
So  we  ran  to  the  bathroom  and  got  towels  and  put  them  over  our  faces  and  the  kids  faces  
Eleven, people  ended  up  dying  in  the  fire  
Five  people  jumped  and  died.
So  it  turned  into  a  Dual  celebration, because  natasha  was  the  first  person  from  this  village  ever  to  go  to  the  united  states.
This  is  saying, goodbye  to  everybody  at  the  orphanage.
And  the  pilot, jeff  Cowley  actually  went  back  and  adopted.
So  at  this  point, natasha  Doesn't  speak  a  word  of  english, other  than  what  little  father  keene  taught  her  
She  learned  english  in  three  months, 
Natasha  told  me  that  a  lot  of  the  kids  thought  she  was  stuck  up  because  they  would  talk  to  her, and  she  Wouldn't  answer, and  they  Didn't  realize  she  Didn't  actually  speak  english  very  well  in  the  beginning.
Now, remember  the  picture  how  much  she  looked  like  her  grandmother  at  the  beginning, 
The  captain  of  the  Cheerleaders  
This  is  her  Half-sister  
Natasha  would  you  just  come  up  for  a  second  just  maybe  to  say, hello  to  everybody  
Natasha  I've  seen  pictures  millions  of  times. But  today  was  the  first  time.
I  started  crying  
The  telescope  is  actually  built  similarly  to  the  well-known  to  you  hubble  space  telescope, except  it  does  have  an  additional  lens  --  a  Wide-field  lens  as  you  would  call  it  as  a  photographer  
The  way  we  do  that  actually  is  with  a  method  which  we  call  the  transit  method.
But  we  learn  a  lot  from  that  not  only  that  there  is  a  planet  there, but  we  also  learn  its  size  
So  what  have  we  learned  
And  we  do  care  about  planets  like  the  earth.
So  today, I'm  here  to  actually  give  you  a  first  glimpse  of  what  the  new  telescope  kepler  has  been  able  to  tell  us  in  the  last  few  weeks.
It's  about  100  million  such  planets, 
So  That's, great, because  then  we  can  go  and  study  them  --  remotely  of  course  --  with  all  the  techniques  that  we  already  have  tested  in  the  past  five  years  
The  one  that  this  step  is  enabling  us  to  do  is  coming  next  
So  the  question  is, is  that  chemical  phenomenon, universal, or  is  it  something  which  depends  on  the  planet?
We  Don't  want  to  go  blind  because  There's  too  many  possibilities, and  there  is  not  too  much  lab. And  there  is  not  enough  human  time  to  actually  to  do  all  the  experiments.
Well, there  are  many  reasons, and  you  heard  some  of  them  in  the  short  talk  today.
And  that  is  going  to  change  our  worldview  in  a  profound  way  --  not  in  a  dissimilar  way  as  400  years  ago, Copernicus'  act  did  by  changing  the  way  we  view  space  and  time  
And  half  the  time  What's  happened  is  It's  related. This  kind  of  sense  of  insignificance  to  humankind  to  the  earth  in  a  bigger  space.
I  mean, look, you  can  see  the  Necktie, but  you  Can't, even  imagine  seeing  the  size  of  a  little  small  atom  
So  what  does  this  tell  us  
There  is  immense  powerful  potential  in  life  in  this  universe  --  especially  now  that  we  know  that  places  like  the  earth  are  common  
Let's  start  this  new  revolution  at  the  tail  end  of  the  old  one  with  synthetic  biology, being  the  way  to  transform  both  our  environment  and  our  future  
These  gapminder  bubbles  show  you  how  the  spread  of  the  virus  was  in  1983  in  the  world, or  how  we  estimate  that  it  was  
Look  india  got  many  infected, but  had  a  low  level  
And  almost  the  same  happens  here.
Now, let  me  make  a  fast  replay  of  botswana.
And  if  people  who  are  infected  are  treated, they  Don't  die  of  aids.
In  spite  of  Pepfar, the  generous  Pepfar, all  people  are  not  reached  by  treatment  and  of  those  who  are  reached  by  treatment  in  the  poor  countries, only  60  percent  are  left  on  treatment  after  two  years.
No  It's, not  look  here.
There's, a  lot  of  things  that  we  thought  that  now  good  research  done  by  african  institutions  and  researchers  together  with  the  international  researchers, show  that  That's  not  the  case  
See  the  difference  within  one  african  country  --  it  goes  from  very  low  level  to  very  high  level. And  most  of  the  provinces  in  kenya  is  quite  modest  .
So, what  is  it  then  
It  could  be  concurrency  
And  we  have  a  terrible  Chlamydia  epidemic  --  terrible  Chlamydia  epidemic, which  sticks  around  for  many  years.
Let's  talk  about  past  and  future, billions  
We  know  that  most  of  that  wealth  was  made  after  the  year  1800  
And  notice, most  of  that  went  to  the  Motherland  to  the  imperial  Metropoles, not  to  their  colonial  possessions.
So  I'm  going  to  translate  this  into  language  that  you  can  understand  
Let  me  very  briefly, tell  you  what  i  mean  by  this  synthesizing, the  work  of  many  economic  historians  in  the  process, 
That  really  was  a  killer  application.
Property  rights  It's, not  the  democracy  folks, It's  having  the  rule  of  law, based  on  private  property  rights  
Very  few  indians  today  wish  that  india  had  gone  down, mahatma  Gandhi's, road, 
Finally, the  work  ethic  
He  was  wrong.
Take  a  look  at  mathematical  attainment, by  15  year-olds  
Now  It's  just  five  times.
And  could  africa  get  that  sequencing  wrong.
One  obvious  implication  of  modern  economic  history  is  that  It's  quite  hard  to  transition  to  democracy  before  You've  established  secure, private  property  rights  
Warning  that  may  not  work  
That's  the  basis  for  the  western  model  of  representative  government  
And  i  think  these  words  really  nail  it.
That's, not  the  way  history  works.
That's  one  of  the  most  profound  insights  to  come  out  of  the  historical  study  of  complex  institutions  like  civilizations, 
What's  your  view  on  that  
Niall  Ferguson, well, i  really  am  not  just  talking  about  the  rise  of  the  east  I'm  talking  about  the  rise  of  the  rest. And  that  includes  south  america.
I  once  asked  one  of  my  colleagues  at  harvard, hey, is  south  america  part  of  the  west  
Spiders  are  not  just  everywhere, but  They're, extremely  diverse  
Spiders  are  also  extremely  old  
Even  fossil  spiders  can  make  silk, as  we  can  see  from  this  impression  of  a  Spinneret  on  this  fossil  spider  
So  this  means  that  both  spiders  and  spider  silk  have  been  around  for  380  million  years.
You  can  see  multiple  fibers  coming  out  of  the  spinnerets  because  each  Spinneret  has  many  Spigots  on  it.
In  an  Orb-web-weaving  spider, you  can  find  seven  types  of  silk  glands. And  what  i  have  depicted  here  in  this  picture  Let's  start  at  the  one  o'clock  position.
So  silk  fibers  vary  in  their  strength, and  also  their  Extensibility  
If  it  Wasn't  able  to  stretch  so  much, then  basically, when  an  insect  hit  the  web, it  would  just  Trampoline  right  off  of  it.
Some  of  them  are  Orb-weaving  spiders, and  some  of  them  are  Non-orb-weaving  spiders  
How  do  groups  get  anything  done  right?
How  do  you  organize  a  group  of  individuals? So  that  the  output  of  the  group  is  something  coherent  and  of  lasting  value.
And  a  coordination  cost  is  essentially  all  of  the  financial  or  institutional  difficulties  in  Arranging  group  output.
More  recently, because  the  cost  of  letting  groups  communicate  with  each  other  has  fallen  through  the  floor  --  and  communication  costs  are  one  of  the  big  inputs  to  coordination  --  there  has  been  a  second  answer, which  is  to  put  the  cooperation  into  the  infrastructure  to  design  systems  that  coordinate  the  output  of  the  group  as  a  By-product  of  the  operating  of  the  system. Without  regard  to  institutional  models.
And  what  i  want  to  call  your  attention  to  is  not  the  mermaid  parade  itself  charming, though  it  is, but  rather  to  these  photos, 
First  of  all, when  you  form  an  institution, you  take  on  a  management  problem, right?
You  have  to  have  legal  structure, 
Third  forming, an  institution  is  inherently  Exclusionary  
You  Can't  hire  everyone  in  a  company, right?
When  you  build  cooperation  into  the  infrastructure, which  is  the  flickr  answer, you  can  leave  the  people  where  they  are. And  you  take  the  problem  to  the  individuals, rather  than  moving  the  individuals  to  the  problem.
In  bigger  systems, the  head  gets  bigger  and  the  tail  gets  longer.
If  you  go  down  to  five  percent  You're, still  accounting  for  60  percent  of  the  photos  
We've  looked  at  Who's  contributed  to  linux, and  most  of  the  patches  have  been  produced  by  programmers. Who've  only  done  one  thing, right? .
Do  you  want  that  patch  right?
Meetup  a  service  founded, so  that  users  could  find  people  in  their  local  area  who  share  their  interests  and  Affinities  and  actually  have  a  real-world  meeting  Offline  in  a  cafe  or  a  pub, or  what  have  you  
Stay-at-home  moms  right  
It  is  a  One-button  operation  that  you  can  do  for  free  
And  the  answer  to  that  question, is  it  Doesn't  matter  because  That's, not  the  right  question? ?
And  if  there  is  an  answer  to  that  that  happens  outside  the  professional  framework  of  journalism, it  makes  no  sense  to  take  a  professional  metaphor  and  apply  it  to  this  distributed  class.
They  trade  tips  like  if  you  feel  like  eating  something  clean  a  toilet  or  the  litter  box, the  feeling  will  pass  
We  have  an  attitude  that  support  groups  are  inherently  beneficial  
Now  when  the  larger  group  is  a  bunch  of  Drunks  and  the  small  group  wants  to  stay  sober, then  we  think  That's  a  great  support  group.
But  when  the  small  group  is  teenage  girls  who  want  to  stay  anorexic  by  choice, then  We're  horrified  
Flavor  is  king, flavor  rules, 
So  this  is  the  challenge  for  this  bread  
And  this  is  what  every  student  has  to  begin  with  
Everyone  who  works  in  the  culinary  world  knows  that  the  first  stage  of  cooking  is  Mise  en  place, which  is  just  a  french  way  of  saying, get  organized  
Everything  in  its  place, first  stage  
Stage  two  is  mixing, we  take  the  ingredients  and  we  mix  them  
And  so  we  in  the  mixing  process  have  to  develop  the  gluten, we  have  to  activate  the  leaven  or  the  yeast, and  we  have  to  essentially  distribute  all  the  ingredients  evenly  
And  at  stage  nine, we  get  the  dough  to  the  final  shape, and  it  goes  into  the  oven  --  stage  10, 
And  the  Starches, when  they  reach  about  180  degrees  Gelatinize  
And  stage  11, we  call  it  cooling  --  because  we  never  really  eat  the  bread  right  away.
And  we  save  some  of  those  for  the  next  generation.
So  we  turn  it  into  flour.
Not  like  hot  water  made  cold  or  cold  water, turned  hot, but  water  Boiled  off  and  becoming  steam  
So  We've  got  now  this  flour  
And  what  do  we  do?
Or  another  analogy  would  be  a  Caterpillar  has  been  turned  into  a  butterfly  
But  We've  got  this  bread. And  what  i  did  here  is  to  try  to  again, evoke  even  more  flavor  from  this  grain  was  We've  added  into  it.
And  so  this  is, again, hopefully  not  only  a  healthy  bread, but  a  bread  that  you  will  enjoy  
So  if  i  kind  of  break  this  bread, maybe  we  can  share  this.
We'll  start  a  little  piece  here  and  I'm  going  to  take  a  little  piece  here  --  i  think  I'd  better  taste  it  myself  before  you  have  it  at  lunch  
Let  me  give  you  just  one  example  of  this  
Now, the  question  is, how  could  we  ask  them  
But  half  the  time  what  she  would  do  is  take  a  little  bit  of  the  broccoli  and  go  Mmmmm. Broccoli.
So  She'd  act  as  if  what  she  wanted  was  just  the  opposite  of  what  the  babies  wanted  
The  question  you  might  ask, though  is, why  do  children  learn  so  much  
Well, what  kind  of  explanation  could  we  have  for  this  
And  essentially  what  bayes  did  was  to  provide  a  mathematical  way, using  probability  theory  to  characterize  describe  the  way  that  scientists  find  out  about  the  world  
And  some  10  years  ago, i  suggested  that  babies  might  be  doing  the  same  thing.
Because  if  you  wave  a  block  over  the  top  of  the  detector, something  you  Wouldn't  ever  think  of  to  begin  with  the  detector  will  actually  activate  two  out  of  three  times  
Now, there  are  two  things  that  are  really  interesting  about  this  
The  first  one  is, again, remember, these  are  four  year-olds  
They're  just  learning  how  to  count  
And  There's  been  a  bunch  of  interesting  studies  recently  that  have  shown  this  playing  around  is  really  a  kind  of  experimental  research  program.
I  Don't  know, 
Not  working  either  
I  think  babies  and  children  are  actually  more  conscious  than  we  are  as  adults  
It's  good  to  be  a  grownup  
That  technology  is  simulating  humans.
And  what  you  can  see  is  --  it  is  actually  a  very  good  game.
I've  made  him  run  into  a  wall  here  over  and  over  again, 
So  we  simulated  that  as  well, and  then  the  really  tricky  bit  is  to  teach  that  network  how  to  walk  
We  heard  about  those  already  yesterday, and  i  suppose  that  most  of  you  are  familiar  with  that  already  
Those  are  then  selected  by  the  algorithm  Reproduced  with  mutation  and  Recombinations  to  introduce  sex  as  well  
Now, this  might  look  kind  of  trivial, but  It's  actually  very  important.
So  That's, what  you  see  here  
We  just  took  this  character  that  i  just  talked  about, put  it  on  a  slippery  surface. And  this  is  what  you  get  out  of  it.
So  that  you  Don't  have  a  character  that  looks  limp, but  actually  a  character  that  you  can  use  in  an  action  film  straight  away  that  looks  kind  of  alive  in  midair  as  well  
That's  one  angle, Here's, another  angle, ,
So  this  is  exactly  the  same  behavior  that  you  saw, but  in  a  slightly  better, rendered  version  
This  is  incredibly  quick. This  is  happening  in  real  time.
This  is  another  behavior.
You  feel  kind  of  sorry  for  the  guy.
It's  even  worse  --  and  that  is  another  video: i  just  got  last  night  --  if  you  render  that  a  bit  more  Realistically  
Yes, you  can  just  about  see  it  here.
Now, We've  just  tried  and  --  looked  at  our  character  and  asked  ourselves, can  we  do  that  ourselves  as  well?
This  was  an  ai  contour  that  was  produced  and  evolved  --  Half-evolved, i  should  say  --  to  produce  balance, basically, 
So  that  all  happened  automatically  we  Didn't  put  that  in  there  
Thanks  
You  can  draw  as  everyone  should  
Shake  it  and  you  have  a  heterosexual  couple  
You  know, I'm  making  a  very  important  argument.
I'm  making  an  argument  that  art  and  creativity  are  very  essential  tools  in  empathy.
Say, your  motorcycle  crashes  
Ok, when  i  was  offered  the  times  column  six  years  ago, the  deal  was  like  this  You'll  be  sent  the  coolest  hottest  Slickest, new  gadgets, 
Every  week, It'll  arrive  at  your  door, 
The  job  though  came  with  one  small  downside, and  that  is  they  intended  to  publish  my  email  address  at  the  end  of  every  column  
The  guy  had  a  duplicate  headset  for  me  to  listen  to  
Some  of  the  stories  are  just  so  classic.
And  the  Technician's, like  ma'am, You've  got  the  mouse  up  against  the  screen.
And  We've  arrived  at  the  age  of  interface, Matrices, where  there  are  so  many  features  and  options  you  have  to  do  two  dimensions. You  know, a  vertical  and  a  horizontal.
It's, not  like  the  rest  of  the  screen  is  so  full  of  other  components  that  you  need  to  collapse.
So  there  is  a  limit  that  we  Don't  want  to  cross. So  what  is  the  answer  ?
I'm, sorry, It's, not  one  yet, 
You  have  to  scroll  like  seven  Screens-full  to  get  to  it  
It's  like  a  747  shuttle, cockpit, 
You  do  not  
We've  entered  planet  domination  mode, 
They're  dying  to  throw  the  whole  thing  out  and  start  fresh, but  they  Can't  They're  locked  in  because  so  many  Add-ons  and  other  company  stuff  locks  into  the  old  1982  Chassis  
I  liked  the  media  center  pc.
The  lesson  was, simplicity  sells  
Here's, another  example, chris  You're  the  source  of  all  power  
In  my  very  last  example  --  i  do  a  lot  of  my  work  using  speech  recognition  software, and  you  have  to  be  kind  of  quiet  because  the  software  is  nervous  
I  also  use  this  feature  called  voice  Macros  period: 
Correct  Dissuade, not  just  
No  new  features  It's  never  happened  before  in  software  
It  could  be  the  design  of  the  thing  You're  using  
But  i  also  in  looking  at  more  powerful  technologies  and  nanotechnology  and  genetic  engineering  and  other  new  emerging  kind  of  digital  technologies  became  very  concerned  about  the  potential  for  abuse  
And  we  Can't  fight  the  threat  in  the  kind  of  stupid  way  We're  doing  because  a  million-dollar  act  causes  a  billion  dollars  of  damage  causes  a  trillion  dollar  response, which  is  largely  ineffective. And  arguably  probably  almost  certainly  has  made  the  problem  worse.
So  after  giving  up  on  the  book  --  and  i  had  the  great  honor  to  be  able  to  join  Kleiner  Perkins  about  a  year  ago  and  to  work  through  venture  capital  on  the  innovative  side, and  to  try  to  find  some  innovations  that  could  address  what  i  saw  as  some  of  these  big  problems.
Things  where  you  know  a  factor  of  10  difference  can  make  a  factor  of  1000  difference  in  the  outcome.
The  first  is  this  whole  area  of  education, and  it  really  relates  to  what  nicholas  was  talking  about  with  a  $100  computer  
I  think  the  challenge  for  us  is  --  I'm, very  certain  that  that  will  happen. The  challenge  is, will  we  develop  the  kind  of  educational  tools  and  things  with  the  net  to  let  us  take  advantage  of  that  device?
I'd  argue  today  that  we  have  incredibly  powerful  computers, but  we  Don't  have  very  good  software  for  them.
So  given  that  we  know  and  should  believe  --  because  Moore's  Law's  been  like  a  constant, i  mean, It's  just  been  very  predictable  progress  over  the  last  40  years, or  whatever  
We  have  a  challenge  because  the  urban  population  is  growing  in  this  century, from  two  billion  to  six  billion  in  a  very  short  amount  of  time, people  are  moving  to  the  cities.
And  these  are  the  kinds  of  things  We're  going  to  discover  as  we  start  to  engineer  at  the  nano  scale.
We  believe  that  Genentech  the  Compaq, the  lotus  the  sun, the  netscape, the  amazon, the  google  in  these  fields  are  yet  to  be  found  because  this  materials  revolution  will  drive  these  things  forward.
And  to  give  you  an  idea  of  the  last  fund  that  Kleiner  raised  was  a  $400  million  fund. So  this  for  us  is  a  very  substantial  fund.
And  what  we  did  over  the  last  few  months  --  well, a  few  months  ago, ray  kurzweil.
You  normally  get  a  Trivalent  vaccine  against  three  possible  strains, 
We  believe  that  if  we  could  fill  these  10  gaps, we  have  a  chance  to  help  really  reduce  the  risk  of  a  pandemic  .
So  We're  very  excited, because  we  think  we  can  fund  10  or  speed  up  10  projects  and  see  them  come  to  market  in  the  next  couple  years  that  will  address  this  
But  above  all, what  we  have  to  do  is  we  have  to  help  the  good  guys, the  people  on  the  defensive  side  have  an  advantage  over  the  people  who  want  to  abuse  things.
Many  of  them  are  trying  to  kill  us  from  the  minute. We  go  into  them, but  nevertheless, They're, absolutely  gripping  and  contain  unbelievable  biological  wonders  that  are  very, very  different  from  those  that  we  have  on  the  planet.
Apart  from  the  intrinsic  value  of  the  biology  and  Mineralogy  and  Geo-microbiology  that  we  do  there  We're  also  using  these  as  Templates  for  figuring  out  how  to  go  look  for  life  on  other  planets, 
Particularly  mars, but  also  europa  the  small, icy  moon  around  jupiter, 
We're  getting  ready  to  begin  to  go  through  the  process  of  leaving  our  planet  of  origin  and  out  into  the  wider  solar  system, and  beyond  
I  think  myself  that  life  is  a  natural  outgrowth  of  the  increasing  Complexification  of  matter  over  time.
It's  going  to  be  everywhere  we  look  --  where  there  are  planetary  systems  that  can  possibly  support  it  
So  this  is  a  very  bold  statement.
How  do  you  know  it  when  you  find  it  
Very  critically, how  do  we  protect  it  if  we  find  it  and  not  contaminate  it  
If  i  were  to  take  a  Swab  off  your  teeth  and  plate  it  on  a  petri  plate  within  about  four  or  five  hours, i  would  have  to  see  growth  
So  they  are  intrinsically  a  slower  Life-form  
It's  a  very  simple  trick, and  i  never  fail  to  do  it  when  I'm  sitting  in  a  window  seat  
This  is  regularly  several  hundred  parts  per  million  
And  these  are  mineral  deposits  that  are  also  made  by  bacteria  
And  so  one  can  send  a  thousand  of  them  as  you  can  see  in  this  upper  left-hand  picture, a  thousand  of  them  could  fit  into  the  payload  bay  that  was  used  for  one  of  the  current  Mer  rovers, 
The  question  as  to  whether  there  is  life  on  mars, that  is  related  to  life  on  earth  has  now  been  very  Muddied, because  we  now  know  from  mars  Meteorites  that  have  made  it  to  earth  that  There's  material  that  can  be  Exchanged  between  those  two  planets.
One  of  the  burning  questions, of  course, is, if  we  go  there  and  find  life  in  the  sub-surface, as  i  fully  expect  that  we  will  is  that  a  second  genesis  of  life  
Did  it  start  there  and  get  transported  here  
This  will  be  a  fascinating  puzzle, as  we  go  into  the  next  half-century, and  where  i  expect  that  we  will  have  more  and  more  mars  missions  to  answer  these  questions, 
For  real  --  you  can  take  a  second  You've  got  to  feel  this  to  learn  it  
Well, you  could  resist  the  temptation  to  announce  your  goal, 
He  Wouldn't  reveal  the  exact  number  of  bottles.
And  he  ended  up  spending  over  a  million  dollars  and  hiring  Ex-fbi  and  Ex-scotland  yard  agents  to  try  to  get  to  the  bottom  of  this  
There  are  very  few  places  in  the  us  where  you  can  try  real  Kobe.
It  was  like  160  dollars  for  this  
And  then  i  was  left  with  these  little  ugly  flakes  on  my  pasta  that  you  know  their  purpose  had  been  served.
This  is  soap, That's  made  from  silver  nanoparticles, which  have  Antibacterial  properties.
And  it, you  know, Tickled  a  little  bit  and  it  smelled  good. But  i  have  to  say  that  nobody  here  has  complimented  me  on  the  cleanliness  of  my  face  today.
These  ones  Gq  did  spring  for  --  i  own  these  --  but  i  will  tell  you  not  only  did  i  not  get  a  compliment  from  any  of  you.
And  then  an  enzyme  in  its  digestive  tract  leeches  into  the  beans  and  people  with  the  Unenviable  job  of  collecting  these  Cats'  Leavings, then  go  through  the  forest, collecting  the  you  know, results  and  processing  it  into  coffee  --  although  you  actually  can  buy  it  in  the  Unprocessed  form.
But  anyway, we  had  a  great  Night's  sleep.
And  you  spend  a  third  of  your  life  in  bed  
This  is  tom  cruise, arriving  at  the  mission.
When  he  tries  to  open  the  door, you  could  call  it  mission.
There  was  one  object  that  i  could  not  get  my  hands  on. And  that  was  the  1947  cheval  blanc.
And  it  was  an  invitation.
Earlier  this  year, a  virtual  asteroid  in  it  sold  for  330000, real  dollars  
And  this  is  a  titan  class  ship  in  the  space  game.
It  gives  you  great  powers.
Your  ambition  is  satisfied, but  It's  very  beautiful  
And  so  these  combine  to  form  a  very  intense  emotional  engagement, 
But  this  Isn't, the  really  interesting  stuff  
The  really  interesting  stuff  about  virtuality  is  what  you  can  measure  with  it.
The  Game's  just  trying  to  get  people  to  open  about  a  million  boxes  getting  better  and  better  stuff  in  them.
This  sounds  immensely  boring, but  games  are  able  to  make  this  process  incredibly  compelling  
But  we  Don't  just  have  pies  in  the  boxes.
And  also  we  say, well, how  many  monsters  should  i  have  the  entire  world  full  of  a  billion  monsters  
They're, not  rational  about  probability  
It's, not  giving  me  my  last  two  pies, I'm  going  to  give  up  
And  the  point  is  really  that  we  evolved  to  be  satisfied  by  the  world  in  particular  ways.
So  you  give  people  lots  and  lots  of  different  tasks.
Third, you  reward  effort  
And  something  very  exciting  is  just  beginning  to  happen  in  places  like  the  university  of  bristol  in  the  uk, where  we  are  beginning  to  be  able  to  model  mathematically  dopamine  levels  in  the  brain.
And  the  success  rate  is  at  close  to  100  percent.
Let's  start  with  business  
But  each  bag  We'd  sell  would  provide  a  Year's  worth  of  school  meals  for  one  kid.
All  this  time, You're  --  when  you  think  about  hunger, It's, a  hard  thing  to  think  about  because  what  we  think  about  is  eating  
There's, definitely  hunger  in  america, 49  million  people  and  almost  167  million  children  
Hunger, definitely  means  something  a  little  bit  different  in  america  than  it  does  internationally, but  It's  incredibly  important  to  address  hunger  in  our  own  country.
Well, They're  both  about  food  
And  you  know, the  reality  is  that  between  farmers  in  america, who  actually  quite, frankly, when  i  spend  time  in  the  midwest  are  pretty  large  in  general  ,
So  the  problematic  food  system  is  affecting  both  hunger  and  obesity  
Not  to  beat  a  dead  horse. But  this  is  a  global  food  system  where  There's  a  billion  people  hungry  and  billion  people.
And  how  are  we  going  to  get  those  kids?
Another  thing  That's  become  incredibly  global  is  production  of  meat  and  fish.
And  we  were  going  to  do  something  that  was  horrible  for  the  profession  
And  that  the  incredible  amount  of  effort  to  deliver  those  sketches  for  years  and  years  and  years  is  not  only  something  to  be  Derided, but  we  would  merely  write  it  off  as  merely  execution.
Now, there  are  all  kinds  of  things  that  we  architects  need  to  learn  how  to  do  like  managing  contracts  learning  how  to  write  contracts, understanding  Procurement  processes, understanding  the  time  value  of  money  and  cost  estimation.
Take  joint  positions  with  your  client, 
Why  was  this  horrible  little  building  so  important  to  their  Renown  and  their  innovation  
Because  they  could  do  whatever  they  wanted  to  to  this  building  
The  architectural  manifestation  was, frankly, just  dumb  
In  fact, it  really  was  the  clients  who  had  to  do  it.
They  had  to  make  a  decision  based  on  the  positions.
Now  that  theater  machine  has  ability  to  move  between  a  whole  series  of  configurations  at  the  push  of  a  button  and  a  few  Stagehands  in  a  short  amount  of  time, 
But  it  also  has  the  potential  to  not  only  provide  Multiform, but  Multi-processional  sequences  
And  some  of  the  seats  need  to  actually  change  their  direction  and  change  their  rake  to  allow  that  to  happen.
There, you  see  It's  the  side  balconies  for  the  proscenium.
Meaning, nothing  that  we  do, can  we  be  the  first  ones  to  do  it?
Now, if  I'll  take  you  through  --  this  is  an  early  concept  sketch  --  take  you  through  kind  of  a  mixture  of  all  these  things  together.
You  would  be  allowed  to  bring  objects  or  performers  into  the  performing  chamber  aida  their  elephants.
Et, voila?
This  is  the  At&ampt  performing  arts, Center's  dee  and  charles  wyly.
But  we  got  to  that  conclusion  without  understanding  where  we  were  going, what  we  knew  were  a  series  of  issues  that  the  company  and  the  client  was  confronted  with  
So  this  is  a  picture  of  me  holding  one  of  the  first  watercolor  paintings  i  ever  made  
I  have  many  of  these  books  and  I've  been  keeping  them  for  about  the  last  eight  or  nine  years.
And  i  really  loved  this  idea  of  the  partial  glimpse  into  Somebody's  life.
As  opposed  to  knowing  the  whole  story, just  knowing  a  little  bit  of  the  story, and  then  letting  your  own  mind, fill  in  the  rest  
This  is  a  project  that  scans  the  World's  newly  posted  blog  entries  every  two  or  three  minutes, searching  for  occurrences  of  the  phrases  i  feel, and  i  am  feeling. And  when  it  finds  one  of  those  phrases, it  grabs  the  full  sentence  up  to  the  period  and  also  tries  to  identify  demographic  information  about  the  author.
And  when  that  happens, these  Montage  compositions  are  automatically  created  which  consist  of  the  sentence  and  images  being  combined  
I'm  23  and  a  recovering  Meth  and  heroin  addict  and  feel  absolutely  blessed  to  still  be  alive.
I  feel  Sassy  
As  you  can  see, we  feel  fine  collects  very, very  small-scale  personal  stories.
So  really  even  challenging  the  notion  of  what  can  be  considered  a  story  
And  the  Eskimo  community  basically  camps  out  on  the  edge  of  the  ice  here, waits  for  a  whale  to  come  close  enough  to  attack.
They  have  colors, what  do  they  look  like?
This  is  in  the  Patkotak's  family, living  room  in  their  house  in  Barrow, the  Boxed  wine.
Cigarette  break  outside  --  i  Don't  smoke  
So  you  have  some  really  happy  person  holding  10  balloons, and  some  really  sad  soul  holding  one  balloon  
A  16-year-old  student  
I  asked  her  about  that, and  she  said, she  meant  that  she  Doesn't  want  to  be  married  because  in  her  opinion, when  you  get  married  in  bhutan  as  a  woman, your  chances  to  live  an  independent  life  kind  of  end. And  so  she  had  no  interest  in  that  .
A  37-year-old  road  worker  
His  wish  was  to  make  some  money  and  open  a  store  
Finally, this  is  a  26-year-old  nun.
I  asked  her  a  little  bit  more  about  the  cave  and  what  she  planned  would  happen.
Jonathan  harris, maybe  You'll  die.
Yeah, but  --  yeah, ok, do  you  hope  --  would  you  prefer  to  live  in  the  cave  for  40  years  or  to  live  for  one  year?
Woman, yes, from  then  I'm  going  to  the  heaven  
You  can  start  to  see  some  familiar  balloons  here.
Thank  you  
So  the  approach  that  we  took  was  the  other  way  around  
What  you  see  here  is  a  Prototypic  device.
It's  made  of  paper  and  paper. Of  course, wicks  fluid  as  you  know, paper  cloth  --  drop  wine  on  the  tablecloth. And  the  wine  wicks  all  over  everything.
So  the  production  capability  is  there  
And  the  procedure  that  we  have  is  simply  to  start  with  paper  
You  Can't  manipulate  it  very  well, although  I'll  show  something  about  that  in  a  moment, 
So  you  take  the  drop  of  blood, no  further  Manipulations, you  put  it  on  a  little  device, the  device  filters  out  the  blood  cells  lets  the  serum  go  through, and  you  get  a  series  of  colors  down  in  the  bottom.
Turns  out  to  work  actually  quite  well, particularly  when  your  color  printer  has  printed  the  color  bars  that  indicate  how  things  work  
I  Don't  know  whether  the  idea  of  one  computer  one  child  makes  any  sense, Here's  the  computer  of  the  future.
The  answer  is  that  what  you  do  and  the  details  are  not  terribly  important. Here  is  to  make  something  more  elaborate. You  take  several  different  layers  of  paper, each  one  containing  its  own  little  fluid  system, and  you  separate  them  by  pieces  of  literally  Double-sided  carpet  tape. The  stuff  you  use  to  stick  the  carpets  onto  the  floor.
But  that  is, in  principle, the  way  you  solve  the  fever  of  unexplained  origin  problem. Because  each  one  of  those  spots  then  becomes  a  test  for  a  particular  set  of  markers  of  disease.
Now, i  have  one  last  two  last  little  stories  to  tell  you  in  finishing  off  this  business.
We  were  very  proud  of  this, particularly  the  title, which  was  Eggbeater  as  centrifuge  
We  all  struggled  for  an  entire  day  to  think  about  simplicity  
Why  are  we  spending  $135  billion  
In  the  fourth  act  with  our  hubris, our  overconfidence  developing, we  invaded  iraq  and  afghanistan.
When  i  walked  across  afghanistan  in  the  winter  of  2001-2002, what  i  saw  was  scenes, like  this  
In  Sangin  where  i  was  sick  in  2002, the  nearest  health  clinic  was  within  three  days.
And  the  same  is  true  for  the  troops  
And  the  reason  I'm  looking  a  little  bit  perplexed  in  this  photograph  is  i  was  somewhat  frightened. And  i  was  too  afraid. On  this  occasion  to  ask  him  having  run  for  an  hour  through  the  desert  and  taken  refuge  in  this  house, why  he  had  turned  up  and  wanted  to  have  his  photograph  taken  with  me.
Now, this  is  not  to  say, afghanistan  is  a  place  full  of  people  like  mullah  mustafa, 
I  ran  a  center  at  harvard  from  2008  to  2010.
You  feel  deep  deep  guilt, 
The  average  british  soldier  is  on  a  tour  of  only  six  months, italian  soldiers  on  tours  of  four  months, the  american  military  on  tours  of  12  months  
So  we  need  to  change  that  institutional  culture, 
Secondly, we  need  to  aim  off  of  the  optimism  of  the  generals  
Borders  between  the  Bosniak  territory, and  the  Bosnian-serb  territory  have  calmed  down  
If  what  We're  interested  in  is  regional  stability, egypt  is  far  more  important  
Just  briefly  What's, your  take  on  the  current  events  there  and  the  intervention  
What  we  should  have  done  in  libya  is, we  should  have  stuck  to  the  Un  resolution.
For  the  first  time  in  the  united  states, a  predominantly  white  group  of  voters  voted  for  an  african-american  candidate  for  president  
But  really  the  question  here  --  obama  did  relatively  well  in  kansas, 
Actually  we  Didn't  ask  them, but  when  they  conducted  exit  polls  in  every  state  in  37  states  out  of  the  50, they  asked  a  question  that  was  pretty  direct  about  race.
And  they  ask  a  series  of  really  interesting  questions  
But  you  see  democrats  versus  republican, not  a  big  difference  based  on  who  your  neighbors  are  
And  likewise, they  asked  not  in  2000, but  in  the  same  survey  in  1996, would  you  not  vote  for  a  qualified? Black?
I'm, a  big  fan  of  cities  
And  it  was  followed  a  year  or  two  later  by  Laennec  discovering  the  stethoscope  
It's  been  on  calendars, postage  stamps, in  many  different  countries.
I  call  it  the  Ipatient  
They  understood  her  breast  cancer  at  the  molecular  level, they  had  no  need  to  touch  her  breasts.
But  to  her, it  mattered  deeply  
We  marry, for  example, with  great  Pomp  and  ceremony  and  expense  to  signal  our  departure  from  a  life  of  solitude  and  misery  and  loneliness  to  one  of  eternal  bliss.
I  would  feel  the  abdomen  
I  remember  so  many  huge  hollowed  out  haunted  eyes, staring  up  at  me  as  i  performed  this  ritual  
It  was  an  offering  an  invitation  
It's  the  --  It's  produced  by  the  quadro  corporation  of  west  virginia, 
You  could  Dowse  for  all  sorts  of  things.
So  the  way  it  works  is  you  go  down  the  hallway, and  you  see  if  it  tilts  toward  a  particular  locker, and  then  you  open  the  locker  
No  it  --  well, it  has  kind  of  a  Right-leaning  bias  
You  can  say, a  miracle  occurs  
Whereas  --  and  It's  true  scientists, sometimes  throw  terms  out  as  linguistic  place, Fillers  --  dark  energy, or  dark  matter, or  something  like  that  --  until  we  figure  out  what  it  is. We'll  just  call  it  this  --  It's  the  beginning  of  the  causal  chain  for  science.
You  Don't  even  need  photoshop. You  Don't  need  high-tech  equipment. You  Don't  need  computers.
In  the  case  of  galileo, he  had  two  problems  when  he  turned  his  telescope  to  saturn  
And  this  is  what  he  ended  up  concluding  that  he  saw  
So  without  a  theory  of  planetary  rings  and  with  only  grainy  data, you  Can't  have  a  good  theory.
And  it  Wasn't  solved  until  1655  
And  so  You're  reducing  the  quality  of  your  data  
Virgin  mary  in  Clearwater, florida, 
Here's  the  virgin  mary  on  the  backside, which  they  started  to  wipe  off  
And  in  england, There's  a  pop  singer, 
In  america, it  would  be  We're  6000  light  years  from  the  edge.
And  so  if  we  can  do  that, then  we  can  free  up  resources  for  buying  drugs  that  you  really  do  need  for  treating  aids  and  hiv  and  malaria  and  for  preventing  avian  flu.
That  is  the  primary  function  of  an  incubator  
And  then  we  thought  of  the  most  simple  solution  we  could  to  address  this  problem.
He  connected  with  people  who  cared  about  this  Nonprofessionals  people  with  passion  
Henry  ford  comes  up  with  a  really  cool  idea.
It  enables  him  to  hire  men  who  used  to  get  paid  50  cents  a  day  and  pay  them  five  dollars  a  day.
And  you  can  build  an  entire  industry  on  that  
You  know, the  pirate  tribe  is  a  fascinating.
So  when  al  gore  set  out  to  change  the  world  again, he  Didn't  do  it  by  himself.
What  kevin  kelley  has  taught  us  is  you  just  need, i  Don't  know  a  thousand  true  fans  --  a  thousand  people  who  care  enough  that  they  will  get  you  the  next  round. And  the  next  round.
The  beatles  did  not  invent  teenagers  
She  Didn't  invent  the  idea  of  caring  about  this  issue.
I  see  what  the  status  quo  is  i  Don't  like  it  
Someone  stands  up  and  says, this  one  is  important  
Because  if  You're  not  upsetting  anyone  You're  not  changing  the  status  quo  
Because  focusing  on  that  part  of  it  --  not  the  mechanics  of  what  You're  building, but  the  who  and  the  leading  part  --  is  where  change  comes  
So  here  is  what  leaders  have  in  common.
The  second  thing  is, they  build  a  culture  
Thank  you  very  much.
They  have  different  interests.
They  were  created  by  a  Kuwaiti  psychologist  called  Naif  al  Mutawa  
Now, the  99  is  not  just  a  comic  book.
It's  now, a  theme  park, 
Now  while  4shbab  and  the  99  may  look  new  and  shiny, there  is  actually  a  very  long  tradition  of  this  
And  to  my  mind, those  are  pretty  wise  words, no  matter  what  your  creed. Thank  you.
This  is  Tootsie's  orchid  lounge  in  nashville,

Now, There's  venues  like  this, a  discotheque  and  There's  Jukeboxes  in  bars  where  you  Don't  even  need  to  have  a  band  
And  as  with  jazz  the  dancers  liked  certain  sections  more  than  they  did. Others.
So  that  Doesn't  really  work  
And  it  turns  out  that  a  sound  like  this  is  the  most  energy  efficient  and  practical  way  to  transmit  their  call  across  the  fields  and  Savannahs  
It's, adaptive  
And  I'm  saying, well, the  Passion's  still  there.
We  sing  
And  like  the  birds, the  joy  is  still  there, even  though  we  have  changed  what  we  do  to  fit  the  context,

Pascal  has  been  called  the  architect  of  modern  civilization.

Several  years  ago, a  few  friends  of  mine  decided  we  needed  to  bridge  the  disconnect  between  our  generation  and  the  generation  of  young  women,

This  is  the  dream  of  the  african  girl: 
But  sadly, the  vision  of  a  great  future  or  the  dream  of  a  great  future  is  just  a  dream  because  you  have  all  of  these  Vices  
This  is  a  real  rural  village  
Now, that  was  the  advice  that  st  benedict  gave  his  rather  startled  followers  in  the  fifth  century.
Up  until  that  moment, i  had  been  that  classic  corporate  warrior  --  i  was  eating  too  much. I   was  drinking  too  much.
Now, the  first  step  in  solving  any  problem  is  Acknowledging, the  reality  of  the  situation  You're  in  
It's  in  their  nature, It's  in  their  dna  It's, what  they  do  --  even  the  good  well-intentioned  companies

One  out  of  four  south  bronx, children  has  asthma  
Residents  were  often  given  less  than  a  Month's.
The  common  perception  was  that  only  Pimps  and  Pushers  and  prostitutes  were  from  the  south  bronx  
And  luckily, for  me  that  home  and  the  love  inside  of  it  along  with  help  from  teachers  mentors  and  friends, along  the  way  was  enough  
Are  these  factors  taken  into  consideration.
Once  we  realized  that  we  decided  it  was  time  to  do  our  own  planning.
Anyway, i  know  chris  told  us  not  to  do  pitches  up  here.
Anyway  --  ok, katrina  prior  to  katrina. The  south  bronx  and  new  Orleans'  ninth  ward  had  a  lot  in  common.
In  the  Post-katrina  era  we  have  still  more  in  common  
Neither  the  destruction  of  the  ninth  ward, nor  the  south  bronx  was  inevitable  
At  present  That's, not  happening  in  new  york  city, 
And  although  less  than  25  percent  of  south  bronx  residents  own  cars, these  projects  include  thousands  of  new  parking  spaces  yet, zip  in  terms  of  mass  public  transit

He  looked  at  the  demographics  
His  administration  Narrowed: key: municipal, Thoroughfares  from  five  lanes  to  three  outlawed  parking  on  those  streets  expanded  pedestrian  Walkways  and  bike  lanes  created  public  Plazas  created  one  of  the  most  efficient  bus  Mass-transit  systems  in  the  entire  world.

This  is  more  or  less  what  we  saw  last  year. And  this  is  how  it  will  go  on  into  the  future.
Because  you  see  now  i  presented  statistics  that  Don't  exist  
And  this  is  gdp  per  capita  on  this  axis, 
The  last  century, 1870  was  bad  for  the  kids  in  europe.

We  can  also  make  the  color  here  represent  the  variable  --  and  what  am  i  choosing  here?
And  there  we  are  2001  
The  world  is  quite  a  messy  place.
This  is  two  to  five  dollars.
I  Lectured  on  this  for  ikea, and  they  wanted  to  see  the  sofa  immediately.
I  would  say  that  sub-saharan  africa  has  done  best  in  the  world  during  the  last  50  years.
And  That's  good, it  gets  two  Plusses  
Environment  is  very, very  crucial  
Of  course, It's  human  rights  
And  culture  culture  is  the  most  important  thing.
Even  african  countries  can  achieve  this  
It's  a  cultural  expression  that  for  thousands  of  years  has  inspired  human  beings  to  think  beyond  the  obvious  
And  so  cars  as  art, brings  it  into  an  emotional  plane  --  if  you  accept  that  --  that  you  have  to  deal  with  on  the  same  level, you  would  with  art  with  a  capital, a  
Now  at  this  point  You're  going  to  see  a  picture  of  michelangelo  
Automobiles  are  self-moving  things, right?
Cars  are  a  sculpture  --  did  you  know  this  
Ok, It's, not  marketing  There's, a  very  interesting  car  concept  here, but  the  marketing  part  is  not  what  i  want  to  talk  about  here.
It's  that  will  to  live  that  need  to  survive  to  express  itself  that  comes  in  a  car  and  takes  over  people  like  me, 
And  we  tell  other  people  do  this  do  this  do  this  until  this  thing  comes  alive, 
We  are  completely  infected  and  beauty  can  be  the  result  of  this  Infectiousness  It's  quite  wonderful  
Now  now, i  get  to  the  point  i  want  to  talk  about  cars  as  art  
We're, not  trying  to  find  vanity  and  beauty  
And  that  sometimes  leads  to  bit  of  a  divergence  in  why  We're  doing  what  We're  doing  
Toothbrush, cool  
I  heard  today  about  Joseph's  death  genes  that  have  to  go  in  and  kill  cell  reproduction  
This  is  very  difficult, and  you  have  to  have  a  bond  with  your  team  that  permits  you  to  do  this  because  their  life  is  wrapped  up  in  that  too  
This  is  1996, we  did  this  project.
And  a  group  of  engineers  worked  in  germany, and  the  idea  was, they  would  work  separately  on  this  problem  of  What's, the  successor  to  the  suv  
They  would  come  together, compare  notes, then  they  would  work  apart  come  together. And  they  would  produce  together  a  monumental  set  of  diverse  opinions  that  Didn't  pollute, each  Other's  ideas  --  but  at  the  same  time  came  together  and  resolved  the  problems.
The  bathroom  was  so  big, she  built  the  bed  over  the  bathtub  --  It's, quite  fascinating.
Well, what  i  Didn't  know  was, and  what  we  found  out  was  --  these  guys, they  Can't, even  like  talk  to  each  other  under  those  conditions.
There  was  a  whole  lot  of  dialog  
We  spent  four  hours  being  told  all  about  vocabulary  that  needs  to  be  built  between  engineers  and  designers, 
Dialog  kept  on  going  with  mental  maps  of  words. And  pretty  soon  it  was  becoming  obvious  that  instead  of  being  Dazzled  with  brilliance, i  was  seriously  being  Baffled  with  bullshit.
Because  of  course, they  Didn't  tell  us  that  they  had  three  station, Wagons  full  of  drawings  model, concepts  pictures  --  everything  i  wanted  They'd  locked  up  in  the  cars.
It's  true  that  the  trust  and  the  love  that  makes  it  worthwhile  
We  Didn't  sequence  his  genome  
And  the  reason  is  that  cancer, like  every  cell  in  the  body  places, little  molecular  Bookmarks  little  post-it  notes  that  remind  the  cell  I'm  cancer, i  should  keep  growing  
We  just  started  mailing  it  to  our  friends  
And  as  we  treat  it  with  our  compound, this  addiction  to  sugar, this  rapid  growth, faded  
And  in  fact, this  molecule  prevents  this  Adipocyte  this  fat  stem  cell  from  remembering  how  to  make  fat  such  that  mice  on  a  high  fat  diet, like  the  folks  in  my  hometown  of  chicago  fail  to  develop  fatty  liver, which  is  a  major  medical  problem.
This  molecule  will  soon  leave  our  benches  and  go  into  a  small  startup  company  called  Tensha  therapeutics.
I've, never  seen  really  anywhere  this  unique  support  for  cancer  research  
The  age  of  the  universe  between  now, and  the  big  bang  is  a  hundred  billion  in  dog  years.
If  you  looked  at  one  of  these  galaxies  and  measured  its  velocity, it  would  be  moving  away  from  you.
And  if  you  look  at  a  galaxy  even  farther  away, it  would  be  moving  away  faster.
That  kind  of  makes  sense  to  us  
The  air  in  this  room  is  very  smooth.
In  particular  things  were  a  lot  denser, ,
What  you  have  to  think  about  is  we  have  a  universe  with  a  hundred  billion  galaxies, a  hundred  billion  stars, each  
We'd  like  to  understand  that  
One  of  the  people  who  did  understand  that  this  was  a  problem  was  richard  feynman  
The  arrow  of  time  Cannot  be  completely  understood  until  the  mystery  of  the  beginnings  of  the  history  of  the  universe  are  reduced  still  further  from  speculation  to  understanding  
It's, not  true  that  We've  figured  it  out  by  now  
The  reason  the  problem  has  gotten  worse, rather  than  better  is  because  in  1998, we  learned  something  crucial  about  the  universe  that  we  Didn't  know  before  
And  so  even  though  the  universe  will  last  forever  and  ordinary  matter  and  radiation  will  dilute  away, there  will  always  be  some  radiation, some  thermal  fluctuations, even  in  empty  space.
It  will  probably  increase, and  the  probability  is  enormously  huge  .
Remember  life  itself  depends  on  the  arrow  of  time.
Occasionally, you  will  make  a  planet  or  a  star  or  a  galaxy  or  a  hundred  billion  galaxies.
Now, your  homework  assignment  is  to  really  think  about  this  to  contemplate  what  it  means.
I  just  showed  you  this  picture  
They  all  happen  over  a  period  of  time, equal  to  10  to  the  10  to  the  120  years  
So  Here's  two  questions  for  you  
Maybe  there  is  something  that  naturally  through  the  growth  of  the  laws  of  physics  gives  rise  to  universe, like  ours  in  low  entropy  configurations.
My  bold  speculation  is  that  i  will  be  absolutely  Vindicated  by  history.
And  50  years  from  now, all  of  my  current  wild  ideas  will  be  accepted  as  truths  by  the  scientific  and  external  communities.
This  is  a  prediction.
I  would  like  to  share  that  story  today, 
Like  everyone  else  we  grew  maize  
I  felt  very  happy  to  be  at  the  secondary  school. So  i  was  determined  to  do  anything  possible  to  receive  education.
So  i  went  to  a  library  
So  i  would  like  to  say  something  to  all  the  people  out  there  like  me  to  the  africans  and  the  poor  who  are  struggling  with  your  dreams.
God, bless  
Unlike  most  of  our  computing  devices, these  objects  are  much  more  fun  to  use  
A  gesture  of  namaste, maybe  to  respect  someone  or  maybe  --  in  india, i  Don't  need  to  teach  a  kid  that  this  means  four  runs  in  cricket  
So  i  was  interested  in  these  two  rollers, and  i  actually  wanted  more.
What  i  got  is  basically  a  gesture  interface  device  that  actually  acts  as  a  Motion-sensing  device  made  for  two  dollars.
What  we  are  interested  in  is  information  
So  i  thought  around  last  year  --  in  the  beginning  of  the  last  year  --  i  started  thinking, why  can  i  not  take  this  approach  in  the  reverse  way?
But  later  i  realized  that  i  actually  wanted  to  interact  with  those  digital  pixels  also, 
You  stop  by  a  wall  and  start  painting  on  that  wall.
So  technically  It's  a  little  bit  complex, but  it  gives  you  an  output, which  is  more  intuitive  to  use  in  some  sense.
Rather  than  getting  your  camera  out  of  your  pocket.
Once  it  has  that  information, it  finds  out  more  reviews  about  that, or  maybe  new  york  times  has  a  sound  overview  on  that.
So  i  was  seeing  the  live  [video]  of  his  talk  outside  on  just  a  newspaper  
So  what  i  did  here  is  remove  the  camera  --  all  the  webcam  cameras  have  a  microphone  inside  the  camera  
And  i  am  a  wilderness  explorer  in  tribe, 54), and  you  can, of  course, play  games.
Yeah, and  i  say, ok, this  looks  nice. Let  me  print  it  out  that  thing.
Thank  you  
This  is  incredible  really  
And  now, if  you  see  It's  more  about  the  Cost-effectiveness, this  system  costs, you  $300  compared  to  the  $20000  surface, tables  or  anything  like  that.
Or  maybe  even  the  $2  mouse  gesture  system  at  that  time  was  costing  around  $5000  
No  this  theory  comes  from  an  expert  on  Barnacles  and  worms  and  pigeon  breeding.
Taste  for  both  natural  beauty  and  for  the  arts  travel  across  cultures, with  great  ease  
Now, i  personally  have  no  doubt  whatsoever  that  the  experience  of  beauty  with  its  emotional  intensity  and  pleasure  belongs  to  our  evolved  human  psychology, 
Now, keeping  these  ideas  firmly  in  mind, we  can  say  that  the  experience  of  beauty  is  one  of  the  ways  that  evolution  has  of  Arousing  and  sustaining  interest  or  fascination, even  obsession  in  order  to  encourage  us  toward  making  the  most  adaptive  decisions  for  survival  and  reproduction  .
Beauty  is  Nature's  way  of  acting  at  a  distance.
Consider  briefly  an  important  source  of  aesthetic  pleasure, the  magnetic  pull  of  beautiful  landscapes, 
Their  symmetry, their  attractive  materials. And  above  all, their  Meticulous  Workmanship  are  simply  quite  beautiful  to  our  eyes.
Competently  made  hand  axes, indicated, desirable  personal  qualities  --  intelligence, fine  motor  control, planning  ability, Conscientiousness  and  sometimes  access  to  rare  materials, 
So  before  i  talk  about  this  car  for  the  blind, let  me  briefly  tell  you  about  another  project  that  i  worked  on  called  the  darpa  urban  challenge.
Now, this  was  about  building  a  robotic  car  that  can  drive  itself  
So  It's, a  small  tablet  has  many  holes  in  it  and  compressed  air  comes  out. So  it  can  actually  draw  images.
And  He's  [unclear]  following  that  van  That's  out  in  front  of  him, 
So  since  we  started  this  project, We've  been  getting  hundreds  of  letters, emails  phone  calls  from  people  from  all  around  the  world.
But  potentially  more  important  than  this  is  the  tremendous  value  of  the  spin-off  technology  that  can  come  from  this  project.
Why  do  we  call  it  that  
I  Don't  know, taiwan  straits, 2025  
Let's  talk  about  an  enemy  embedded  within  that  battle  space  
They  said, we  Couldn't  do  iraq  
You  have  to  create  internal  partners, you  have  to  access  coalition  partners.
We  asked  the  russians  for  40000  
They  said, no  
Like  saddam  like  Mugabe, like  kim, Jong-il  --  people  who  kill  in  hundreds  of  thousands  or  millions  
Like  the  250000  dead  so  far  in  sudan  
And  Let's  call  this  red  line.
What  we  need  downstream  is  a  great  power  enabled  --  what  i  call  that  sys  admin  force  
You've  got  to  track  coalition  partners, create  a  record  of  success  
So  they  start  moving  from  reality  towards  desire, and  they  create  their  own  special  language  to  describe  their  voyage  of  Self-discovery  and  Self-actualization  
We  bought  one  military  and  we  operated  another  
I  used  to  give  this  brief  inside  the  pentagon  in  the  early  1990s  
Bad  pentagon, bad  ,
It  elevates  Mootw  --  how  we  Pronounce  that  acronym  --  from  crap  to  grand  strategy  because  That's, how  You're  going  to  shrink  that  gap  
A  department  of  war, a  department  of  everything  else.
Our  long-term  rationale  becomes  We're  involved  in  a  hair  trigger  stand  off  with  the  soviets.
The  question  is, how  do  we  reconnect  american  national  security  with  global  security  to  make  the  world, a  lot  more  comfortable  and  to  embed  and  Contextualize  our  employment  of  force  around  the  planet?
Just  be  grateful  robert  reed  Didn't  shove  that  bomb  up  his  ass  
I  love  this  force, i  Don't  want  to  see  it  go  
What  does  this  mean  in  terms  of  operations?
The  force  on  the  right  in  and  out  
The  force  on  the  Right's  going  to  Obliterate  it  
Different  definitions  of  network, Centricity  
But  ultimately  You're  going  to  Civilianize  it  probably  two  thirds  
But  you  need  lots  of  these  guys  on  the  ground  to  win  the  peace.
The  point  about  the  Trigger-pullers  and  special  operations  command  
See  me  now  Don't  talk  about  it  later, 
The  world  is  my  playground  
I  want  the  rules  to  be  as  loose  as  possible  
The  town  was  burned  down. It  was  in  the  middle  of  winter, and  it  was  a  very, very  severe  winter.
And  That's  what  We're  going  through  at  this  time.
I  wanted  to  just  talk  for  one  minute  about  the  future  of  biotechnology, because  i  think  i  know  very  little  about  that  --  I'm, not  a  biologist  --  so  everything  i  know  about.
But  That's  hard  to  do, unfortunately, the  ice  is  thick  
But  we  can  look  outside  very  cheaply  and  in  a  simple  fashion  
And  the  step  from  the  ocean  to  the  land  was  not  easy, but  it  happened.
So  they  would  have  to  have  something  like  a  Reptilian  skin  
The  sunlight  in  jupiter  on  the  satellites  of  jupiter  is  25  times  fainter  than  it  is  here  since  jupiter  is  five  times  as  far  from  the  sun.
This  was  --  originally, when  radio  astronomy  began  mr, jansky  at  the  bell  labs, detected, radio  waves  coming  from  the  sky.
Since  there  was  nothing  there  you  might  as  well  not  look  
There  is  something  called  pit  Lamping  
So  these  creatures  will  be  bright  against  the  cold, surroundings, 
I  call  these  creatures  sunflowers  
If  we  Don't  find  them, then  we  can  create  them  ourselves.
In  the  long  run, of  course, it  would  also  make  it  possible  for  us  to  move  out  there.
But  in  the  long  run, if  There's  no  life  there, we  create  it  ourselves.
So, again, we  have  a  big  and  wonderful  future  to  look  forward.
Thank  you  
And  i  realized, then  i  had  to  go  to  design  school  
Or  What's  this  Num  lock  key  for, you  know  that  thing  
And  i  Didn't  want  to  be  a  Colorist  
And  that  allows  me  to  check  my  timer  Discretely  here  without  bending, my  elbow  
And  something  a  little  bit  more  experimental. This  is  a  light  fixture  for  Swarovski. And  what  it  does  is  it  changes  shape.
And  the  new  experience  i  was  looking  for  is  giving  the  choice  for  the  user  to  go  from  a  warm, sort  of  glowing, kind  of  mood  light, all  the  way  to  a  bright  work, light  
I  want  to  point  at  something  here  on  the  left  
And  this  allows  the  bottle  to  turn  into  a  game  
The  bottles  connect  together, and  you  can  create  different  shapes.
And  then  the  integration  of  all  these  great  technologies  which  You've  heard  about  the  wi-fi  antennas  that  allow  the  kids  to  connect  the  screen, which  you  can  read  in  sunlight, the  keyboard  which  is  made  out  of  rubber  and  It's  protected  from  the  environment.
And  if  anybody  asks  why  You're  carrying  a  condom, you  can  just  say  you  like  the  design  
Much  of  my  life  has  been  a  quest  to  get  some  answers  to  these  questions.
I  was  born  and  raised  here  in  india. And  i  learned  from  an  early  age  to  be  deeply  suspicious  of  the  Aunties  and  uncles  who  would  bend  down.
Late  that  night, i  heard  my  mother, begging, my  father, please  do  something  Ramu  Can't.
This  is  tradition, 
She  said  to  me, it  is  not  about  the  Burka  
Had  i  heard  right  
She  is  on  the  Taliban's  hit  list.
Their  path  is  their  own, and  it  looks  towards  an  afghanistan  that  will  be  different  .
Their  repertoire  includes  the  Croatian  national  anthem, a  bosnian  love  song  and  serbian  Duets  
In  the  middle  ages, Troubadours  would  travel  across  the  land, singing  their  tales  and  sharing  their  verses  lesbor  travels  through  the  balkans, like  this  singing  connecting  people, divided  by  religion, nationality  and  language  
The  world  layma  Bowie  was  given  was  a  world  at  war.
At  the  next  friday  sermon, the  women  who  were  sitting  in  the  side  room  of  the  mosque  began  to  share  their  distress  at  the  state  of  affairs.
In  a  now  famous  cnn  clip, you  can  see  them  sitting  on  the  ground, their  arms, linked  ,
The  police  are  called  in  to  physically  remove  the  women  
And  then  you  realize  that  by  integrating  aspects  of  tradition  and  community  into  their  struggles  women  like  sakena  and  leah  and  layma  --  but  also  women  like  Sonia, gandhi  here  in  india  and  Michelle  Bachelet  in  chile  and  shirin  Ebadi  in  iran  --  are  doing  something  else.
And  the  first  thing  i  wanted  to  do  as  a  muslim  was  go  to  mecca  and  visit  the  kaaba, the  holiest  shrine  of  islam  
And  i  did  that  i  put  on  my  ritualistic  dress, i  went  to  the  holy  mosque. I   did  my  prayers. I   observed  all  the  rituals.
In  other  words, men  and  women  were  Worshiping  all  together, 
And  i  think  It's  not  an  accident  that  you  Don't  find  this  idea  in  the  very  origin  of  islam  
On  the  other  hand, the  westerners  who  look  at  islamic  culture  and  see  some  troubling  aspects  should  not  readily  conclude  that  this  is  what  islam  Ordains  
And  the  religious  police  imposes  the  supposed  islamic  way  of  life  on  every  citizen  by  force  --  like  women  are  forced  to  cover  their  heads  --  wear  the  Hijab, the  islamic  head  cover  
Let  me  give  you  an  example  in  turkey, where  i  come  from, which  is  a  very  Hyper-secular  republic. Until  very  recently, we  used  to  have  what  i  call  Secularism  police, which  would  guard  the  universities  against  veiled  students.
In  other  words, they  would  force  students  to  uncover  their  heads. And  i  think  forcing  people  to  uncover  their  head  is  as  Tyrannical  as  forcing  them  to  cover. It.
Which  means  that  muslims  can  today  look  at  those  things  and  say, well, the  core  of  our  religion  is  here  to  stay  with  us.
And  even  the  very  extreme  forms  of  islamism  led  to  terrorism  in  the  name  of  islam  --  which  is  actually  a  practice  that  i  think  is  against  islam.
And  i  think  the  west  at  least  some  powers  in  the  west, particularly  the  united  states  made  the  mistake  of  supporting  those  secular  dictators  thinking  that  they  were  more  helpful  for  their  interests.
Secondly, in  the  past  two  decades, thanks  to  globalization, thanks  to  the  market  economy. Thanks  to  the  rise  of  a  middle-class.
As  a  photographer  for  national  geographic, I've  portrayed  it  for  many  
And  where  that  energy  touches  water, something  new  emerges  life  
Shallow  seas: nurtured  life, early  on  and  That's, where  it  morphed  into  more  complex  forms.
The  fundamental  forms  of  ferns, followed  to  bear  spores  that  Foreshadowed  seeds.
Leatherbacks  and  Tuataras  are  echoes  from  that  era.
Jurassic  park, still  Shimmers  in  part  of  madagascar  and  the  center  of  brazil, where  plants  called  Cycads  remain  rock  hard  
Flamingos, covered  continents, migrations  got  underway  
Water  Lilies  were  among  the  first  
In  africa, Gondwana  molded  Proteas  
Tropical  rainforests  arose, Sparking  new  layers  of  interdependence, 
A  trick  shared  by  the  largest  flower  on  earth.
An  asteroid  hits  and  the  world  went  down  in  flames, 
Primates  emerge  from  jungles  as  Tarsiers  first  becoming  Lemurs, not  much  later  
And  you  all  here  today  can  imagine  and  will  shape  where  we  go  next  
Today  i  want  to  talk  to  you  about  ethnic  conflict  and  civil  war.
But  Let's  start  at  the  beginning.
Well, notwithstanding  the  gloomy  pictures  from  the  middle  east  darfur, iraq  elsewhere.
The  news  about  civilian  casualties  is  also  less  bad  than  it  used  to  be  
Thus, even  though  every  civilian  killed  Maimed, raped  or  tortured, is  one  too  many  the  fact  that  the  number  of  civilian  casualties  is  clearly  lower  today  than  it  was  a  decade  ago, is  good  news.
But  Let's  look  at  the  good  news  again, 
But  then  is  northern  ireland, a  unique  example, or  does  this  kind  of  explanation  only  hold  more  generally  in  democratic  and  developed  countries.
A  final  example: kosovo  ,
Central  among  them  are  three  
By  the  same  token  --  and  here  we  have  some  good  news  again  --  the  very  fact  that  there  is  a  high-level  Well-resourced, international  presence  in  kosovo  and  the  balkans  region, more  generally.
A  final  thought, ending  civil  wars  is  a  process  that  is  fraught  with  dangers  frustrations  and  setbacks  
Thank  you  
I'm  going  to  talk  about  some  of  my  discoveries  around  the  world  through  my  work.
And  at  that  young  age  10  years  old, benki  became  the  Paje  of  his  community.
He  went  3000  miles  on  an  odyssey  to  rio  to  the  earth  summit  to  tell  the  world  what  was  happening  in  his  tiny  little  corner  
Benki  came  back  to  his  village, full  of  ideas  --  new  technologies, new  research, new  ways  of  understanding  what  was  going  on  
He's  built  schools  to  teach  children  to  care  for  the  forest  
Together, He's  led  the  reforestation  of  over  25  percent  of  the  land  that  had  been  destroyed  by  the  Loggers  
Why  are  you  putting  yourself  at  risk?
So  when  i  think  of  that, i  wonder  what  our  grandchildren  and  our  Great-grandchildren, when  they  ask  themselves  that  question, i  wonder  how  they  will  answer  
For  me, the  world  is  Veering  towards  a  future.
You  also  know  that  we  Can't  just  keep  doing  what  We've  always  done  because  We'll  get  the  results.
We  have  to  change  
It's  imperative  to  me  when  i  look  around  the  world  that  we  need  to  change  ourselves.
Sanghamitra  Didn't  start  life  as  a  leader  of  an  ngo.
They  take  care  of  20000-odd  people  today  in  over  1000  villages  around  karnataka, 
They've  pioneered  a  different  approach  to  villages  
Instead  of  handing  out  information  in  Pamphlets, as  is  so  often  the  case  they  bring  theater, Troupes  songs, music, dance, ,
Sanghamitra  told  me  just  last  week  --  she  had  just  come  back  from  two  weeks  in  the  villages, and  she  had  a  real  breakthrough.
He  has  nine  other  buildings  --  that  are  already  open  to  the  public  --  filled  to  the  Rafters  with  artifacts  documenting  contemporary  chinese  history.
They  looked  outside, and  then  they  changed  what  was  on  the  inside  
They've  gone  away  from  what  they  did  before  and  They've  gone  to  something.
He  went  around  once  he  went  around  twice, he  went  around  Thrice  
And  so  when  you  study  it, you  realize  that  different  people  of  the  world  have  a  different  understanding  of  the  world.
Perhaps  he  was  a  Jain  monk  like  Bahubali  over  here.
Alexander  asked, what  are  you  doing  
And  they  both  laughed  
What  should  you  not  be  
You  should  not  be  Sisyphus  who  rolls  a  rock  up  a  mountain  all  day, only  to  find  the  boulder  rolled  down  at  night  
And  he  wanted  to  Hoist  his  flag  to  say, i  was  here  first  
This  was  the  mythology  of  the  gymnosophist  
But  they  were  not  two  characters  on  two  different  adventures.
You  see  the  indians  also  had  a  river  that  separates  the  land  of  the  living  from  the  land  of  the  dead  
You  go  again  and  again  and  again, 
Two  different  Mythologies, two  different  ways  of  looking  at  the  world.
And  i  believe  it  is  this  mythological  paradigm  that  inspired  indian  mathematicians  to  discover  the  number  zero  
Who  knows  
Standard  business  model: vision, mission  values: processes, 
You  see  this  is  what  india  is  today.
I  have  personally  experienced  it  I'm  trained  as  a  medical  doctor  
And  he  knew  very  intuitively  that  best  practices  developed  in  japan  and  china  and  europe  and  america  will  not  work  in  india.
You  Can't  measure  it, you  Can't  manage  it  
After  a  leader  completes  his  training  and  is  about  to  take  over  the  store, we  blindfold  him.
That  sensitivity  is  what  we  need. Once  this  belief  enters  behavior  will  happen. Business  will  happen.
But  that  was  interesting  in  itself.
The  little  box  has  your  phone  number  :
It's  really  cute  seeing  middle-aged  people  like  me, try  out  skype  for  the  first  time, which  is  usually  when  their  kid  goes  away  for  a  semester  abroad.
They  Don't  want  to  pay  the  international  fees.
Imagine  if  you  had  an  ordinary  cell  phone  and  any  time  you  were  in  a  wireless  hotspot  --  free  calls  anywhere  in  the  world, never  pay  the  cellular  company.
And  when  You're  out  of  the  hotspot  You're  on  the  regular  cellular  network  
You're  thinking, well, how  often  am  i  in  a  hotspot  
Because  they  give  you  a  regular, wireless  Router  that  works  with  the  phone  for  your  house.
They  Don't  have  that  kind  of  money.
Now, I'm, leaving  the  house, Dp  I'm, going  for  a  walk  --  do  you  mind  ?
I  Don't  know  why  my  wife  says, i  never  listen  to  her.
I  have  two  cellphones.
Excuse  me, one  second  
All  right  We've  made  the  point  
The  beauty  of  that  is  you  never  miss  a  call  
Google  bought  it  and  They've  been  working  on  it  for  a  year  
I  actually  got  a  photograph  of  the  verizon  employee, right  there.
Anyway, so  lets  say  you  need  a  Drugstore  near  chicago  
Here, it  comes  
And  It's  already  written  down  --  so  like  if  You're  driving, you  Don't  have  to  do  one  of  these  things. Uh, huh? Uh, huh? Uh, huh?
Shortly  I'll, tell  you  why  i  was  in  milan, 
That's  cute, i  do  have  an  email  address.
It's  absolutely  phenomenal. The  only  downside  is  that  it  requires  you  to  know  how  to  text  --  send  a  text  message.
So  I'm  going  to  teach  you  something  even  better  
They  put  this  Teeny-weeny  little  ad  about  10  characters  long  
Because  there  is  one  
As  you  can  imagine  It's  college  kids  and  old  people  
When  i  call  to  leave  you  a  message, i  get  15  seconds  of  instructions  from  a  Third-grade  teacher  on  Ambien  
So  now, I'm  going  to  tell  you  how  to  get  out  of  that  
The  reason  i  think  that  is  that  on  the  first  day, i  tried  one  of  these  services, i  got  two  voicemail  messages. One  was  from  a  guy  named  michael  stevenson, which  Shouldn't  be  that  hard  to  transcribe.
I  love  my  job  
I'm, not  kidding.
And  lastly, i  just  have  to  talk  about  this  one  
Phone, well, That's, good  ,
What  are  you  doing  
Actually  even  so  he  was  turned  down  by  verizon  and  others.
It's  got  bad  things  and  good  things, lets  all  acknowledge  that  right  now, 
It's, absurd, we  have  power  outlets  in  every  room  of  every  building.
You  type  in  what  you  want, and  it  gives  you  the  translation.
I  know, It's  insane  right?
It  will  immediately  play  you  that  song, or  that  band  
If  you  like  that  one  or  Don't  like  it, you  do  Thumbs-up  and  Thumbs-down  over  time. It  Tailors  the  songs  so  that  it  completely  stops  playing  bad  songs.
It  Proposes  a  restaurant  
And  now  the  end  is  near  
I  want  an  iphone  
Who  cares  if  It's  At&ampt  
Because  the  breast  has  become  are  very  political  organ  
I  will  do  my  best  this  morning  to  tell  you  what  i  think  is  the  truth.
But  first  my  Disclosures  
She  came  to  see  me  after  discovering  a  breast  lump  
You  may  recall  a  year  ago  when  a  Firestorm  erupted  after  the  united  states, preventive  services  task  force  reviewed, the  World's  mammography  screening  literature  and  issued  a  Guideline  Recommending  against  screening  mammograms  in  women  in  their  40s  
Screening  the  average  young  woman, with  an  mri  is  kind  of  like  driving  to  the  grocery  store  in  a  hummer  
But  the  problem  was  that  the  gamma  detectors  were  these  huge  Bulky  tubes, and  they  were  filled  with  these  Scintillating  crystals, and  you  just  Couldn't, get  them  close  enough  around  the  breast  to  find  small  tumors.
To  say  that  we  faced  high  doses  of  skepticism  in  those  early  years  is  just  a  huge  understatement, but  we  were  so  convinced  that  we  might  be  able  to  make  this  work  that  we  chipped  away  with  incremental  modifications  to  this  system.
The  patient  receives  an  injection  of  a  radio  Tracer  That's  taken  up  by  rapidly  Proliferating  tumor  cells, but  not  by  normal  cells.
Our  big  break  came  in  2004  
After  we  had  demonstrated  that  we  could  find  small  tumors.
And  we  were  elated  when  they  took  a  chance  on  a  team  of  completely  unknown  Investigators  and  funded  us  to  study  1000  women  with  dense  breasts, comparing  a  screening  mammogram  to  an  mbi  
Here's  an  example  from  that  screening  study  
It  takes  a  radiologist  years  of  specialty  training  to  become  expert  in  Differentiating, the  normal  anatomic  detail  from  the  worrisome, finding  
But  i  suspect  even  the  Non-radiologists  in  the  room  can  find  the  tumor  on  the  mbi  image.
After  the  fourth  Rejection, we  Requested  Reconsideration  of  the  manuscript. Because  we  strongly  suspected  that  one  of  the  reviewers  who  had  rejected  it  had  a  financial  conflict  of  interest  in  a  competing  technology.
Some  women  who  develop  breast  cancer  die  from  it  many  years  later  and  most  women, thankfully  survive  
So  i  worked  with  white  noise  
And  do  not  be  disturbed  any  more  by  the  other  aggressive  sound, 
But  it  is  just  physiology  It's, just  in  your  brain  
So  in  order  to  make  this  white  noise  a  little  bit  active  and  reactive, i  create  a  ball  a  rolling  ball  able  to  analyze  and  find  where  does  aggressive  sound  come  from  and  roll  at  home, or  at  work  towards  aggressive  noise  and  emits  white  noise. In  order  to  neutralize  it.
A  loving  dispute  with  your  girl  or  boyfriend, 
Anyway, in  this  same  kind  of  approach, i  designed  k  
I'm  just  a  designer, so  i  need  them  
And  the  irony  for  me  was, of  course, i  Didn't  do  that  for  the  sake  of  science, progress  
I  just  do  that  to  make  money  
So  we  took  too  many  of  them  
This  one  is  an  antibiotic  
But  in  this  case, it  is  not  the  medication  that  is  dependent  on  the  patient  
So  the  idea  is  all  night  long  the  elastic  skin  of  the  third  lung  will  slowly  inflate  itself, including  air  and  molecules  for  sure, 
You  have  to  know, or  you  probably  already  know  that  indoor  air  pollution  is  more  toxic  than  outdoor  one  
So  while  I'm  talking  to  you  the  seats, you  are  sit  on  are  currently  emitting  some  invisible  and  Odorless  toxic  gas.
So  your  sofa, your  plastic  chair, your  Kid's  toys, give  their  own  invisible  reality.
This  one  is  kind  of  the  same  approach, because  i  include  in  a  product  like  andrea, some  plants  
Indeed, this  object  is  a  domestic  farm  for  fishes  and  green  
So  the  idea  of  this  object  is  to  be  able  to  get  at  home  very  local  food  
After  it  goes  back  into  the  fish  tank  
Now, we  can  eat  local  food, 
See  like  this  one  
You  can  see  it  there.
We're  the  new  technologists, 
I  think  about  world  war  ii  --  some  of  our  great  technologists, then  some  of  our  great  physicists, studying  nuclear  fission  and  fusion  --  just  nuclear  stuff, 
We  want  the  people  building  the  technology  thinking  about  what  we  should  be  doing  with  the  technology.
So  we  can  protect  ourselves  if  he  was  up  to  no  good  
So  to  get  people  warmed  up  Let's, start  with  an  easy  question  --  something, I'm, sure, everybody.
But  he  was  worried  that  all  we  seem  to  be  doing  is  trading  opinions  about  this  
In  math, we  know  the  objective  facts.
It's  an  objective  truth  about  the  form  of  two, the  abstract  form, 
Then  you  would  know  what  was  really  just  and  what  Wasn't  
If  you  think  that  way  you  have  a  Platonist  moral  framework, 
He  thought  it  was  impractical  
It's  just  a  matter  of  the  consequences  
Kant  was  very  good  on  this  point.
What  should  we  be  doing  What's?
There's, not  a  formula  
And  Don't  just  find  another  technologist  friend, find  somebody  different  than  you  
We  care  what  happens  in  that  opera  
In  the  early  '80s, some  would  say, 
The  gang  had  no  way  to  make  money  
So  he  was  a  math  major  in  college  who  had  a  good  heart  and  decided  he  wanted  to  get  a  sociology  phd  came  to  the  university  of  chicago  
And  in  his  own  words, he  looked  like  a  freak  
So  he  showed  up  at  the  university  of  chicago  
There  was  a  lot  of  gunfire. There  were  a  lot  of  philosophical  discussions.
And  you  and  i  probably  faced  with  the  situation  would  think, well, i  guess  I'm  going  to  write  my  dissertation  on  the  grateful  dead  
But  the  thing  that  really  makes  the  gang  seem  like  Mcdonald's  is  its  Franchisees  
So  what  do  the  wages  look  like?
We  found  in  our  gang  --  and  admittedly, this  was  not  really  sort  of  a  standard  situation. This  was  a  time  of  intense  violence  --  of  a  lot  of  gang  wars  --  as  this  gang  actually  became  quite  successful, but  there  were  costs.
That  makes  you  pause  --  gives  you  some  pause  --  those  of  you  who  believe  that  a  death  Penalty's  going  to  have  an  enormous  Deterrent  effect  on  crime  
That  the  young  people  controlled  the  gang  --  that  as  you  got  older, you  dropped  out  of  the  gang.
So  what  happened  was  the  people  who  happened  to  be  in  the  right  place  at  the  right  time  --  the  people  who  happened  to  be  leading  the  gang  in  the  Mid-  to  late  '80s  --  became  very, very  wealthy  
You  know, he  would  say  to  his  friends, hey, look  at  all  the  money. I   got  in  the  gang.
Often  our  theories  fail  quite  miserably.
This  is  one  of  the  basic  ideas  in  labor  economics  called  a  Compensating  differential  
It's  why  we  think  garbage  men  might  be  paid  more  than  people  who  work  in  parks.
So, in  the  words  of  one  of  the  members  of  the  gang, i  think  makes  this  clear  
And  the  words  of  a  gang  member  capture  it  quite  nicely.
If  you  start  taking  losses, they  see  you  as  weak  and  shit.
And  i  thought  about  it, and  i  said, ceos  often  pay  themselves  million-dollar  bonuses, even  when  companies  are  losing  a  lot  of  money.
Also  different  Aerobatic  Maneuvers  are  possible  with  a  Paraglider  
You  can  see  the  Skydiver  with  the  red  suit  He's  in  a  stand-up  position.
This  is  a  jump  i  did  in  rio  de  Janeiro  
2005, i  did  a  base  jump  from  the  Eiger  from  the  monk, and  from  the  Jungfrau  three, very  famous  mountains  in  switzerland, 
June  cohen, i  have  some  questions  
Yet, but  people  are  trying  are  you  among  those  --  You're, not  going  to  commit  --  are  you  among  those  trying  to  do  it?
It's  a  dream  It's, a  dream.
And  is  that  how  you  usually  fly  
Do  people  come  to  you  with  projects  and  say, we  want  you  to  do  this  
I  Don't, necessarily  think  the  film  is  so  interesting  
The  show  was  in  a  sense  about  that  
I  also  put  a  mirror  in  the  ceiling  and  some  fog.
And  what  happens  is  that  people  they  start  to  see  themselves  in  this  space, 
What  does  it  matter?
It  makes  a  difference.
It's, quite  simple  and  fundamental  
It  Doesn't  really  tell  you  what  You're  looking  at  
Or  is  that  a  Three-hour  hike, or  is  that  a  whole  day  I'm  looking  at  
If  you  have  a  waterfall  in  there  right  out  there  at  the  horizon, you  look  at  the  waterfall  and  you  go, oh, the  water  is  falling  really  slowly, 
And  experience  is  not  just  a  kind  of  entertainment  in  a  Non-casual  way.
So  art, in  that  sense, i  think  holds  an  incredible  relevance  in  the  world  in  which  We're  moving  into  particularly  right  now.
What  i  really  enjoyed  about  this  project  is  Reviving.
So  what  We're  going  to  do  next  is  a  poem  that  was  written  by  Nathalia  crane.
The  next  poem  is, if  no  one  ever  marries  me, 
He  went  there  after  the  death  of  his  wife  of  smallpox  and  brought  his  two  young  children  
Just  bring  it  down  a  little  
Thank  you  so  much  
Or  this  idea  of  the  misunderstood  genius  frustrated  that  the  world  Doesn't  fit  in  with  his  or  her  ideas.
And  quite  often, we  sit  in  a  design  meeting, and  we  discover  that  there  is  this  great  idea.
But  for  another  client  in  another  culture, it  could  really  be  the  right  answer  to  a  different  question.
And  they  chose  this  Mascot, because  the  theme  of  the  expo  is  better  city, better  life, 
But  then  we  looked  at  recent  urban  development, and  we  noticed  that  this  is  like  a  shanghai  street  30  years  ago, all  bikes.
So  if  you  come  to  the  expo  go  straight  to  the  danish  pavilion  get  a  danish  bike  and  then  continue  on  that  to  visit  the  other  Pavilions  
And  in  the  middle  of  this  sort  of  harbor  bath, We're  actually  going  to  put  the  actual  little  mermaid  
So  the  second  story  that  I'd  like  to  tell  is  actually  starts  in  my  own  house.
And  we  discovered  that  by  controlling  the  size  of  the  holes, we  could  actually  turn  the  entire  facade  into  a  gigantic  naturally, ventilated  Rasterized  image, 
It  has  no  water.
They  accumulate  the  solar  energy  
Yes, maybe  just  to  round  off  
I'm  just  going  to  list  some  of  them  
Where  should  we  start  on  solving  these  problems?
To  climate  change  that  would  be  like  kyoto, 
I'd  love  to  go  into  and  get  you  to  think  about  this  process  and  That's, actually  what  we  did  
Of  course, you  have  to  ask  yourself, why  on  earth  was  such  a  list?
Nobody  wants  to  do  this  
We'd  like  to  know  these  things  
Three  of  the  World's  top  experts, saying, what  can  we  do  
What  would  be  the  price  
And  of  course, I'm  very  happy.
This  Offends, a  lot  of  people  and  That's, probably  one  of  the  things  where  people  will  say, i  Shouldn't  come  back, either.
And  I'd  like  to  talk  about  that, because  That's  really  curious  
The  reason  why  they  came  up  with  saying  that  kyoto  --  or  doing  something  more  than  kyoto  --  is  a  bad  deal  is  simply  because  It's  very  inefficient, 
It's  not  to  say  that  if  we  had  all  the  money  in  the  world, we  Wouldn't  want  to  do  it.
There  are  many  problems  out  there  in  the  world.
And  what  i  want  to  make  sure  of  is, if  we  actually  focus  on  problems  that  we  focus  on  the  right  ones.
The  ones  where  we  can  do  a  lot  of  good, rather  than  a  little  good  
And  of  course, We'll  be  even  richer  than  that  
We  have, you  know  the  day  after  tomorrow  --  it  looks  great  right  
It's, not  about  making  things  that  have  the  most  media  attention, but  It's  about  making  places  where  we  can  actually  do  the  most  good  
But  the  point, of  course, is  still  to  say, if  you  get  another  100  billion  dollars, we  still  want  to  spend  that  in  the  best  possible  way.
So  we  actually  invited  80  young  people  from  all  over  the  world  to  come  and  solve  the  same  problem.
My  studio  in  bali  was  only  10  minutes  away  from  a  monkey  forest  and  monkeys, of  course, are  supposed  to  be  the  happiest  of  all  animals  
The  Serif  is  not  really  in  place.
And  the  rider  thinks  that  he  can  tell  the  elephant  what  to  do, but  the  elephant  really  has  his  own  ideas.
And  from  that  point  of  view, we  turned  it  into  a  lovely  project.
We  stir  this  in  until  It's  completely  dissolved, and  then  pour  it  into  a  growth  bath.
And  then  We're  ready  to  add  the  living  organism  
And  actually, in  hot  weather, i  can  just  grow  it  outside  
But  i  do  think  it  could  be  quite  a  smart  and  sustainable  addition  to  our  increasingly  precious  natural  resources.
Thank  you  very  much  
Suzanne  lee  
I  made  contact  with  a  child  from  swat  who  studied  in  a  Madrassa  like  this  
How  do  the  taliban  in  your  area  get  people  to  join  them?
Then  they  take  us  to  a  Madrassa  and  teach  us  things  from  the  koran.
They  ask  us  to  use  them  only  against  the  Infidels  
Soc, i  in  my  research  have  seen  that  the  taliban  have  perfected  the  way  in  which  they  recruit  and  train  children.
These  children  are  explicitly  forbidden  from  reading  newspapers, listening  to  radio  reading  any  books  that  the  teachers  do  not  prescribe  them.
Effectively  the  taliban  create  a  complete  blackout  of  any  other  source  of  information  for  these  children  
He  blew  himself  up  killing  six  
Two  years  ago, here  at  ted, i  reported  that  we  had  discovered  at  saturn  with  the  cassini  spacecraft, an  Anomalously  warm  and  Geologically  active  region  at  the  southern  tip  of  the  small  Saturnine  moon  enceladus.
While  They're  not  amino  acids  We're  now, finding  things  like  propane  and  benzene, hydrogen, Cyanide  and  formaldehyde  
So  we  are  very  encouraged  by  these  results.
And  this  is  quite  an  extraordinary  idea, but  it  is  reality  today, 
This  was  created  by  an  architectural  firm  called  Shiro  
And  you  can  actually  walk  into  it  
Now, 3d  printing  can  break  away  barriers  in  design, which  challenge  the  constraints  of  mass  production.
There's  a  lower  chance  of  Rejection  
The  piece  of  software  will  keep  an  individual  within  the  bounds  of  the  possible.
I  Don't  think  that  will  happen  soon  
We're  now, instead  of  shipping  a  product  across  the  world, We're  sending  data  across  the  internet  
And  applying  this  to  the  idea  of  building  up  What's  in  our  bodies, 
So  one  of  the  pioneers, for  example, is  dr.
We  like  different  things, 
I've  been  working  on  issues  of  poverty  for  more  than  20  years  and  so  It's  ironic  that  the  problem  that  and  question  that  i  most  grapple  with  is  how  you  actually  define  poverty. What  does  it  mean? ?
And  i  would  see  kids  on  the  street  corners  and  They'd  say, obama  He's, our  brother, 
And  she  said, you  know, the  poverty, Wasn't. So  bad, it  was  the  humiliation.
And  i  say, 'look  at  me, you  are  not  dead  
And  in  the  middle  of  this  economic  crisis, where  so  many  of  us  are  inclined  to  pull  in  with  fear, i  think  We're  well  suited  to  take  a  cue  from  jane  and  reach  out, recognizing  that  being  poor  Doesn't  mean, being  ordinary  
It  was  a  really  big  excitement  for  me  to  get  into  caltech  
And  i  concluded  after  researching  every  other  technology  that  we  could  deploy  for  storing  energy  --  Flywheels  different  Formulations  of  batteries  --  it  just  Wasn't  practical  to  store  energy.
There  are  a  lot  of  new  things  that  are  happening  to  do  that.
So  i  tried  to  figure  out  what  other  way  could  we  try  and  make  cost-effective  solar  electricity  
Traditionally, Concentrators  look  like  this  
Your  efficiency  goes  down  with  more  bounces  because  you  lose  about  10  percent  with  each  bounce. But  this  allowed  us  to  collect  light  from  a  plus  or  minus  25  degree  angle.
So  once  you  have  mobility  now  You're  making  a  lot  of  engines  because  You've  got  lots  of  units  as  opposed  to  steam  ships  or  big  factories  where  You're  not  making  as  many  units.
So  we  tried  to  look  at  the  stirling  engine  in  a  new  way  because  it  was  practical  --  weight, no  longer  mattered  for  our  application.
So  someone  came  up  with  a  very  clever  idea  to  --  instead  of  heating  the  whole  cylinder  and  cooling  the  whole  cylinder.
We  measured  each  one, we  Readjusted  the  model  to  what  we  measured.
It  led  to  a  very  compact, inexpensive  engine. And  this  is  what  the  engine  looks  like.
So  an  example  of  that  is  Here's  the  map  of  the  united  states  
And  of  course, look  at  africa  
There's, 10000  watts  of  light  pouring  on  the  stage. One  horsepower  is  756  watts  at  full  power.
But  everywhere  around  us, we  have  insatiable  use  for  energy  because  It's  so  cheap  ,
And  It's  cheap  because  We've  been  subsidized  by  energy  That's  been  concentrated  by  the  sun.
Headlines  that  look  like  this, when  they  have  to  do  with  climate  change  and  headlines  that  look  like  this, when  they  have  to  do  with  air  quality  or  smog  
And  this  is  the  tower  from  below  
So  as  you  can  imagine  the  inside  of  this  aircraft  Doesn't  look  like  any  plane, you  would  take  on  vacation  
We  do  all  of  this  to  understand  the  chemistry  of  one  molecule, 
What  i  am  always  thinking  about  is  what  this  session  is  about, which  is  called  simplicity.
So  i  was  fortunate  enough  to  be  born  a  very  Dreamy  child  
And  that  was  a  good  thing  to  help, you  know, the  cause  
But  then  he  came  back  and  things  happened, and  i  decided  i  really  hated  my  writing  that  it  was  awful.
Well, Tibor  really  started  the  studio  called  M&ampco  
That  to  be  able  to  talk  about  content  to  break  apart  what  you  normally  expect  to  use  humor  and  surprise  elegance  and  humanity  in  your  work  was  really  important  to  us  
I  Don't, really  --  i  mean, i  could  tell  you  that  i  Didn't  understand  I'm, not  proud  of  it.
So  I'm  open  to  the  possibilities  of  not  knowing  and  finding  out  something  new  
And  so  i  was  able  to  put  that  into  this  story, which  is  an  alphabet  and  hopefully  go  on  to  something  else.
I  work  for  the  new  yorker, and  i  do  covers  and  9/11  happened.
We  hoped  We'd  be  funny, but  we  Didn't  know  it  would  be  a  cover.
And  david  Remnick  who  was  really  wonderful  about  it  had  one  problem.
And  he  noticed  a  large  stain  in  the  center  of  the  rug  
So  what  i  did  when  i  was  painting  was  i  started  singing  because  i  really  adore  singing. And  i  think  that  music  is  the  highest  form  of  all  art.
I  happen  to  know  it  for  a  fact, 
Maybe  amongst  themselves, they  had  a  few  good  laughs, but  stalin  was  a  paranoid  man, even  more  than  my  father  
Which  i  think  i  made  up, which  is  a  good  thing.
I  received  a  box  in  the  mail, and  it  was  wrapped  with  newspaper. And  there  was  the  picture  of  the  man  on  the  newspaper, and  he  was  dead.
And  i  really  spend  a  lot  of  time, wondering  how  much  truth  do  we  tell  
How  do  we  know  when  we  are  ourselves?
A  quote, by  bertrand  russell  all  the  labor  of  all  the  ages, all  the  devotion, all  the  inspiration, all  the  Noonday  brightness  of  human  genius, are  destined  to  extinction.
And  i  would  like  to  run  it  for  them.
And  it  says, Ich  Habe  genug, which  is  a  bach  Cantata, which  i  once  thought, meant  I've  had  it. I   Can't  take  it  anymore. Give  me  a  break, but  i  was  wrong.
I  thought  that  things  would  be  pretty  fun, and  there  would  be  more  things  to  play  with  
So  since  We've  been  here, this  week, We've  taken  millions  of  Breaths  collectively, and  perhaps  we  Haven't  witnessed, any  course  changes  happening  in  our  lives, but  we  often  miss  the  very  subtle  changes.
So  we  threw  in  --  we  created  a  primordial  soup  with  lots  of  pieces  of  robots  --  with  bars  with  motors  with  neurons, 
We're  concerned  in  the  national  security  community.
It's  also  carried  on  migration  patterns  of  wild  Migratory  aquatic  birds, 
So  what  have  people  been  doing  with  this  money?
Let's  everybody  run  around  and  play  your  role  
Most  local  facilities  would  all  be  competing  to  try  and  get  their  hands  on  their  piece  of  the  federal  stockpile  of  a  drug  called  tamiflu, which  may  or  may  not  be  helpful  --  I'll  get  into  that  --  of  available  vaccines  and  any  other  treatments  and  masks  and  anything  That's  been  Stockpiled  
And  You'll  have  massive  competition, 
During  the  sars  epidemic  in  beijing, quarantine  did  seem  to  help  
And  their  hand  got  contaminated  with  the  outside  of  the  mask, and  then  they  rubbed  their  nose.
The  pandemic  circulated, three  times  in  18  months  in  the  absence  of  commercial  air  travel, 
This  was  based  on  european  and  north  american  data.
And  that  a  more  likely  toll  is  somewhere  in  the  neighborhood  of  80  to  100  million  people  before  we  had  commercial  air  travel, 
So  are  we  ready  
If  you  expand  that  out  to  think  of  a  whole  community  or  all  your  employees  in  your  company, you  begin  to  realize  how  limited  the  tamiflu  option  might  be  
But  really  do  you  really  have  a  place  to  stockpile  18  months  worth  of  food?
Do  you  want  to  view  the  pandemic  threat, the  way  back  in  the  1950s  people  viewed  the  civil  defense  issue  and  build  your  own  little  bomb  shelter  for  pandemic  flu.
And  i  hope  I've  convinced  you  of  that, which  means  that  the  real  job  is  go  out  and  say  to  your  local  leaders  and  your  national  leaders. Why  Haven't  you  solved  these  problems?
But  can  you  sustain  your  company  that  way  
The  moment  that  you  see  any  evidence  of  serious  human-to-human  to  transmission  
The  mechanism  Isn't  clear, 
Again, we  Don't  really  know  for  sure, 
Audience  member: one  of  the  things  I've  heard  is  that  the  real  death  cause  when  you  get  a  flu  is  the  associated  pneumonia, and  that  a  pneumonia  vaccine  may  offer  you  50  percent  better  chance  of  survival  
And  so  far  in  the  H5n1  cases  in  people, similarly, bacterial  infection  has  not  been  an  issue  at  all  
And  it  Won't  do  any  good  to  bring  in  the  tanks  and  the  artillery  because  those  T-cells  Don't  recognize  it  either  
Now, my  story  has  a  lot  to  do  with  dreaming, although  I'm  known  to  make  my  dreams  come  true: 
One, two, three, four, five, six  and  seven  
And  i  go  to  see  a  famous  magician  and  proudly  ask  him, well, what  do  you  think  
For  the  move  to  be  professional, it  has  to  be  less  than  one  second. And  it  has  to  be  perfect  .
But  in  america, you  have  to  explain  what  are  clubs  
They  have  to  be  precisely  Lathed  
Anyway, here  i  was  progressing  with  my  new  clubs  
The  clubs  were  escaping  me  at  each, throw  
So  i  proudly  showed  him  my  clubs  
He  said, philippe, you  have  been  had  
They  are  impossible  to  juggle  
I  get  a  pair  of  Pliers  and  some  coat  hangers, and  i  gather  them  together  in  some  kind  of  Ropey  path.
Well, within  a  few  days, I'm  able  to  do  one  crossing  
If  not  i  will  never  do  that  first  step  
It's  a  straight  line, which  Sags  which  Sways  which  vibrates  which  rolls  on  itself, which  is  ice, which  is  three  tons  tight. Ready  to  explode.
An  inner  Howl  Assails  me  the  wild  longing  to  flee  
I  was  not  interested  in  collecting  the  gigantic  in  breaking  records, 
And  something  happened  
He  Didn't  know  the  true  story  
Trees  are  wonderful  arenas  for  discovery  because  of  their  tall  stature  their  complex  structure, the  biodiversity, they  foster  and  their  quiet  beauty  
The  most  mysterious  part  of  forests  is  the  upper  tree  canopy  
These  are  not  Epiphyte  roots. These  are  roots  that  emerge  from  the  trunk  and  branch  of  the  host  trees  themselves.
We  know  It's  a  lot, but  we  do  not  yet  know  the  answers  to  how  much. And  by  what  processes  carbon  is  being  taken  out  of  the  atmosphere, held  in  its  biomass  and  moving  on  through  the  ecosystem.
They  ended  up  making  a  cd, which  they  took  home  to  their  family  and  friends, thereby  expressing  their  own  experiences  with  nature  in  their  own  medium.
They  were  incredibly  enthusiastic  about  the  work  
And  they  embraced  the  idea  that  they  could  help  develop  a  research  design  in  order  to  grow  these  mosses  
We  gave  talks  once  a  month, and  that  actually  ended  up  implementing  some  amazing  sustainability  projects  at  the  prisons  --  organic  gardens, worm  culture, recycling  water, Catchment  and  Beekeeping  
As  many  of  you  are  aware, the  world  of  academia  is  a  rather  Inward-looking.
I'm  trying  to  help  researchers  move  more  outward  to  have  their  own  partnerships  with  people  outside  of  the  academic  community.
When  i  look  into  my  heart, i  see  trees  --  this  is  actually  an  image  of  a  real  heart  --  there  are  trees  in  our  hearts. There  are  trees  in  your  hearts.
It  was  taken  18  years  ago.
There  is  a  problem  with  scuba  though, in  that  it  imposes  some  limitations  on  how  deep  you  can  go. And  it  turns  out  that  depth  is  about  200  feet.
And  There's  a  phenomenon  called  Henry's  law  that  says  that  gases  will  dissolve  into  a  fluid  in  proportion  to  the  partial  pressures, which  You're  exposing  them  to  
You  die  also  because  oxygen  toxicity  can  cause  a  seizure  --  makes  you  Convulse  underwater, not  a  good  thing  to  happen  underwater  
This  picture  was  taken  300  feet  deep  catching  new  species  of  fish  
And  indeed, there  is  a  better  way.
Alright, Closed-circuit  rebreather  --  what  is  it  about  it? That  makes  it  different  from  scuba. And  why  is  it  better? ?
Well, there  are  three  main  advantages  to  a  rebreather, 
So  we  need  another  gas  something  to  dilute  the  oxygen  with  
But  if  we  want  to  go  deeper, of  course, we  need  another  gas  supply.
Now, normally  you  Don't  have  to  do  that  because  all  of  It's  done  automatically  for  you  with  the  electronics.
And  yes, It's  a  little  Nerve-wracking  
So  sharks  Aren't  quite  as  dangerous  as  most  people, make  them  out  to  be  
There's  a  cover  story, all  about  the  great  explorers  of  our  time.
The  last  article  is  an  article  entitled  no  new  frontiers  
Even  if  you  ignore  the  scientific  value  of  this  thing, just  look  at  the  monetary  value  of  this  thing, 
And  then  eventually  i  got  around  to  looking  in  my  bucket  
Now, this  One's, pretty  cool  
So  a  very  large  percentage  of  what  is  out  there  Isn't  really  known  
We  thought  we  had  a  handle  on  all  the  reef  fish, diversity  --  evidently, not  
At  the  beginning, i  told  you  that  i  was  going  to  show  you  two  extraordinary  photographs, 
The  reason  i  show  this  --  not  to  put  a  Downer  on  everything  --  but  i  just  want  to  use  it  to  key  off  my  philosophy  of  life  in  general, which  is  that  we  all  have  two  goals.
The  first  goal, we  share  with  every  other  living  thing  on  this  planet, which  is  to  survive.
You  have  to  balance.
But  Here's, what  really  perplexed  me  
But  diagnosing  a  brain  disorder, without  actually  looking  at  the  brain, is  analogous  to  treating  a  patient  with  a  heart  problem  based  on  their  physical  symptoms, without  even  doing  an  ecg  or  a  chest  x-ray  to  look  at  the  heart  
Yet, despite  all  the  advances  in  medical  technology, the  diagnosis  of  brain  disorders  in  one  in  six  children  still  remained  so  limited  
And  then  i  came  across  a  team  at  harvard  university  that  had  taken  one  such  advanced  medical  technology  and  finally  applied  it.
And  another  program  called  statistical  probability  mapping  then  performs  mathematical  calculations  to  determine  whether  any  of  these  abnormalities  are  clinically  significant  allowing  us  to  provide  a  much  more  accurate  neurological  diagnosis  of  the  Child's, symptoms  
When  we  used  this  groundbreaking  eeg  technology  to  actually  look  at  Justin's  brain, the  results  were  startling  
But  we  are  now  in  a  new  era  of  neuroscience  one  in  which  we  can  finally  look  directly  at  brain  function  in  real  time  with  no  risks  and  no  side  effects  non-invasively  and  find  the  true  source  of  so  many  disabilities  in  children  
It's  something  like  life  that  once  you  get  in  it, you  Can't  get  out  
There  are  two  clips  i  want  to  show  you  the  first  one  is  a  kind  of  Hodgepodge. Its  just  three  little  moments, four  little  moments  with  three  of  the  people  who  are  here  tonight.
It  was  built, entirely  by  hand  off  bamboo.
So  those  are  the  two  clips  I'm  going  to  show  
I  mean, as  tragic  as  his  death  was  in  a  railway  station, it  was  so  consistent  with  his  life.
Man, yes, it  is  the  national  image  of  bangladesh  
No  he  never  saw  this  
And  this  is  the  largest  project  he  has  got  in  here, the  poorest  country  in  the  world, 
It's  a  story  of  nations  of  ideologies  of  territories  and  of  conflicts  among  them  
Here, 
Are  we  alone  in  this  vast  universe  of  energy  and  matter  and  chemistry  and  physics  
Whether  We're  born  in  san  francisco  or  sudan  or  close  to  the  heart  of  the  milky  way  galaxy, we  are  the  products  of  a  billion-year  lineage  of  wandering  stardust.
Well, what  about  10^22  
That  line  would  have  to  be  38  million  miles  above  this  stage  
I  think  this  is  what  david  deutsch  meant  in  2005, when  he  ended  his  oxford  tedtalk  by  saying, he  had  two  principles  He'd  like  to  share  for  living, and  he  would  like  to  carve  them  on  stone  tablets.
We've  been  searching  ever  since  but  It's  impossible  to  Overstate  the  magnitude  of  the  search  that  remains  
And  over  those  long  distances  its  signal  is  very  faint  when  it  reaches  us  
But  this  is  a  simple  signal  and  tomorrow  we  want  to  be  able  to  find  more  complex  signals.
This  is  a  very  good  year  
2009  is  the  400th  anniversary  of  Galileo's  first  use  of  the  telescope  Darwin's  200th  birthday, the  150th  anniversary  of  the  publication  of  on  the  origin  of  species, the  50th  anniversary  of  seti  as  a  science, the  25th  anniversary  of  the  Incorporation  of  the  seti  institute  as  a  non-profit.
The  first  step  would  be  to  tap  into  the  global  brain, trust  to  build  an  environment  where  raw  data  could  be  stored, and  where  it  could  be  accessed  and  manipulated  where  new  algorithms  could  be  developed.
I'm, sorry, seth  Godin.
It  records  the  annual  rise  and  fall  of  greenhouse  gases  and  temperatures  going  back  before  the  onset  of  the  last  ice, ages  
Ten  times  a  day, they  extract  the  10-foot  long  cylinder  of  compressed  ice  crystals  that  contain  the  Unsullied  air  and  trace  chemicals  laid  down  by  snow  season  after  season  for  thousands  of  years.
From  this  we  can  detect  an  extraordinary  number  of  things.
Imagine  juggling  a  snowball  across  the  tropics, 
They  have  to, in  fact, make  sure  this  ice  never  gets  warmer  than  about  20  degrees  below  zero, otherwise  the  key  gases  inside  it  will  dissipate  
Early  explorers  sailed  off  the  edge  of  the  map, and  they  found  a  place  where  the  normal  rules  of  time  and  temperature  seem  suspended  .
It  is  a  voice  of  experience.
It  is  a  voice.
This  thesis  is  set  out  in  a  book  called  winning  the  oil  endgame  that  four  colleagues, and  i  wrote  and  have  posted  for  free  at  Oilendgamecom  --  about  170000  downloads.
So  when  we  did, we  found  some  very  surprising  things  
And  serious  competition  from  europe  from  korea  and  next  is  china, which  will  soon  be  a  major  net  exporter  of  cars.
The  point  here  is  these  cars  are  going  to  be  made  super  efficient  
The  question  is, who  will  make  them  
It's  Financeable  in  the  private  capital  market, ,
And  in  the  upper  left  a  pioneering  effort, 14  years  ago  by  gm  --  84  miles  a  gallon  without  even  using  a  hybrid  in  a  Four-seater  
In  the  airplane  business  It's, again, a  similar  story, where  the  first  20  percent  fuel  saving  is  free  as  boeing  is  now  demonstrating  in  its  new  Dreamliner  
And  it  turns  out  that  these  are  quite  remarkable  for  safety  
The  golf  was  Totaled  
Because  these  materials  could  actually  absorb  six  to  12  times  as  much  energy  per  pound  as  steel  and  do.
This  expands  choice  rapidly  in  the  market  and  actually  makes  more  money  for  Automakers  as  well  
I'd  like  to  deal  with  the  lack  of  affordable, personal  mobility  in  this  country, by  making  it  very  cheaply  possible  for  low-income  families  to  get  efficient  reliable, Warranted  new  cars  that  they  could  otherwise  never  get  
This  creates  a  new  Million-car-a-year  market  for  detroit  from  customers. They  Weren't  going  to  get  otherwise  because  they  Weren't  Creditworthy  and  could  never  afford  a  new  car.
It  turns  out  that  if  say  african-american  and  white  households  had  the  same  car  ownership, it  would  cut  employment  disparity  about  in  half  by  providing  better  access  to  job  opportunities.
Just  turn  it  over  to  the  private  sector, and  we  have  an  internet  
Ours  is  on  the  demand  side, 
I  was  just  coming  out  of  a  failed, virtual  reality  business  and  supporting  myself  by  being  on  the  speaking  circuit  and  writing  books  --  after  twenty  years, or  so  in  the  computer  game  industry, having  ideas  that  people  Didn't  think  they  could  sell  
And  at  the  end  of  those  remarkable  conversations  with  kids  and  their  best  friends  across  the  united  states, after  two  years, we  pulled  together  some  survey  data  from  another  10000  children  drew  up  a  set  up  of  what  we  thought  were  the  key  findings  of  our  research  and  spent  another  year  transforming  them  into  design  Heuristics  for  designing  Computer-based  products  --  and  in  fact, any  kind  of  products  --  for  little  girls, ages, eight  to  12  
And  these  voices  will  be  accompanied  by  photographs  that  they  took  for  us  of  their  lives  of  the  things  that  they  value  and  care  about  
Girl  3: this  is  my  pretend  [unclear]  one  
This  is  the  second  day  in  Rockett's  life, 
I  wanted  to  show  you  the  ways  Innocuous  as  they  seem  in  which  We're  Incorporating, what  We've  learned  about  girls  --  their  desires  to  experience  greater  emotional  flexibility  and  to  play  around  with  the  social  complexity  of  their  lives.
He  went  through  europe  through  world  war  ii, stealing  Extorting  and  occasionally, buying  various  paintings  for  his  collection  
So  he  finally  found  an  art  dealer, a  dutch  art  dealer  named  han, van  meegeren  who  sold  him  a  wonderful  vermeer  for  the  cost  of  what  would  now  be  10  million  dollars  
He  had  a  lesser  charge  of  forgery  got  a  year  sentence  and  died  a  hero  to  the  dutch  people.
Many  sociologists  like  Veblen  and  wolfe  would  argue  that  the  reason  why  we  take  origins  so  seriously  is  because  We're  Snobs  because  We're  focused  on  status  
Would  you  eat  this  
Few  of  you  would  eat  it  if  It's  a  rat  or  a  human  ,
It's  simple: you  tell  them  They're  from  Mcdonald's  
It's  very  simple, pour  it  from  an  expensive  bottle  
It  will  make  a  difference  if  they  turn  out  to  be  much  younger  or  much  older  than  you  think  they  are  
That  drops  the  value  of  it, suggesting  that  That's.
Rather  It's  because  i  want  something  that  has  a  specific  history.
Who  here  likes  the  work  of  jackson  pollock  
And  the  washington  post, reporter, gene  Weingarten  decided  to  enlist  him  for  an  audacious  experiment.
So  he  got  joshua  bell  to  take  his  million  dollar  violin  down  to  a  washington  dc  subway  station  and  stand  in  the  corner  and  see  how  much  money  he  would  make  
He  actually  made  20  dollars  more  than  that, but  he  Didn't  count.
So  She's  stunned  that  He's  standing  in  a  subway  station, 
One  lovely  experiment  was  done  by  kurt  gray.
And  what  i  hope  to  show  is  that  Unpicking  dodgy  claims  Unpicking  the  evidence  behind  dodgy, claims  Isn't, a  kind  of  nasty, Carping  activity, It's  socially  useful, but  It's, also  an  extremely  valuable  explanatory  tool  
She  it  turns  out  has  a  Non-accredited, correspondence  course, phd  
A  glass  of  red  wine  a  day  could  help  prevent  breast  cancer  
So  I'm  going  to  tell  you  about  one  trial, which  is  probably  the  most  Well-reported  trial  in  the  uk  news  media  over  the  past  decade, 
And  this  has  been  demonstrated  in  a  whole  raft  of  fascinating  studies, comparing  one  kind  of  placebo  against  another  
We  know  from  three  different  studies  on  three  different  types  of  pain  that  a  saltwater  injection  is  a  more  effective  treatment  for  pain  than  taking  a  sugar  pill, taking  a  dummy  pill  that  has  no  medicine  in  it  --  not  because  the  injection  or  the  pills  do  anything  physically  to  the  body.
But  That's, not  enough  
What  i  find  really  fascinating  is  that  the  pharmaceutical  industry  uses  exactly  the  same  kinds  of  tricks  and  devices, but  slightly  more  sophisticated  versions  of  them  in  order  to  distort  the  evidence  that  they  give  to  doctors  and  patients, and  which  we  use  to  make  Vitally  important  decisions.
And  It's  a  Foregone  conclusion, if  you  give  a  drug  at  that  high  a  dose  that  it  will  have  more  side  effects, and  that  your  new  drug  will  look  better.
Everybody  wanted  to  show  that  their  drug  was  better  than  Risperidone. So  you  see  a  bunch  of  trials  comparing  new  antipsychotic  drugs  against  Risperidone  at  eight  milligrams  a  day.
This  is  a  drug  called  Reboxetine  
Around  half  of  all  of  the  trial  data  on  antidepressants  has  been  withheld. But  it  goes  way  beyond  that.
But  the  companies  withheld  that  data  from  them, and  so  did  the  european  medicines  agency  for  three  years.
The  infectious  diseases, cochrane  group, which  are  based  in  italy  has  been  trying  to  get  the  full  data  in  a  usable  form  out  of  the  drug  companies, so  that  they  can  make  a  full  decision  about  whether  this  drug  is  effective  or  not  and  They've, not  been  able  to  get  that  information  
This  is  undoubtedly  the  single  biggest, ethical  problem  facing  medicine  today.
Thank  you  very  much  
I  saw  people  struggling  to  get  by  not  knowing  what  was  what?
You  want  a  better  life  for  yourself.
There's  this  thing, this  Militarization  of  the  world  and  It's  centered  right  in  the  united  states, 
And  the  united  states  is  responsible  for  almost  one  half  of  the  World's  military  spending  --  four  percent  of  the  World's  population  
And  you  feel  it, you  see  it  every  day  
You  say, how  is  that  possible?
And  their  leaders  their  leaders  before  they  send  their  sons  and  daughters  off  to  war  in  your  country  --  and  you  know  the  reason  --  before  they  send  them  off, they  go  to  a  christian  church, and  they  pray  to  their  christian  god.
Why  
They  do  wonderful  things, but  they  also  do  the  bad  things.
And  this  guy, you  get  a  guy  like  Lt  gen  william  Boykin, 
And  You're  thinking, god, if  this  guy  is  saying  that  then  all  the  soldiers  must  be  saying  that  
And  this  word  here, george  bush  called  this  war, a  Crusade  
It's, a  holy  war  against  muslims  
You  feel  frightened.
He  wants  to  burn  Korans, our  holy  book, 
You  Don't  know  that  
So  here, 
And  this  is  a  perspective, 
So  Here's, what  i  want  you  to  do  
I'm  going  out  to  defend  your  freedom, your  lives  
And  if  i  can  get  you  to  step  into  their  shoes  and  walk  an  inch  one  tiny  inch, then  imagine  the  kind  of  Sociological  analysis  that  you  can  do  in  all  other  aspects  of  your  life.
Thank  you  
It  was  only  in  the  second  half  of  the  20th  century  that  we  slowly  began  to  pull  ourselves  out  of  this  abyss.
You  know, in  1950, the  typical  ship  carried, 5000  to  10000  tons  worth  of  goods.
Today, a  container  ship  can  carry  150000  tons. It  can  be  manned  with  a  smaller  crew  and  Unloaded  faster  than  ever  before.
And  i  think, as  You'll  see  There's  reasons  for  optimism.
Well, how  else  can  we  create  new  ideas?
How  else  can  we  create  new  ideas?
That  is  a  good  thing.
How  many  Ramanujans  are  there  in  india  today, Toiling  in  the  fields  barely  able  to  feed  themselves  when  they  could  be  feeding  the  world  
Twenty-first  century  could  easily  be  33, even  higher  percent  
Even  at  that  rate  by  2100  average  gdp  per  capita  in  the  world  will  be  $200000  
That's, not  that  far  
But  some  of  our  grandchildren  probably  will  
What  about  a  great  depression  
Now  Let's  imagine  that  you  were  an  economist  in  1929, trying  to  forecast  future  growth  for  the  united  states, not  knowing  that  the  economy  was  about  to  go  off  a  cliff, not  knowing  that  we  were  about  to  enter  the  greatest  economic  disaster, certainly  in  the  20th  century, 
In  the  last  30  years, thanks  to  explorations  in  remote  parts  of  the  world  and  advances  in  technology, biologists  have, for  example, added  a  full  one-third  of  the  known  frog  and  other  Amphibian  species  to  bring  the  current  total  to  5400  and  more  continue  to  pour  in  
Two  new  kinds  of  whales  have  been  discovered  along  with  two  new  Antelopes, dozens  of  monkey  species  and  a  new  kind  of  elephant  --  and  even  a  distinct  kind  of  gorilla  
Consider  the  Nematode  Roundworm, the  most  abundant  of  all  animals  
But  that  number  of  bacteria  species  can  be  found  in  one  gram  of  soil, just  a  little  handful  of  soil  in  the  10  billion  bacteria  that  would  be  there.
My  own  epiphany, as  a  conservationist  came  in  1953, while  a  harvard  graduate  student, searching  for  rare  ants, found  in  the  mountain  forests  of  cuba  ants  that  shine  in  the  sunlight  --  metallic  green  or  metallic  blue  according  to  species  and  one  species, i  discovered  metallic  gold  
And  the  final  letter  is  o, for  Over-harvesting  --  driving  species  into  extinction  by  excessive  hunting  and  fishing  
That's  in  the  united  states, 
But  what  excites  me  is  that, since  i  first  put  forward, this  particular  idea  in  that  form, science  has  advanced  
I  wish  you  would  help  them  
The  encyclopedia  will  quickly  pay  for  itself  in  practical  applications.
The  idea  that  in  that  room  at  that  moment, everyone  regardless  of  their  age, their  gender, their  race, their  color, their  religion  comes  together.
Let's  start  with  technology  
All  right  Let's, start  with  theater.
But  the  teachers  came  to  me  afterward  and  told  me, they  Hadn't  seen  the  kids  that  Attentive  
Zero  does  not  speak  is  neither  man  nor  woman, 
And  that  usually, if  You're  a  bit  extraordinary, if  You're  not  exactly  of  human  appearance, then  people  will  feel  inclined  to  participate  and  to  feel  out  loud.
I've  worked  as  a  doctor  clown  in  a  hospital  for  two  years.
It's  a  human  and  technological  revolution  
And  well, of  course, the  dutch  Can't  eat  all  these  pigs  
And  what  i  was  curious  about  --  because  historically, the  whole  pig  would  be  used  up  until  the  last  bit, so  nothing  would  be  wasted  --  and  i  was  curious  to  find  out  if  this  was  actually  still  the  case.
And  in  Cheesecake  and  all  kinds  of  Desserts  like  chocolate  Mousse  Tiramisu  vanilla  Pudding, everything  That's  cooled  in  the  supermarket  There's  gelatin  to  make  it  look  good  
Fine, bone  china  --  this  is  a  real  classic  
I  was  not  planning  on  showing  you  any  meat, because, of  course, half  the  Book's  meat. And  you  probably  all  know  what  Meats. They  are  .
And  the  reason  for  this  is  that  pigs  are  actually  quite  close  to  human  beings.
And  they  said, well, the  director  of  the  company  decided  not  to  let  you  borrow  this  heart  valve  because  want  his  product  to  be  associated  with  pigs  
Well  it  is  because  everything  that  Can't  be  used  for  anything  else  is  made  into  a  fuel  that  can  be  used  as  renewable  energy  source.
This  is  a  picture  of  Maurice  Druon, the  Honorary  perpetual  secretary  of  L'academie  Francaise, the  french  academy, 
We  see  it  in  the  constant, appearance  of  Slang  and  jargon  of  the  historical  change  in  languages  in  divergence  of  dialects  and  the  formation  of  new  languages.
The  problem  is  which  verbs  go  in  which  constructions  
A  Transitive  verb  mandates  that  there  has  to  be  an  object  there, sam  Devoured  the  pizza.
There  are  dozens  or  scores  of  verbs  of  this  type, each  of  which  shapes  its  sentence.
First  There's, a  level  of  fine-grained  conceptual  structure, which  we  automatically  and  unconsciously  compute  every  time  we  produce  or  utter  a  sentence  that  governs  our  use  of  language.
Or  the  meeting  went  from  three  to  four  in  which  we  conceive  of  time  as  stretched  along  a  line.
Or  rose, forced  herself  to  go  as  if  there  were  two  entities  inside  Rose's  head, engaged  in  a  Tug  of  a  war.
And  I'll  start  out  with  a  puzzle.
For  example, in  Brotherhoods  fraternal  organizations, Sororities  Locutions, like  the  family  of  man, you  try  to  get  people  who  are  not  related  to  use  the  relationship  type  that  would  ordinarily  be  appropriate  to  close  kin  
In  that  case, the  consequences  are  rather  severe  
On  the  other  hand, if  you  extend  the  bribe, if  the  officer  is  dishonest, you  get  a  huge  payoff  of  going  free  
The  honest  officer  Can't, hold  you  to  it  as  being  a  bribe.
Because  i  get  to  talk  about  one  of  my  favorite  critters, which  is  the  western  Grebe.
What  they  said  to  us  at  first  was, you  know, we  already  do  biomimicry.
And  they  said, you  know, what  happens  is  mineral  --  just  like  at  your  house  --  mineral  builds  up  
So  if  we  had  some  way  to  stop  this  scaling  --  and  so  i  picked  up  some  shells  on  the  beach, and  i  asked  them, what  is  scaling  What's  inside  your  pipes?
And  they  Didn't  know  that  
You  know, It's  a  Silo  people  in  silos. They  Didn't  know  that  the  same  thing  was  happening.
How  do  we  redesign  the  world  that  we  make  the  Human-made  world  
And  There's  a  lot  of  cool  technologies  out  there  that  life  has  
What's, the  syllabus  
And  thirdly, how  does  life  make  things  disappear  into  systems?
And  at  the  same  time, I'm  listening  to  a  lot  of  businesses  and  finding  what  their  sort  of  grand  challenges  are  
On  the  lower  left  there  is  a  picture  of  mother  of  pearl  forming  out  of  seawater, It's, a  layered  structure, That's  mineral  and  then  polymer.
Here  are  two  organisms  that  pull  water  
Pulling  water  out  of  monterey  fog  and  out  of  the  sweaty  air  in  atlanta  before  it  gets  into  a  building  are  key  technologies.
Green  chemistry  is  replacing  our  industrial  chemistry  with  Nature's  recipe  book, 
That  little  guy  over  there  is  a  tardigrade  
There  is  a  problem  with  vaccines  around  the  world, not  getting  to  patients.
They  can  be  put  in  a  glove  compartment.
Chris  anderson: talk  about  foreplay, i  --  we  need  to  get  to  12, but  really  quickly  
Ok, so  That's  the  healing, one  ,
And  really  That's  what  other  organisms  do  as  well  
That's, the  Twelfth  one  
And  i  saw  from  a  young  age  that  having  a  decent  job  and  earning  a  good  living  made  the  biggest  difference  for  families  who  were  struggling  
I  mean, here  was  a  girl  who  had  never  lived  in  peace  time  who  somehow  had  come  to  sound  like  a  candidate  from  the  apprentice  
My  first  business  was  a  Dressmaking  business.
The  imf  official  is, hardly  the  only  person  to  automatically  file  women  under  micro  
And  in  many  places, They're  there  
Because  --  and  i  say  this  as  somebody  who  worked  in  finance  --  500  billion  dollars  at  least  has  gone  into  the  emerging  markets  in  the  past  decade, 
Just  think  of  the  benefits  when  it  comes  to  jobs  productivity, employment  child, nutrition, maternal  mortality  literacy  and  much  much  more  
And  not  one  country  in  all  the  world  has  eliminated  its  economic  participation  gap  --  not  one  
The  women  in  my  family  are  not  exceptions.
The  women  in  this  room  and  watching  in  la  
Together, we  can  make  certain  that  the  so-called  exceptions  begin  to  rule  
Once  upon  a  time  in  19th  century, germany, there  was  the  book  
Now  during  this  time, the  book  was  the  king  of  storytelling, 
His  name  was  lothar.
This  man  refused  to  fold  to  the  conventions  of  Normalcy  and  just  decided  to  fold  
Whether  storytellers  realized  it  or  not, they  were  Channeling  Meggendorfer's  spirit.
And  i  really  want  to  build  green, but  I'm  very  suspicious  of  all  of  these  well-meaning  articles  people  long  on  moral  authority  and  short  on  data, telling  me  how  to  do  these  kinds  of  things  
Wipe  it  up, throw  it  away.
Unless  i  use  a  Front-loading  high-efficiency  washing  machine, and  then  it  looks  a  little  bit  better.
So  what  this  says  is  that  sometimes  the  things  that  you  least  expect  --  the  position  in  which  you  put  the  handle  --  have  a  bigger  effect  than  any  of  those  other  things  that  you  were  trying  to  optimize  
We  wanted  to  know  how  much  better  we  could  do  
Now, pvc  is  a  little  bit  better, but  still  not  as  good  as  the  wood  that  we  chose  
When  it  comes  time  to  Sheetrock, if  you  use  Ecorock  It's  about  a  quarter  of  the  embodied  energy  of  standard  Sheetrock  
If  you  put  carpeting  in  your  house  It's  about  a  tenth  of  the  embodied  energy  of  the  entire  house  unless  you  use  concrete  or  wood  for  a  much  lower  embodied  energy  
So  now  we  add  in  the  final  construction  energy, we  add  it  all  up  and  We've  built  a  house  for  less  than  half  of  the  typical  embodied  energy  for  building  a  house  like  this  
Now, i  probably  would  have  Upgraded  the  old  house  to  be  more  energy-efficient.
So  what  does  this  mean?
You  might  want  to  leave  now  
So  i  did  
And  I'm  talking  specifically  about  Synanthropic  species, which  are  species  that  have  adapted  specifically  for  human  Ecologies  species  like  rats  and  cockroaches  and  crows  
So, for  example, rats  are  incredibly  responsive  breeders, 
We're  seeing  a  population  boom  with  crows.
And  I'll  give  you  an  example  of  that  
And  these  crows  use  sticks  in  the  wild  to  get  insects  and  whatnot  out  of  pieces  of  wood  
They  messed  up  and  left  just  a  stick  of  wire  in  there.
So  What's  significant  about  this  Isn't  that  crows  are  using  cars  to  crack  nuts.
And  as  we  heard  yesterday, That's, the  Pandora's  box, That's  getting  human  beings  in  trouble  and  We're  starting  to  see  it  with  them.
Now, They're  used  to  the  sound  of  the  machine, and  they  keep  coming  back  and  digging  out  these  peanuts  from  amongst  the  pile  of  coins  That's  there  
The  main  thing, the  main  point  of  all  this  for  me  is  that  we  can  find  mutually  beneficial  systems  for  these  species.
So  my  grandfather  told  me  when  i  was  a  little  girl, if  you  say  a  word  often  enough, it  becomes  you  
Anybody  out  here  old  enough  to  know  studs  Terkel  that  old  radio, man, 
The  gradual  Slippage  --  'slippage'  is  the  word  used  by  the  people  in  watergate, moral  Slippage  --  It's, a  gradual  kind  of  thing. Combination  of  things.
Oh, let  me  kind  of  tell  you  a  funny  little  play  bit  
Just  as  a  train  is  about  to  go  a  young  couple  rush  in  and  They're, just  about  to  close  the  Pneumatic  doors  
You  see  Here's, huck  He's, an  illiterate  kid, He's  had  no  schooling, but  There's  something  in  him.
You  know, most  actors  want  to  do  characters  that  are  Likeable  --  well, not  always, but  the  notion, especially  at  a  conference  like  this, i  like  to  inspire  people  
And  i  still  feel  as  though  I've  got  to  get  coffee  for  my  male  colleagues, even  though  I've  Outlived, most  of  them  
Everything  i  do  is  word  for  word  off  a  tape  
And  it  Didn't  work  Didn't  work, 
All  around  her  head  was  just  swollen  her  head  was  about  two  sizes  of  its  own  size.
He  says, 'she, Won't  Breathe'. I   knew  immediately  that  she  was  dead.
I  Didn't  even  want  to  accept  the  fact  that  she  was  dead. So  i  went  in, and  i  put  a  mirror  to  her  mouth  --  there  was  no  thing. Nothing  coming  out  of  her  mouth.
He  said, he  said, he  said, 'we  Can't. We  Can't  let  nobody  find  out  about  This'. He  say, 'you've  got  to  help  Me'.
And  so  i  went  to  both  --  two  race  riots, one  of  which  was  the  los  angeles  riot.
And  that  trial  came  back  with  two  cops  going  to  jail  and  two  cops  declared  innocent. I   was  at  that  trial.
So  what  She's  questioning  here  She's, taking  a  chance  and  questioning  what  justice  is  in  society?
We  Didn't  qualify  for  medical  treatment, no  food  stamp, no  Gr, no  welfare.
We  Didn't  get  any  because  we  have  a  car  and  a  house  
And  i  wonder  if  that  is  really  justice  for  them  to  get  their  rights  in  that  way, 
But  after  the  riot  It's  too  much  difference, 
The  other  reason  that  i  Don't  wear  shoes  is  just  in  case, i  really  feel  like  i  have  to  cuddle  up  and  get  into  the  feet  of  somebody  walking, really  in  somebody  Else's  shoes, 
I  was  in  a  Doctor's  office  last  cat  scan.
I  mean, like  even  when  i  told  my  wife  that  you  want  to  come  out  here  and  talk  to  me  She's  like  'she's, just  talking  She's, just  being  nice  to  you  She's, not  going  to  do  That'. And  then  you  called  me  up. And  you  said, you  wanted  to  come  out  here  and  interview  me. And  she  went  and  looked  you  up  on  the  internet.
She  said, 'look  who  she  is  
Freedom, it  would  have  to  be  the  rodeo  
I  mean, i  guess  it  just  be  like  --  i  guess  it  be  like  the  day.
So  check  it  I'm  Gonna  to  catch  mockingbirds  
I'll  get  some  Asshole  at  a  watering  hole  asking  what  brand  the  ice  is  
I'll  get  the  last  time  you  lied  
I'll  get  a  lonely  little  sentence  with  real  error  in  it.
What  does  a  violin  have  to  do  with  technology?
The  surface  of  the  earth  is  absolutely  Riddled  with  holes.
I'm  on  this, 'til  the  whole  thing  spreads  with  chat  rooms  and  Copycats  and  moms, maybe  Tucking  kids  into  bed, singing  hush  little  baby  Don't, say  a  word  
Wow, 
Now, most  media  companies  --  television  radio  publishing  games, you  name  it  --  they  use  very  rigid, Segmentation  methods  in  order  to  understand  their  audiences.
And  so  the  bizarre  result  of  this  is  that  most  of  our  popular  culture  is  actually  based  on  these  Presumptions  about  our  demographics  
Now  There's  something  else  that  We've  discovered  about  social  media  That's, actually  quite  surprising  
Well, i  actually  Don't  think  That's  going  to  be  the  case.
This  is  far  too  simplistic  
So  you  may  be  asking, well, why  is  it  important  that  i  know  what  Entertains  people  
So  imagine  a  media  atmosphere  that  Isn't  dominated  by  Lame  stereotypes  about  gender  and  other  demographic  characteristics.
Thank  you  so  much  
And  she  went  to  a  neurologist, who  was  fascinated  
And  the  amazing  thing  to  me  is  that  now  you  would  think  this  woman  would  like  have  excellent  oral, hygiene, ,
I  interviewed  when  i  was  working  on  the  book, i  interviewed  a  woman  who  can  think  herself  to  orgasm  
It  was  remarkable.
And  it  is  a  fact  that  you  can  trigger  spinal  reflexes  in  dead  people  --  a  certain  kind  of  dead  person, a  Beating-heart  Cadaver  
Obviously  it  Wouldn't  be  as  much  fun  for  the  person.
You  know, you  can  get  Cadavers  if  you  work  at  a  university  
According  to  1930s  marriage, manual  author, theodoor  van  de  velde, a  slight  seminal  odor  can  be  detected  on  the  breath  of  a  woman  within  about  an  hour  after  sexual  intercourse.
But  he  wrote  in  this  book, ideal  marriage  --  he  said  that  he  could  differentiate  between  the  semen  of  a  young  man, which  he  said, had  a  fresh, exhilarating  smell  and  the  semen  of  mature  men  whose  semen  smelled  quote, remarkably  like  that  of  the  flowers  of  the  spanish  chestnut  
And  lo  and  behold, the  Hiccups  went  away  
It  was  called  the  upsuck  theory.
This  is  the  1950s  
I  have  an  answer  for  you. I   have  two  answers.
So  now  you  have  an  evolutionary  excuse  ,
Alrighty  there  is  considerable  evidence  for  upsuck  in  the  animal  kingdom  --  pigs, for  instance, 
And  i  also  said  to  her  now, these  Sows, i  mean, you  may  have  noticed  there  the  sow  Doesn't  look  to  be  in  the  Throes  of  ecstasy, 
This  is  the  Ejaculation  face  of  the  Stump-tailed  Macaque  
This  is  basically  a  penis  camera  on  a  motor  
And  in  fact, he  found  that  in  three  quarters  of  the  men, the  stuff  just  kind  of  Slopped  out  
And  that  Furthers  the  isolation  that  people  like  john  found  themselves  in  
But  after  having  lost  a  beloved  teacher  in  2006  and  a  good  friend  last  year  to  suicide  and  sitting  last  year  at  Tedactive, i  knew  that  i  needed  to  step  out  of  my  silence  and  past  my  taboos  to  talk  about  an  idea  worth  spreading  --  and  that  is  that  people  who  have  made  the  difficult  choice  to  come  back  to  life, need  more  resources  and  need  our  help  
This  is  the  way  that  most  of  us  were  taught  to  tie  our  shoes.
And  Here's  how  to  tell  
It  will  let  you  down  less  and  not  only  that  it  looks  better  
Live  long  and  Prosper  
It's  called  tidying  up  art  and  It's  as  you  can  see  It's  more  or  less  a  picture  book, 
I'd  like  to  show  them  around, so  we  can  just, you  know  --  actually, i  managed  to  prepare  for  you  some  enlarged  pictures  --  even  better  
And  we  can  see  here  very  clearly  It's, a  confusion  of  color  
The  various  pictures  here  of  the  various  elements  of  the  picture  --  the  whole  thing  is  unstructured  
Yeah, That's  great  
You  can  see  now  That's  a  good  example, even  behaving  in  an  Orderly  systematic  way  can  sometimes  lead  to  complete  chaos.
That's  a  picture  by  keith  haring  
In  the  end, one  has  a  list  with  which  one  then  can  arrange  
Tidying  up  Rene  magritte  --  this  is  really  fun  
Like  books, clothes, toothbrush, etc. And  it  was  great  .
But  then  one  morning, i  hang  the  same  little  sign  onto  that  picture  by  Vincent  van  gogh, 
Here  --  That's, just  my  new  proposal  here  for  the  union.
Yeah, i  think  after  you  have  seen  that  i  have  to  leave  anyway, 
One  is  hierarchical  pores. And  the  other  is  a  Macro-molecular  nanoscale  Porosity  in  the  material.
Machines  are  becoming  Devastatingly  capable  of  things  like  killing  right  
Those  machines  have  no  place  for  empathy.
Which  was  the  basis  of  the  movie  Bladerunner  
Even  if  you  just  try  to  get  all  of  those  ideas  into  your  head  by  watching  all  those  thousand  ted  videos, it  would  actually  currently  take  you  over  250  hours  to  do  so  
Each  of  those  tedtalks  has  an  average  length  of  about  2300  words, 
Or  living  in  existential  vacuum, it  sucks  
I  mean, 
For  example: dan  Pink's  talk  on  motivation, which  was  pretty  good.
Even  then, unfortunately  It's  not  possible  to  summarize  each  tedtalk  individually  
I  Don't  know  any  tedtalk  that  contains  this  
I  had  started  out  with  a  thousand  tedtalks, and  i  had  600  six-word  summaries  for  those  
So  i  thought, i  probably  have  to  take  this  one  step  further  here  and  create  summaries  of  the  summaries  --  and  this  is  exactly  what  i  did.
So  He's  discovering  the  garden  
His  face  by  the  way  is  fully  Ai-driven  
Now  we  need  to  have  a  bit  more  engagement.
You  stand  up  and  you  skim  the  stone  
And  We're  going  to  help  him  with  this  now, 
But  this  is  going  to  be  an  introduction.
We're  trying  to  introduce  you  to  what  i  believe  is  the  most  wonderful  part  you  being  able  to  talk  in  your  natural  voice  to  milo, 
He's  just  moved  house, He's  got  no  friends, 
They're  always  getting  stressed  
Milo, i  just  really  miss  my  old  house  That's  all  
But  for  me, this  is  a  wonderful  opportunity  where  technology  at  last  can  be  connected  with  where  i  am  no  longer  Restrained  by  the  finger.
Each  of  you  Possesses  the  most  powerful  dangerous  and  subversive  trait  that  natural  selection  has  ever  devised  
I'm  talking  about  your  language, of  course, because  it  allows  you  to  implant  a  thought  from  your  mind  directly  into  someone  Else's  mind, and  they  can  attempt  to  do  the  same  to  you  without  either  of  you  having  to  perform  surgery.
And  just  imagine  the  sense  of  wonder  in  a  baby  when  it  first  discovers  that  merely  by  Uttering  a  sound, it  can  get  objects  to  move  across  a  room  as  if  by  magic  and  maybe  even  into  its  mouth.
And  this  cumulative  cultural  adaptation  as  anthropologists  call  this  accumulation  of  ideas  is  responsible  for  everything  around  you  in  your  bustling  and  teeming  everyday  lives.
And  this  is  also  true  of  some  remote  oceanic  islands  
This  remarkable  image  is  not  a  map  of  the  world.
He  thought, oh, i  can  renovate  the  school  
She  found  a  job, she  Scouted  for  jobs  for  her  classmates  and  her  friends  
She  not  only  changed  her  own  dynamic. She  changed  her  household.
And  that  is  that  the  central  moral  challenge  of  this  century  is  gender, inequity, 
So  some  of  you  may  be  thinking, gosh, That's, hyperbole, 
And  you  know, it  happens  for  several  reasons.
There  are  three  reasons  why  this  is  the  case.
When  you  educate  a  girl, she  tends  to  have  significantly  fewer  kids.
It's, kind  of  like  the  dirty  little  secret  of  poverty, which  is  that  not  only  do  poor  people  take  in  very  little  income. But  also  the  income  that  they  take  in. They  Don't  spend  it  very  wisely. And  unfortunately, most  of  that  spending  is  done  by  men.
The  last  reason  has  to  do  with  women  being  part  of  the  solution, not  the  problem  
He  was  speaking  to  an  audience, much  like  yourselves, 
And  that  does  not  even  include  those  that  are  trafficked  within  country  borders, which  is  a  substantial  portion.
She  fought  off  the  hyenas  with  that  stick  
She's  moved  out  of  a  vicious  cycle  and  into  a  virtuous  cycle.
Let  me  tell  you  about  saima  
And  then, when  she  had  to  transport  all  of  the  embroidery  goods  from  the  village  to  the  marketplace, she  needed  someone  to  help  her  do  the  transport.
A  few  yards  away  was  a  failed  chicken  coop  
She  never  broke  down  
So  Here's  the  cause  
Join  the  movement  
You've  all  seen  lots  of  articles  on  climate  change  and  Here's  yet  another  new  york  times  article  just  like  every  other  darn  one  You've, seen  
And  We've  accomplished  close  to  zip  
And  there  are  times, you  might  like  to  do  something  quick  
Can  you  shade  some  sunlight  and  effectively  compensate  for  the  added  co2  and  produce  a  climate  sort  of  back  to  what  it  was  originally  
And  the  answer  seems  to  be, yes, 
It  just  sunk  below  the  surface. We  Weren't  allowed  to  speak  about  it.
And  in  fact, he  had  some  ideas  to  make  them  go  away.
But  Let's  say, you  have  sunlight  hitting  some  particle  and  It's  Unevenly, heated  ,
So  the  side  facing  the  sun  is  warmer  the  side  away.
And  so  you  see  a  net  force  away  from  the  sun  
Because  we  have  no  way  to  agree  about  where  to  set  the  knobs  
We  need  a  broader  debate.
Let's  say  that  we  Don't  do  geo-engineering, we  do  what  we  ought  to  do, which  is  get  serious  about  cutting  emissions.
But  i  have  a  lot  of  reservations  
And  It's  time  to  begin  thinking  about  it, even  if  the  reason  We're  thinking  about  it  is  to  construct  arguments  for  why  we  Shouldn't  do  it  
And  oddly, the  most  notable  letter  of  Rejection  i  ever  received  came  from  walt  disney  world, a  seemingly  Innocuous  site  
And  i  wanted  to  see  the  center  with  my  own  eyes. But  what  i  came  away  with  is  a  photograph.
And  It's  just  another  place  from  which  to  observe  and  the  understanding  that  there  are  no  absolute  All-knowing, Insiders  
In  this  context, I'll  just  show  you  a  few  
This  is  a  Cryopreservation  unit, and  it  holds  the  bodies  of  the  wife  and  mother  of  cryonics  pioneer  robert  Ettinger  who  hoped  to  be  Awoken  one  day  to  extended  life  in  good  health  with  advancements  in  science  and  technology, all  for  the  cost  of  35  thousand  dollars  for  forever.
And  in  this, i  really  wanted  it  to  resemble  an  early  Still-life  painting.
And  the  film  was  shot  on  72  millimeter.
I  investigate  Photography's  ability  to  blur  truth  and  fiction  and  its  influence  on  memory, which  can  lead  to  severe  even  lethal  consequences  
A  victim  or  eyewitness  identifies  a  suspected  perpetrator  through  law, Enforcement's  use  of  images  
But  through  exposure  to  composite  sketches, Polaroids, Mug  shots  and  Line-ups, eyewitness  testimony  can  change  
And  he  served  10  years  of  a  life  sentence.
Ron  Williamson  ron  was  convicted  of  the  rape  and  murder  of  a  Barmaid  at  a  club  and  served  11  years  of  a  death  sentence.
Ronald  jones  served  eight  years  of  a  death  sentence  for  rape  and  murder  of  a  28-year-old  woman: 
Some  people  say  this  is  because  we  have  better  diagnosis  and  more  people  are  being  found  out  
For  example, these  two  show  great  growth  in  income, absolutely  flat  happiness.
My  field  the  field  of  psychology, Hasn't  done  a  whole  lot  to  help  us  move  forward  in  understanding  human  happiness.
Emotions  are  short-lived  intense  responses  to  challenge  and  to  opportunity.
And  each  one  of  them  allows  us  to  click  into  alternate  selves  that  tune  in  turn  on  drop  out, thoughts, perceptions, feelings  and  memories.
We've  come  away  from  the  freudian  gloom, and  people  are  now  actively  studying  this  
Absent  from  this  list  and  absent  from  any  discussions  of  happiness  are  happiness  in  Another's  happiness, 
Babies  love, the  taste  of  sweet  and  hate  the  taste  of  bitter  
Babies  really  are  born  with  a  lot  of  innate  pleasures  
It  turned  out  that  it  Wasn't  that  it  really  is  a  system  of  motivation.
There  is  a  profound  need  to  belong.
But  there  are  ways  in  which  our  evolutionary  history  can  really  trip  us  up.
So, for  example, we  have  three  systems  that  Underlie  reproduction  because  It's  so  important  
There's  attachment, which  is  oxytocin.
So  a  person  can  be  in  a  long  term. Attachment  become  romantically  Infatuated  with  someone  else  and  want  to  have  sex  with  a  third  person.
So  if  you  look  at  questions  like  this  life  satisfaction  you  see  life  satisfaction  going  up  with  each  rung  of  income.
You  see  mental  distress  going  up  with  lower  income, 
But  the  effect  is  relatively  small  
And  sure  enough, if  you  look  at  the  kinds  of  values  that  come  in, you  see  wealth  adventure  achievement, pleasure, fun, be  respected  before  the  change  and  much  more  Post-materialist  values  after  ,
I  had  all  kinds  of  rats: mice  Hamsters, Gerbils, squirrels  
Growing  up  in  a  multicultural  environment, we  had  african  students  in  the  house, and  i  learned  about  their  stories.
Princess, diana  is  announcing  on  tv  that  landmines  form  a  structural  barrier  to  any  development, which  is  really  true  
And  actually  our  product  --  what  you  see  here, 
Rats  have  been  used  since  the  '50s  last  century  in  all  kinds  of  experiments.
Rats  have  more  genetic  material  allocated  to  Olfaction  than  any  other  mammal  species, 
So  in  our  common  language, dutch  the  name  for  tb  
It  gets  a  click  sound  and  comes  for  the  food  reward.
And  by  doing  so  very  fast, we  can  have  like  a  second-line  opinion  to  see  which  patients  are  positive, which  are  negative  
Just  as  an  indication, whereas  a  Microscopist  can  process  40  samples  in  a  day.
But  Let's  stick  first  to  tuberculosis  
Throughout  last  year, We've  been  --  depending  on  which  intervals  you  take  --  We've  been  consistently, increasing  case  detection  rates  in  five  hospitals  in  Dar  es  salaam  between  30  and  40  percent  
And  there  are  simple  things  like, for  instance, we  have  a  small  laser  in  the  Sniffer  hole  where  the  animal  has  to  stick  for  five  seconds.
Also  to  standardize  the  pellets, the  food  rewards  and  to  Semi-automate  this, in  order  to  replicate  this  on  a  much  larger  scale  and  affect  the  lives  of  many  more  people  
Here  is  a  first  prototype  of  our  camera  rat, which  is  a  rat  with  a  rat  backpack  with  a  camera  that  can  go  under  rubble  to  detect  for  victims  after  earthquake  and  so  on  
Thank  you  very  much  
So, how  do  you  go  about  studying  the  brain  
Now, one  recent  discovery  that  has  been  made  by  researchers  in  italy  in  Parma  by  Giacomo  Rizzolatti  and  his  colleagues  is  a  group  of  neurons  called  mirror  neurons, which  are  on  the  front  of  the  brain  in  the  frontal  lobes.
So  here  is  a  neuron  that  fires  when  i  reach  and  grab  something.
It's  almost, as  though  It's  performing  a  virtual  reality  simulation  of  the  other  Person's  action, 
For  one  thing  they  must  be  involved  in  things  like  imitation  and  emulation  
So  how  do  you  do  imitation?
And  i  claim  that  what  happened  was  the  sudden  emergence  of  a  sophisticated  mirror  neuron  system, which  allowed  you  to  emulate  and  imitate  other  People's  actions.
A  human  being  a  child  can  just  watch  its  parent, kill  another  polar  bear  and  skin  it  and  put  the  skin  on  its  body  fur  on  the  body  and  learn  it  in  one  step. What  the  polar  bear  took  100000  years  to  learn?
It  emerges  from  our  understanding  of  basic  neuroscience, 
For  the  longest  time  people  have  regarded  science  and  humanities  as  being  distinct  
Pollen  is  a  Flower's  way  of  making  more  flowers  
Here  is  a  scanning  electron  Micrograph  of  a  grain  of  pollen  
The  little  hole  in  the  middle  We'll  come  to  a  bit  later, but  That's  for  the  pollen  tube  to  come  out  later  on  a  very  tiny  tube  
So  That's, 20  Micrometers  across  that  pollen  grain, there  
It's  also, very  biologically  active  as  anyone  with  hay  fever  will  understand  
And  the  reason  for  that  is  They've  got  to  chuck  out  masses  and  masses  of  pollen  to  have  any  chance  of  the  pollen  reaching  another  plant  of  the  same  species.
Again  --  this  time, Sycamore  --  Wind-dispersed  
Cool.
Remember  that  thing  is  just  about  30  Micrometers  across  
Now  It's  much  more  efficient  if  you  can  get  insects  to  do  your  bidding  
The  pollen  has  little  barbs  on  it.
That  tells  me  that  It's  actually  been  fossilized  this  pollen  
Isn't  that  cool  
And  this  is  where  it  gets  interesting  for  forensics  
So  not  only  does  each  type  of  pollen  look  different. But  each  habitat  has  a  different  combination  of  plants.
This  is  some  pollen  embedded  in  a  cotton  shirt  similar  to  the  one  that  I'm  wearing  now  
And  that  is  the  40  years  that  women  have  advocated  
We  have  effective  therapies  now  
Why  are  more  and  more  women  dying  of  Ischemic  heart  disease, 
So  in  the  wise  15  years  ago, we  started  out  and  said, well, wow, There's  a  couple  of  key  observations, and  we  should  probably  follow  up  on  that  
Had  recently  published  that  when  women  have  heart  attacks  and  die, compared  to  men  who  have  heart  attacks  and  die  --  and  again, this  is  millions  of  people  happening  every  day  --  women  in  their  fatty  plaque  --  and  this  is  their  Coronary  artery.
Ekg  goes  Pbbrrhh.
So  what  do  you  think  happens  to  these  Gals  
So, unlike  the  cat  scans, x-rays, Thalliums  for  women  whose  breast  is  in  the  way  of  looking  at  the  heart  every  time  we  order  something  that  has  even  a  small  amount  of  radiation. We  say, do  we  really  need  that  test?
And  those  little  red  boxes  are  deaths  
One  of  the  things  that  we  say  about  all  of  this  female  physiology  --  because  again, as  much  as  We're  talking  about  women  and  heart  disease, women  do  on  average  have  better  longevity  than  men  --  is  that  unfolding  the  secrets  of  female  physiology  and  understanding  that  is  going  to  help  men  and  women  
So  We're  35  years  behind  
Women  participate  
Deb  roy  this  moment  and  thousands  of  other  moments  special  for  us  were  captured  in  our  home  because  in  every  room  in  the  house, if  you  looked  up  You'd, see  a  camera  and  a  microphone.
This  is  my  wife  and  i  cooking  breakfast  in  the  kitchen.
In  order  to  convert  this  opaque  90000  hours  of  video  into  something  that  we  could  start  to  see  we  use  motion  analysis  to  pull  out  as  we  move  through  space.
No  video  here.
This  is  one  of  the  first  results  that  came  out  of  our  study  a  little  over  a  year  ago  that  really  surprised  us  
So  it  appears  that  all  three  primary  caregivers  --  myself, my  wife  and  our  nanny  --  were  systematically. And  i  would  think  subconsciously  Restructuring  our  language  to  meet  him  at  the  birth  of  a  word  and  bring  him  gently  into  more  complex  language.
What  about  the  visual  context  
And  There's  our  nanny  by  the  door, 
And  what  We've  done  is  use  the  word  water  to  tag  that  moment  that  bit  of  activity  
Three  of  the  key  people  in  this  project, philip  Decamp, rony, Kubat  and  brandon  roy  are  pictured  here  
Each  of  the  links  that  You're  seeing  rendered  here  is  an  actual  connection  made  between  something  someone  said  and  a  piece  of  content  
We  call  this  a  Co-viewing  Clique, a  virtual  living  room  if  you  will  
And  there  are  fascinating  dynamics  at  play  
So  this  person  is  a  key  link  in  connecting  mass  media  and  social  media  together  
Come  here  
Oh  boy, 
And  primary  visual  cortex  sees  just  simple  geometry, just  the  simplest  of  shapes  
And  this  is  the  part  of  the  brain  that  will  recognize  what  something  is

You  can  see  the  Three-light  Transom  there  with  the  eyebrow  windows  --  certainly  an  architectural  antique  headed  to  the  landfill.
Even  the  Lockset  is  probably  worth  200  dollars.
Then  looking  up  in  the  turret, you  see  there  are  Bulges  and  Pokes  and  Sags  and  so  forth.

But  once  in  a  while, you  get  access  to  the  control  room, and  then  you  can  kind  of  mess  with  the  dials  
How  disgusting  
It's  a  pretty  quick  read  
But  as  soon  as  you  walk  in, i  go  ooh  spaghetti  sauce  there.
I  feel  that  expectation. And  so  i  accommodate  it  and  I'm  living  my  life  according  to  what  you  expect  me  to  do.
Wildebeests  Don't  hang  with  lions  because  lions  eat  Wildebeests  
And  so  you  see  this  in  junior  high, a  lot  
On  the  bottom  Tier, we  have  basic  needs  --  shelter, clothing, food, water, mating  and  so  forth.
We  Can't  even  afford  to  eat  anything  except  beans  
We're  in  trouble, 
And  it  raises  an  existential  question, which  is  if  I'm  having  this  experience  of  complete  connection  and  full  consciousness. Why  am  i  not  visible  in  the  photograph?
This  is  a  police  photo  That's, actually, my  car  
I'm  put  on  full  life  support, and  i  have  a  massive  stroke, and  my  brain  drops  into  a  coma.

If  i  ask  you  tomorrow  to  put  one  grain  of  sand  between  your  teeth  and  go  for  a  nice  long  walk, how  far  would  you  last  before?
That  tiny  Misalignment  
Bear  in  mind, there  are  no  nerves  in  the  teeth.
That's, why  the  same  between  the  before? And  after  that, this  shows  It's  hard  to  see  the  difference.
This  is  an  mri  Mra  Mrv, a  volumetric  mri

Because  the  chimpanzee  would  score  half  right, if  i  gave  them  two  bananas  with  sri  lanka  and  turkey, they  would  be  right.
I  did  also  an  unethical  study  of  the  professors  of  the  karolinska  institute  --  that  hands  out  the  nobel  prize  in  medicine, and  they  are  on  Par  with  the  chimpanzee.
Well, i  first  discovered  that  the  textbook  was  Tintin, mainly  ,
And  what  do  you  mean  with  western  world?
And  1962, there  was  really  a  group  of  countries  here  that  was  industrialized  countries, and  they  had  small  families  and  long  lives.
One  dollar  10  dollars  or  100  dollars  per  day  
There's  a  little  hump  here, but  there  are  people  all  the  way.
We  heard  it  in  other  forms, and  who  are  these  
Where  are  the  different  countries?
The  problem  in  the  world  was  the  poverty  in  asia. And  if  i  now  let  the  world  move  forward, you  will  see  that  while  population  increase  there  are  hundreds  of  millions  in  asia, getting  out  of  poverty  and  some  others  getting  into  poverty. And  this  is  the  pattern  we  have  today.
I  can  go  here, and  i  can  split  sub-saharan  africa  into  its  countries.

But  wilkins, you  know, thought, dna  was  the  best  bet, and  he  showed  this  x-ray  photograph, 
And  there  i  met  francis  crick  
I  went  there  without  knowing  him, he  was  35.
And  within  a  day  we  had  decided  that  maybe  we  could  take  a  shortcut  to  finding  the  structure  of  dna  
And  the  reason  for  doing  so  at  the  center  of  this  photograph  is  linus  pauling  about  six  months  before  he  proposed  the  alpha  Helical  structure  for  proteins  and  in  doing.
This  is  a  photograph  several  years  later  when  Bragg  had  cause  to  smile  
And  they  had  the  wisdom  to  say, no, so  he  Didn't  have  it  
But  there  was  ones  in  the  literature.
So  this  was, you  know, unexpected  from  the  World's  --  --  and  so  it  was  held  together  by  hydrogen  bonds  between  Phosphate  groups.
And  a  month  after  we  got  the  pauling  manuscript  --  i  should  say, i  took  the  manuscript  to  london  and  showed  the  people  
Well, we  got  the  answer  on  the  28th, february  '53  
So  i  changed  the  locations. And  then  we  found  the  base  pairing. And  francis  immediately  said, the  chains  run  in  absolute  directions.
So  we  saw  how  genetic  information  is  carried.
It  Didn't  yield: it  Didn't  give  good  x-ray  photographs, 
It  was  really, you  know, sort  of  a  Shitty  time.
Well  at  that  time  --  i  should  go  back  
And  then  they  learned  how  to  read  the  letters  for  the  code.
There's  a  chip  there, a  conventional  one, then  There's  one  made  by  a  Photolithography  by  a  company  in  madison  called  Nimblegen, which  is  way  ahead  of  Affymetrix  
And  we  use  their  technique  
Which  is  all  of  us  have  about  10  places  in  our  genome  where  We've  lost  a  gene  or  gained  another  one  
Actually  It's  a  really  big  idea.
And  they  were  going  to  spend  the  rest  of  their  lives, usually  in  this  iron  lung  to  breathe  for  them.
And  it  happened  so  fast  in  the  united  states, however, that  even  just  last  month, jon  stewart  said  this, jon, stewart.
They  had  come  from  thousands  of  miles  away.
It  Doesn't  survive  in  the  environment, hardly  at  all  
And  We've  got  pretty  good  vaccines  as  I've  just  showed  you  
So  those  are  the  kind  of  stakes  that  We're  after  
So  it  was  a  massive  effort.
We've  had  to  create  one  of  the  largest  social  movements  in  history.
Now  giving  the  polio  vaccine  is  simple  
Now  it  took  years  to  build  up  the  infrastructure  for  polio  eradication  --  more  than  15  years, much  longer  than  it  should  have  --  but  once  it  was  built, the  results  were  striking  
Last  year  it  was  1000  
We  should  abandon  this  idea  of  eradication  
Let's: settle  for  control  --  That's  good  enough, 
Umar  was  paralyzed  for  life.
As  you  probably  Can't, see  the  detail  here. But  this  is  his  report  card.
But  you  know, I'd  love  to  be  able  to  tell  you  that  umar  is  a  typical  kid  with  polio  these  days, but  It's, not  true  
The  new  vaccine  had  twice  the  impact  on  these  last  couple  of  viruses  as  the  old  vaccine  had.
Well, in  a  couple  of  months, we  had  to  get  it  out  of  production.
And  we  Didn't  start  with  the  easy  places.
So  this  morning  at  about  seven  o'clock, i  decided  that  We'd  try  to  drive  chris  and  the  production  crew  here  berserk  by  downloading  all  of  our  data  from  india  again, so  that  you  could  see  something  That's  just  unfolding  today, which  proves  that  the  impossible  is  possible.
Today, marks  exactly  six  months  --  and  for  the  first  time  in  history, not  a  single  child  has  been  paralyzed  in  uttar  pradesh, or  bihar  
We  have  the  chance  to  write  an  entirely  new  Polio-free  chapter  in  human  history.
Beverly  Joubert, we  are  truly  passionate  about  the  african  wilderness  and  protecting  the  african  wilderness.
But  one  of  the  things  that  science  really  lets  us  down  on  is  that  personality  that  individual  personality  that  these  animals  have  
Well, we  Needn't  have  worried  
And  we  could  only  find  this  by  pushing  ourselves  by  going  where  no  sane  person  should  go  --  not  without  some  Prompting  by  the  way  from  beverly  --  and  just  pushing  the  envelope, going  out  there  pushing  our  vehicle  pushing  ourselves, 
We  Don't  always  get  that  right.
But  That's, i  think  what  this  is  all  about  is  that  these  individuals  have  these  personalities  and  characters  
Sleep.
But  for  10  years, we  tried  to  capture  lions  and  elephants  together  --  and  never  ever  managed  until  this  particular  night  
This  elephant  against  overwhelming  odds  simply  gives  up  hope  
But  by  the  same  token, you  can  get  your  hope  back  again.
Beverly  sits  on  the  one  side  where  all  her  camera  gear  is  and  I'm  on  the  other  side, where  my  space  is  
These  are  precious  to  us  these  divides  
But  when  this  little  cub  saw  that  i  had  Vacated  my  seat  and  climbed  to  the  back  to  get  some  camera  gear, she  came  in  like  a  curious  cat  to  come  and  investigate  
And  of  course, we  knew  now  that  she  was  going  to  survive  
It  was  absolutely  amazing  when  she  picked  it  up  to  safety  protecting  it  from  the  hyena  
But  i  have  to  tell  you  --  everybody  always  asks  what  happened  to  the  baby  baboon  
We  had  to  deal  with  these  individual  personalities  
There's  an  immense  amount  of  poaching  as  well.
Richard  feynman  compared  the  accuracy  of  quantum  theories  --  experimental  predictions  --  to  specifying  the  width  of  north  america  to  within  one  Hair's  breadth  of  accuracy, 
And  the  familiar  illustration  is  the  nucleus  of  an  atom  is  a  fly  in  the  middle  of  a  sports  stadium.
As  an  evolutionary  biologist, I'd  say  this  our  brains  have  evolved  to  help  us  survive  within  the  orders  of  magnitude  of  size  and  speed, which  our  bodies  operate  at. We  never  evolved  to  navigate  in  the  world  of  atoms.
Moving  to  the  other  end  of  the  scale, our  ancestors  never  had  to  navigate  through  the  cosmos  at  speeds  close  to  the  speed  of  light. If  they  had  our  brains  would  be  much  better  at  understanding  einstein. I   want  to  give  the  name  middle  world  to  the  Medium-scaled  environment  in  which  We've  evolved  the  ability  to  take  act  --  nothing  to  do  with  middle  earth.
He  stared  at  his  wall  in  Arlington  virginia  and  decided  to  do  it  
Then  general  Stubblebine  banged, his  nose  hard  on  the  wall  of  his  office. Stubblebine, who  commanded  16000  soldiers  was  Confounded  by  his  continual  failure  to  walk  through  the  wall.
I  have  every  reason  to  think  It's  true, i  was  reading  playboy  because  i  myself  had  an  article  in  it.
And  That's  because  in  middle  world, air  friction  is  always  there  
We  have  this  tendency  to  think  that  only  solid  material  things  are  really  things  at  all  waves  of  electromagnetic  fluctuation, in  a  vacuum  seem  unreal  
Steve  grand  points  out  that  you  and  i  are  ourselves  more  like  a  wave  than  a  permanent  thing.
After  all, you  really  were  there  at  the  time.
Not  a  single  atom  that  is  in  your  body  today, was  there  when  that  event  took  place  matter  flows  from  place  to  place  and  Momentarily  comes  together  to  be  you  
So  really  Isn't  a  word  that  we  should  use  with  simple  confidence.
The  fact  that  the  bat  uses  echoes  in  pitch  darkness  to  input, the  current  variables  to  its  model  while  the  swallow  uses  light  is  Incidental  
Haldane  guesses  that  a  dog  would  probably  be  able  to  place  the  acids  in  the  order  of  their  molecular  weights  by  their  smells, just  as  a  man  could  place  a  number  of  piano  wires  in  the  order  of  their  lengths  by  means  of  their  notes  
We're  blind  to  all  frequencies  outside  that, unless  we  use  instruments  to  help  us  
One  way  to  think  about  that  is  by  counting  planets, 
In  short, when  We're  thinking  like  academics, we  regard  people  as  elaborate  and  complicated  machines  like  computers  or  cars.
Personification  and  the  Imputing  of  intentional  purpose  is  such  a  brilliantly  successful  way  to  model.
And  so  this  basically  led  me  to  a  subject  called  cymatics  
Now, cymatics  is  the  process  of  visualizing  sound  by  basically  vibrating  a  medium, such  as  sand  or  water, as  you  can  see  there.
So  what  excites  me  about  cymatics  
It's  like  a  looking  glass  into  a  hidden  world, 
We  can  also  use  cymatics  for  healing  and  education.
This  image  here  is  created  from  a  Snippet  of  Beethoven's  ninth  symphony, playing  through  a  cymatic  device.
And  we  can  evolve  this  exploration  of  the  substance  of  things  not  seen.
The  war  in  vietnam  was  raging. The  civil  rights  movement  was  under  way  and  pictures  had  a  powerful  influence  on  me.
I  believed  the  photographers  and  so  did  millions  of  other  americans.

Narrator: a  word  about  galvao, a  very  rare  kind  of  bird  native  to  brazil  
Now, most  of  you  have  figured  out  that  this  was  a  prank  and  actually  a  very, very  good  one  
Because  what  happens  on  a  social  network  is  you  interact  with  the  people  that  you  have  chosen  to  interact  with  
And  the  reason  it  Shouldn't  be  is  that  on  any  day, you  can  go  into  trending  topics.
Now, for  me, I'm  surprised  by  this, because  this  Wasn't  how  the  internet  was  supposed  to  be  
We're  heading  to  the  future  of  bits  where  everything  is  Speedy, It's, weightless  
Here's  what  i  think  is  going  on  
It  includes  things  like  the  internet  cables  
When  we  stop  looking  at  the  infrastructure  that  makes  connection  possible, and  we  look  at  what  actually  happens.
That's  down  to  about  12  to  15  percent  
Even  within  Wikipedias, where  We're  creating  their  own  content, online  There's, a  heavy  bias  towards  the  place  where  a  lot  of  the  wikipedia  authors  are  based  rather  than  to  the  rest  of  the  world.
You  probably  Won't  
This  is  a  team  of  bloggers  from  around  the  world.
But  the  more  that  i  think  about  it, the  more  that, i  think  that  a  few  things  that  we  have  learned  along  the  way  are  interesting  lessons  for  how  we  would  rewire.
In  this  case  --  the  map  of  the  world  at  night  by  nasa  --  They're, dark, literally  because  of  lack  of  electricity, 
I'm  also  guessing  that  most  of  you  Don't  even  speak  chinese  --  which  is  sort  of  sad. If  you  think  about  it  as  It's.
They  put  it  online  for  free  
My  guess  is, at  least  one  of  them  has  something  interesting  to  say, 
And  search  is  terrific.
She  has  to  know  something  about  what  stories  are  available.
I  know, Amira  
He  knows  one  world  and  He's  finding  a  way  to  communicate  it  to  another  world, both  of  which  he  has  deep  connections  to  
And  the  house  that  john  Wilkes  booth  planned  the  Assassination  of  abraham  lincoln  is  actually  also  now  a  chinese  restaurant  called  wok  'n, roll  on  h  street  in  washington, 
The  short  answer  is  actually  They're  from  japan  
The  original  name  in  my  book  was  actually  called  the  long  march  of  general  tso. And  he  has  marched  very  far  indeed, because  he  is  sweet.
He's  retired  deaf  and  plays  a  lot  of  Mahjong  
But  in  china, this  Guy's  actually  known  for  war  and  not  chicken  
I  like  to  say, chop  Suey's, the  biggest  culinary  joke  that  one  culture  has  ever  played  on  another  because  chop  suey.
Now  back, then  the  americans  were  not  Clamoring  to  eat  chinese  food.
There  is  west  indian  chinese  food, There's, Jamaican  chinese  food.
This  is  a  dish  called  magic  bowl  that  i  discovered  
They  actually  did  so  through  a  centralized  headquarters  out  of  illinois, right?
It  Wasn't  that  so  They're  like, ok, Let's  look  at  television.
Now, i  Don't  have  a  tv, which  makes  me  a  freak, but  very  productive.
This  actually  is  a  slip  that  one  of  the  winners  had  because  the  tennessee  lottery  security  officials  were  like.
Yeah, so  i  went  and  started  looking  
It  was  lunch; it  was  Take-out. It  was  Sit-down. It  was  buffet. It  was  three  weeks  ago. It  was  three  months  ago.
This  time  I'm  going  to  talk  about  mental  illness, 
Not  only  would  it  lift, but  it  might  never  return  
That  always  makes  hair  stand  up  and  people  shake  a  lot  
So  they  went  to  the  police, and  they  said, we  know  that  at  the  rome  railroad  station. There  are  all  these  lost  souls  wandering  around  muttering  Gibberish.
That's  not  going  to  do  anything  terrible  to  him.
Well, you  know, in  the  middle  '60s, the  first  antidepressants  came  out.
Finally, i  would  schedule  --  all  my  major  surgical  cases, i  was  Scheduling  them  for  12, one  o'clock  in  the  afternoon, because  i  Couldn't  get  out  of  bed  before  about  11  o'clock  
And  my  colleagues  who  had  known  me  since  medical  school  in  that  place, said, Don't  worry  chap, six  weeks, You're  back  in  the  operating  room, Everything's  going  to  be  great  
You've  seen  this  painting  by  Edvard  Munch, the  scream, every  moment  was  a  scream.
Well, as  in  all  hospitals, there  was  a  resident  assigned  to  my  case  he  was  27  years  old, and  he  would  meet  with  me  two  or  three  times  a  week.
Any  of  the  results  along  the  spectrum  from  pretty  bad  to  terrible  terrible  terrible  is  going  to  happen  if  he  does  the  best  he  can. He  will  have  no  further  obsessions  probably  no  depression, but  his  affect  will  be  Dulled. He  will  never  go  back  to  surgery. He  will  never  be  the  loving  father  that  he  was  to  his  two  children. His  life  will  be  changed  if  he  has  the  usual  result. He  will  end  up  like  'one  flew  over  the  Cuckoo's  Nest'.
Plugged  me  into  the  wires, put  me  to  sleep, gave  me  the  muscle  Relaxant  
But  lo  and  behold, by  16, by  17, there  were  Demonstrable  differences  in  the  way  i  felt  
It  was, as  though  those  tightly  Coiled  wires  in  my  head  had  been  disconnected.
My  children  came  back  to  live  with  us.
We  had  two  more  children  after  that  
It's  been  as  i  said, close  to  30  years.
Every  once  in  a  while, i  get  somewhat  depressed  and  a  little  obsessional  
And  I've  always  felt  guilty  about  that  
I  hope  it  happens  to  none  of  you, but  it  will  probably  happen  to  a  small  percentage  of  you  
Would  you  describe  that  as  global  citizenship  
I  believe  the  concept  of  global  citizenship  will  simply  grow  out  of  people  talking  to  each  other  across  continents, 
But  people  get  excited  about  this  idea  of  global  citizenship, but  then  they  get  confused  a  bit  again  when  they  start  thinking  about  patriotism  and  how  to  combine  these  two  
When  you  actually  look  at  the  motor  of  the  world  economy, it  Cannot  move  forward  unless  there  is  trade  between  the  different  countries.
Well, i  think  we  can  persuade  people  that  what  is  necessary  for  Britain's, long-term  interests. What  is  necessary  for  America's, long-term  interests  is  proper  engagement  with  the  rest  of  the  world  and  taking  the  action  that  is  necessary.
And  we  have  got  to  realize  that  if  we  Don't  link  up  with  those  people  who  are  sensible  voices  and  democratic  voices  in  africa  to  work  together  for  common  causes  then  the  danger  of  al  qaeda  and  related  groups  making  progress  in  africa  is  very  big  
And  i  Wouldn't  like  anything  that  is  said, today  to  suggest  that  i  am  diminishing  the  importance  of  the  responsibility  that  each  individual  leader  has  for  their  own  country, 
Where  was  the  early  warning  systems?
All  these  things  have  happened.
Even  if  as  a  human  being, you  believe  that  you  Can't  say  that  You're  elected  for  Britain's  interests, 
Since  then  the  world  has  moved  forward, partly  as  a  result  of  what  happened  with  the  holocaust  and  People's  concern  about  the  rights  of  individuals  within  territories  where  they  need  protection, partly  because  of  what  we  saw  in  rwanda, partly  because  of  what  we  saw  in  bosnia  
The  idea  of  the  responsibility  to  protect  all  individuals  who  are  in  situations  where  they  are  at  humanitarian  risk  is  now  being  established  as  a  principle, which  governs  the  world.
So  while  i  Can't  automatically  say  that  britain  will  rush  to  the  aid  of  any  citizen  of  any  country  in  danger. I   can  say  that  britain  is  in  a  position  where  We're  working  with  other  countries. So  that  this  idea  that  you  have  a  responsibility  to  protect  people  who  are  victims  of  either  genocide  or  humanitarian  attack  is  something  that  is  accepted  by  the  whole  world.
Yes, and  then, of  course, the  theory  is  still  that  those  talks  get  rent  apart  by  different  countries  fighting  over  their  own  individual  interests, 
America  has  made  its  first  Disposition  on  this  with  the  bill  that  president  obama  should  be  Congratulated  for  getting  through  congress.
And  god  shook  his  head  and  said, not  this  year, not  this  decade, perhaps  not  even  in  your  lifetime.
And  bill  clinton  walked  away  in  tears, because  he  had  failed  to  get  what  he  wanted  
So  That's  kind  of  a  bold  statement, 
And  It's  technological, so  it  can  do  things  like  microelectronics  and  maybe  Photonics  do  
And  the  material  looks  something  like  this  
The  process  of  discovery  generally  is  inspired  by  nature.
They  find  their  way  to  self-assemble  
And  we  can  store  information  That's  film  with  water  and  protein  
You  can  imagine  that  then  maybe  you  can  use  a  pure  protein  to  guide  light. And  so  We've  made  optical  fibers.
You  can  do  electronic  pieces  that  fold  and  wrap  
You  can  implant  it  in  the  body  without  needing  to  retrieve  what  is  implanted  
And  you  see  there, it  gets  Reintegrated  in  tissue.
So  you  have  a  clock  you  have  protein.
So  it  allows  for  the  recovery  of  what  We've  stored  before  
Some  people  in  the  last  decade  or  two  have  started  creating  artwork  with  technology.
You  can  learn  something  from  the  robot  about  the  community  that  You're  in  
You  guys  are  looking  good  out  there.
Data  Here's: the  first  one  
One  of  them  falls  to  the  ground  
I  can  help  
You've  been  a  great  audience: 
There's  a  lot  more  to  come  
Then  he  said, but  really  sarah, you  could  have  worked  harder. Can't.
Indeed, It's  rather  small  
One  day  while  my  father  was  working  on  a  file  for  us  to  obtain  french  nationality, i  happened  to  see  some  documents  that  caught  my  attention.
These  are  real  
So  his  story, my  father  was  born  in  argentina, 
This  coincided  with  the  time  when  he  threw  himself  body  and  soul  into  chemistry, because  it  was  the  only  consolation  for  his  sadness.
It  was  my  grandfather  who  decided  they  needed  false  documents.
But  it  was  he  who  went  to  meet  a  man  from  the  resistance.
In  those  times  documents  had  hard  covers. They  were  filled  in  by  hand, and  they  stated  your  job.
He  started  inventing  all  kind  of  things  --  with  some  materials. He  invented  a  centrifuge  using  a  bicycle  wheel.
Time  passed  and  they  thought  he  had  surely  forgotten  them  at  first  
And  then  i  understood  that  asking  my  father, so  many  questions  was  stirring  up  a  whole  past. He  probably  Didn't  feel  like  talking  about  because  it  was  painful.
In  africa  there  were  countries  fighting  for  their  independence. Guinea.
There  was  also  latin  america.
He  said, no  
We  live  on  a  Human-dominated  planet, putting  unprecedented  pressure  on  the  systems  on  earth  
This  is  a  scientific  journey  on  the  challenges  facing  humanity  in  the  global  phase  of  sustainability  
So  i  thought, I'd  bring  her  with  me  today  on  stage  to  have  her  as  a  witness  of  a  remarkable  journey, which  humbly  reminds  us  of  the  period  of  grace  We've  had  over  the  past  10000  years, 
Here  used  as  a  proxy  temperature  variability  
It  was  a  Jumpy  ride  80000  years  back  in  a  crisis. We  leave  africa. We  colonize  australia  in  another  crisis. 60000  years  back. We  leave  asia  for  europe  in  another  crisis, 40000  years  back. And  then  we  enter  the  remarkably  stable  holocene  phase  the  only  period  in  the  whole  history  of  the  planet  that  we  know  of  that  can  support  human  development.
The  majority  of  the  planet  aspiring  for  development  having  the  right  for  development  are  in  large, aspiring  for  an  unsustainable  lifestyle, a  momentous  pressure, 
Now, you  would  have  wished  the  climate  pressure  to  hit  a  strong  planet, a  resilient  planet.
Now  if  we  have  evidence  which  we  now  have  that  wetlands  forests, [unclear]  monsoon  system, the  rainforests  behave  in  this  Nonlinear  way, 
And  could  we  even  thanks  to  major  advancements  in  earth  systems, science, identify  the  thresholds, the  points  where  we  may  expect  Nonlinear  change  
Now, this  is  the  big  bang  equivalent  then  of  human  development  within  the  safe  operating  space  of  the  planetary  boundaries.
In  the  '60s  already  through  the  green  revolution  and  the  Haber-bosch  process  of  fixing  nitrogen  from  the  atmosphere  --  you  know, Human's  today, take  out  more  nitrogen  from  the  atmosphere  than  the  whole  biosphere  does  naturally  as  a  whole  
There's  good  news  here, for  example, from  latin  america, where  Plow-based  farming  systems  of  the  '50s  and  '60s  led  farming, basically  to  a  Dead-end  with  lower  and  lower  yields  degrading  the  organic  matter  and  fundamental  problems  at  the  livelihood  levels  in  paraguay  uruguay  and  a  number  of  countries, brazil, leading  to  innovation  and  entrepreneurship, among  farmers  in  partnership, with  scientists  into  an  agricultural  revolution  of  zero  Tillage  systems  combined  with  Mulch  farming  with  locally  adapted  technologies, which  today, for  example, in  some  countries  have  led  to  a  tremendous  increase  in  area  under  Mulch  zero  till  farming  which  not  only  produces  more  food, but  also  Sequesters  carbon  
It  has  to  basically  do  this  on  current  land.
Elinor  ostrom, the  latest  nobel  laureate  of  economics  clearly  shows  Empirically  across  the  world  that  we  can  govern  the  commons. If  we  invest  in  trust, local  Action-based  partnerships  and  Cross-scale  institutional  innovations  where  local  actors  together  can  deal  with  the  global  commons  at  a  large  scale.
Where  you  give  the  guaranteed  price  for  investment  in  renewable  energy, but  you  can  subsidize  electricity  to  poor  people.
So  there  is  scientific  evidence.
I  was  asked  to  come  here  and  speak  about  creation.
You  know, creation  is  what  put  that  dog  in  that  picture  and  creativity  is  what  makes  us  see  a  chicken  on  his  hindquarters.
And  another  point  --  why  I'm  here  --  is  that  the  day  i  went  to  pick  up  the  plexiglas  trophy, i  rented  a  Tuxedo  for  the  first  time  in  my  life, picked  the  thing  --  Didn't  have  any  friends  
Somebody  was  hitting  somebody  else  with  brass  Knuckles  
And  That's  how  --  with  this  money, i  paid  for  a  ticket  to  come  to  the  united  states  in  1983  and  That's, very  --  the  basic  reason  I'm  talking  to  you  here  today  because  i  got  shot  
Unfortunately, it  has  become  obsolete  because  it  was  designed  for  atari  platform.
But  i  was  still, you  know  --  this  is  a  kitty  cloud  
The  snail  
And  your  eye  Doesn't  know  which  level  to  read  
And  they  would  look  at  it  --  ah, It's, a  pencil, drawing, 
It  had  a  Physicality, and  you  start  going  deeper  and  deeper  into  sort  of  narrative  that  goes  this  way  towards  the  image.
And  i  wanted  to  deal  with  other  subjects  
I  got  some  photographs  from  them  
And  jackson  pollock  also  
I  used  the  dust  at  the  whitney  museum  to  render  some  pieces  of  their  collection  
And  i  picked  Minimalist  pieces  because  They're  about  specificity  
They  do  a  dna  scan  of  this, they  will  come  up  with  a  great  mailing  list.
Also  the  reference  to  gerhard  Richter's  use  of  color  charts  --  and  the  idea  also  entering  another  realm  of  representation, That's  very  common  to  us  today, which  is  the  bit  map.
I  opt  for  very  simple  line  drawings  --  kind  of  stupid, looking  
On  the  other  hand, you  know, i  paid  like  three  dollars, i  think  --  and  i  went  to  a  warehouse  in  queens  to  see  a  version  of  Othello  by  an  amateur  group.
That's  why  we  pay  to  go  to  magic  shows  and  things  like  that  
And  the  information  is  there  twice  --  one  on  each  strand  --  which  is  important, because  when  new  cells  are  formed, these  strands  come  apart. New  strands  are  synthesized  with  the  old  ones  as  Templates  in  an  almost  perfect  process.
So  an  interesting  question  is, what  happened  when  we  met  
So  this  involves  a  lot  of  technical  issues  in  how  you  extract  the  dna, how  you  convert  it  to  a  form, you  can  sequence  
The  same  is  true.
And  further  back  800000  years  ago, is  there  a  common  origin  with  present  day?
But  we  do  find  it  in  papua  new  guinea  and  in  other  islands  in  Melanesia  and  the  pacific  
We  Don't  know  quite  where  the  borders  between  these  people  were.
And  since  we  mixed  elsewhere  I'm, pretty  sure  that  one  day, when  we  will  perhaps  have  a  genome  of  also  these  earlier  forms  in  africa, we  will  find  that  they  have  also  mixed  with  early  modern  humans  in  africa.
And  if  i  were  to  write  a  volume, it  would  be  called  artists  who  have  led  my  exhibitions  because  my  work  in  understanding  art.
My  overall  project  is  about  art  --  specifically  about  black  artists  --  very  generally  about  the  way  in  which  art  can  change  the  way.
What  that  might  mean  for  cultural  movements  all  over  this  moment, the  me  we  seems  incredibly  Prescient, totally  important  
To  this  end, the  specific  project  that  has  made  this  possible  for  me, is  a  series  of  exhibitions  all  titled  with  an  f  --  freestyle, frequency  and  flow  --  which  have  set  out  to  discover  and  define  the  young  black  artists, working  in  this  moment, who  i  feel  strongly  will  continue  to  work  over  the  next  many  years.
It  is  really  in  this  sense  of  discovery  that  i  have  a  new  set  of  questions  that  I'm  asking  
But  really  it  has  been  what  I've  discovered  about  myself.
And  you  put  on  the  T-10, parachute  
They  give  20  minutes  --  That's, a  time  warning  
And  That's  to  boost  Everybody's  confidence  to  show  that  You're, not  scared  
Then  they  give  you  get  ready  
So  nice  air  comes  flowing  in  
So  then  you  look  around  You're  under  a  canopy, and  you  say, this  is  good  
In  30-some  years  of  jumping, i  never  did  one  
And  i  realized  that  if  they  had  to  go  into  combat, they  would  do  what  we  had  taught  them, and  they  would  follow  leaders.
So  now  i  do  that  tuesday  morning  jump, but  It's, not  any  jump  --  that  was  september  11th, 2001  
Sort  of  leadership  by  humiliation, 
I've  got  to  use  video: Teleconferences  I've  got  to  use  chat. I've  got  to  use  email, I've  got  to  use  phone  calls  --  I've  got  to  use  everything. I   can  not  just  for  communication.
And  That's  a  new  kind  of  leadership  for  me, 
So  we  had  to  get  complex  intelligence  together.
In  reality, much  of  the  force  i  led  looked  exactly  like  you  
And  so  instead  of  giving  orders  You're  now  building  consensus  and  You're  building  a  sense  of  shared  purpose, 
It  also  produced  something  which  i  call  an  inversion  of  expertise, because  we  had  so  many  changes  at  the  lower  levels  in  technology  and  tactics  and  whatnot, that  suddenly  the  things  that  we  grew  up  doing  Wasn't. What  the  force  was  doing  anymore.
And  It's  a  brand  new  leadership  challenge  
And  every  morning  in  the  ranger  regiment, every  ranger  --  and  there  are  more  than  2000  of  them  --  says, a  Six-stanza  ranger, creed, 
And  so  the  organizational  relationship  that  bonds  them  is  just  amazing  
That  was  my  journey  
I  came  to  believe  that  a  leader  Isn't  good  because  They're  right, They're, good  because  They're  willing  to  learn  and  to  trust  
Alex  Steffen, and  i  founded  worldchanging  in  late  2003. And  since  then  we  and  our  growing  global  team  of  contributors  have  documented  the  Ever-expanding  variety  of  solutions  that  are  out  there  right  now.
As  norwegian  social  scientist, Evelin  Lindner  has  observed  pessimism  is  a  luxury  of  good  times.
In  difficult  times, pessimism  is  a  self-fulfilling  Self-inflicted, death  sentence, 
Community  tools  like  text  messaging  that  can  tell  you  when  pollen  counts  are  up  or  smog  levels  are  rising  or  a  natural  disaster  is  unfolding. Can  give  you  the  information?
The  political  aspects  of  mobile  phones, Can't  be  ignored  either  from  text  message  swarms  in  korea, helping  to  bring  down  a  government  to  the  Blairwatch  project  in  the  uk, keeping  tabs  on  politicians, who  try  to  avoid  the  press  
Now, imagine  a  similar  model  for  networking  environmentalists, 
Imagine  a  web  portal  collecting  recordings  and  evidence  of  What's  happening  to  the  planet, putting  news  and  data  at  the  fingertips  of  people  of  all  kinds  from  activists  and  researchers  to  businesspeople  and  political  figures  
Now, just  to  be  clear  in  this  talk  I'm  using  the  name  earth  witness  as  part  of  the  scenario, simply  as  a  shorthand  for  what  this  imaginary  project  could  aspire  to  not  to  Piggyback  on  the  wonderful  work  of  the  witness  organization.
Earth  witness  would  show  us  two  worlds, the  world  We're, leaving  behind  and  the  world, We're  building  for  generations  to  come  
After  this, we  noticed  a  couple  of  interesting  things  which  You'll  see  
Make  yourself  understood  to  the  computer  
And  he  Couldn't  travel.
And  all  over  india, at  the  end  of  about  two  years, children  were  beginning  to  google.
They  said, yes, we  did  
So  i  said, for  two  months, you  were  looking  at  stuff.
It  took  me  three  years  to  publish  that  
I  said, no  use  the  method  of  the  grandmother  
What  is  that? Can  you  do  that  again? Can  you  show  me  some  More'?
The  scores  went  up  to  50, which  is  what  the  posh  schools  of  new  delhi  with  a  trained  biotechnology.
The  first  group  --  the  best  one  --  solved  everything  in  20  minutes, 
The  average  score  when  I'd  done  it  with  the  computers  and  the  groups  was  76  percent  
Back  at  Gateshead, a  10-year-old  girl  gets  into  the  heart  of  hinduism  in  15  minutes.
You  know  stuff  which  i  Don't  know  anything  about  
This  is  a  sole  in  newcastle  
I  started  writing  english  questions  on  the  blackboard.
So, you  know, What's  happened  
Thanks  
I  was  too  young  Unmarried. I   had  no  children  Didn't  really  know  africa.
So  then  i  went  the  whole  american  way  with  competitions  team  and  individual  completely  failed.
So  blue  blue, everything  became  blue  
I  think, andrew  pretty  well  covered  that  so  i  will  move  to  the  third  point, which  is  that  markets  alone  also  are  not  going  to  solve  the  problems  of  poverty.
Both  of  them  live  at  the  confluence  of  public  health  and  enterprise  and  both  of  them  because  They're  manufacturers  create  jobs  directly  and  create  incomes, indirectly, because  They're  in  the  malaria  sector  and  africa  loses  about  13  billion  dollars  a  year.
And  It's  really  time  we  start  thinking  more  creatively  about  how  they  can  be  fused.
He  was  actually  living  in  the  kibera  slums  when  his  father  called  him  and  told  him  about  Artemisia  and  the  Value-add  potential  
Samuel's  kids  are  in  private  school  and  He's, starting  to  help  other  farmers  in  the  area  also  go  into  Artemisia  production  --  dignity, being  more  important  than  wealth.
The  next  one, many  of  you  know, 
And  so  from  an  enterprise  perspective  for  africa  and  from  a  public  health  perspective, these  are  real  successes.
We  can  start  building  local  distribution, and  actually  it  can  cost  the  public  sector, much  less  
One  that  people  will  pay  different  prices. But  the  overwhelming  number  of  people  will  come  forth  at  one  dollar  per  net  and  make  a  decision  to  buy  it.
But  what  it  takes  is  a  commitment  from  all  of  us  to  essentially  refuse  trite  assumptions, get  out  of  our  ideological  boxes.
And  we  came  up  with  some  parameters  because  you  know, building  a  rube  goldberg  machine  has  limitations.
Okay, so  now  the  start  to  finish  timing  has  to  be  perfect  
Of  those  85  takes  only  three  actually  successfully  completed  their  run  
And  the  wonderful  elation  that  we  had  when  we  finally  completed  it  
It  think  we  can  do  better  than  this.
Let  me  start  again, 
Where  it  goes  in  the  future  is  questioned  so  That's, the  human  part, 
And  in  that  15  percent, the  main  focus  is  on  human  mind, thinking  skills  somehow  trying  to  unleash  kids  from  the  Straightjacket  of  school, which  is  putting  information  and  dogma  into  them, get  them. So  they  really  think  ask  tough  questions, argue  about  serious  subjects, Don't, believe  everything  That's  in  the  book.
Here's  a  giant  flying  replica  of  a  Pterosaur  that  has  no  tail  
This  was  the  full  size  of  the  original  creature.
It  sends  high-resolution  video  pictures  back  to  the  operator  
Buckminster  fuller  said  it, clearly, there  are  no  passengers  on  spaceship  earth  only  crew.
It's  amazing, just  on  the  Puny  power  of  the  sun  --  by  having  a  super  lightweight  plane, You're  able  to  get  it  up  there.
We  Couldn't  bring  one  here  to  fly  it  and  show  you  
But  There's  a  lot  of  technology, going  
Sorry, 
It  never  makes  a  mistake.
In  concluding  i  want  to  get  back  to  the  big  picture, and  i  have  just  two  final  slides  to  try  and  put  it  in  perspective.
And  so  i  just  put  robotic  and  natural  cockroaches  out  there, but  you  can  fill  in  whatever  you  want. This  is  not  a  forecast.
Last  night, we  gave  it  a  few  too  many  turns. And  it  tried  to  Bash  the  roof  out  also  It's  about  a  gram.
Thank  you  
And  despite  their  ferocious  appearance  tasmanian  devils  are  actually  quite  adorable, little  animals, 
But  inevitably  these  tumors  progress  towards  being  enormous  Ulcerating  tumors  like  this  one  here, 
They  were  too  young  to  survive  without  their  mother  
Scientists  around  the  world  were  intrigued  by  this  cancer, this  infectious  cancer  that  was  spreading  through  the  tasmanian  devil  population  
I  myself  had  a  tumor  removed  from  my  large  intestine  when  i  was  only  14  
Paradoxically  once  established  natural  selection  actually  favors  the  continued  growth  of  cancer  
So  cancer  could  be  thought  of  as  a  strange  short-lived, self-destructive  life  form  --  an  evolutionary  dead  end, 
In  fact, more  genetic  profiling  told  us  that  this  tumor  in  jonas  actually, probably  first  arose  from  the  cells  of  a  female  tasmanian  devil  --  and  jonas  was  clearly  a  male  
So  how  come  a  tumor  that  arose  from  the  cells  of  another  individual  is  growing  on  Jonas'  face  
Well, the  next  breakthrough  came  from  studying  hundreds  of  tasmanian  devil  cancers  from  all  around  tasmania.
They  tend  to  bite  each  other  often  quite  Ferociously, and  usually  on  the  face  
But  if  this  can  happen  in  tasmanian  devils, why  Hasn't  it  happened  in  other  animals, or  even  humans  
Well, the  answer  is, it  has  
She  took  him  to  the  vet, and  the  vet  discovered  something  quite  disgusting  
So  We've  seen  that  this  can  happen  in  animals  
Ad  he  decided  to  put  this  to  the  test  by  actually  deliberately  inoculating  people  with  cancer  from  somebody  else.
Most  of  the  people  that  dr  southam  injected  did  not  go  on  to  develop  cancer  from  the  injected  cells.
And  i  think  that  this  is  something  that  Oncologists  and  epidemiologists  should  be  aware  of  in  the  future.
Why  has  the  record  been  so  poor  
Because  after  years  of  stagnation  and  decline, the  mentality  of  politics  is  that  It's  a  zero-sum  game, 
The  security  council  typically  has  the  responsibility  for  providing  the  peacekeepers  who  build  the  security  
It  does  increase  security  
One  is  jobs  
Now  that  is  difficult  
So  we  need  to  encourage  the  growth  of  local  firms  
And  It's  schizophrenic  because  in  their  hearts, donors  know, That's  not  a  realistic  agenda.
It's  to  split  the  functions  of  a  monopoly  line, ministry  up  into  three  
So  they  Wouldn't  be  provided  thanks  to  the  united  states  government  and  some  ngo  
And  basically  what  I'd  like  to  tell  you  is  that  power  is  changing, and  there  are  two  types  of  changes.
What  We're  going  to  see  in  the  21st  century  is  asia, gradually  returning  to  being  more  than  half  of  the  World's  population  and  more  than  half  of  the  World's  product  
It's, not  just  prevailing  at  war, though, war  still  persists  
If  we  try  to  focus  on  the  reality, then  what  we  need  to  focus  on  is  What's  really  happening  in  terms  of  china  and  the  united  states  
And  that  the  chinese  Won't  catch  up  or  pass  the  americans  until  somewhere  in  the  latter  part.
Why  does  it  matter  who  cares  
The  answer  is, it  matters  quite  a  lot  
So  empowering  china  to  deal  with  its  own  problems  of  carbon  is  good  for  everybody  and  It's, not  a  zero  sum.
How  do  we  define  our  national  interests?
The  world  has  a  new  mania: 
A  mania  for  learning  english  
T, i  Don't  want  to  let  myself  down  
T, perfect  s: perfect  .
S  i  want  to  change  my  life  
So  is  english  mania: good  or  bad  
And  now  english  is  becoming  the  language  of  problem-solving  
It's  a  true  feeling  
Why  is  this  old  table  in  your  office?
And  as  i  grew  up, i  heard  so  much  knowledge  and  so  many  insights  and  so  much  wisdom  come  out  around  this  table. I   began  to  call  it  the  wisdom  table.
And  i  was  so  shocked  so  stunned  i  got  up  and  said, well, thank  you. But  what  do  i  do?
And  that  question  cleared  the  space  
This  film  is  called  world  peace  and  other  4th  grade  achievements.
And  It's  a  beautiful  thing, 
And  i  saw  miss  Ethel  j  banks  who  wore  pearls  and  High-heels  to  elementary  school  every  day  
And  I'm, not  even  talking  about  you  behind  me  because  I've  got  eyes  in  the  back  of  my  head.
And  really  i  feel  as  though, when  i  see  the  film  --  i  have  a  gesture, she  does  like  this  --  i  feel  like  i  am  a  Continuation  of  her  gesture.
And  so  this  world  peace  game  I'd  like  to  tell  you  about  
I  Didn't  want  to  lecture  or  have  just  book  reading  
I  offer  them  the  job, they  can  turn  it  down, and  then  they  choose  their  own  cabinet.
That's, not  all  
I  throw  them  into  this  complex  matrix, and  they  trust  me  because  we  have  a  deep  rich  relationship  together  
There's  oil  spills  environmental  disasters, water  rights  disputes, Breakaway, republics, famine, endangered  species  and  global  warming, 
I  have  no  chance  to  make  any  policy  whatsoever.
And  because  i  Don't  know, They've  got  to  dig  up  the  answer  
My  question  to  you  is  Who's  in  charge  of  that  classroom.
And  we  were  very, upset  
I  could  not  have  designed  that  in  teaching  it  
It'll  be  more  Realer.
We  have  a  lot  of  data, but  i  think  sometimes  we  go  beyond  data  with  the  real  truth  of  What's  going  on  
And  there  are  three  seconds  left  on  the  clock.
I  joined  Telco  made  tata  trucks  pretty  close  to  pune.
So  i  took  one  year  off, and  i  went  to  this  village  science  program  
This  square  might  look  very  square  and  Prim  
But  give  a  child  a  triangle. He  Can't  do  a  thing  to  it.
They  always  make  a  triangular  roof, 
Now, this  is  people  science  
The  insects  are  eaten  by  the  frogs. The  frogs  are  eaten  by  the  snakes.
And  you  put  a  little  fan  here  
And  this  is  a  Hundred-year-old  toy  
I  just  put  this  inside  this  
The  most  expensive  thing  is  the  battery  inside  this  
This  is  an  old  bicycle  tube, which  gives  you  a  broad  rubber  band  two  safety  pins, 
It's  the  interaction  of  both  these  magnets, which  makes  this  motor  spin  
There  are  six  layers  --  three  layers  of  plastic  aluminum  --  which  are  are  sealed  together.
I'm  going  to  keep  this  outside  to  blow  out  I'm  going  to  suck  in  air  
Well  before  i  go  any  further, this  is  something  worth  sharing  
If  i  crank  the  handle, all  the  wool  goes  inside  
There  are  12  million  blind  children  in  our  country  --  who  live  in  a  world  of  darkness.
When  first  you  see  Nehru  and  gandhi, this  is  the  Nehru  cap  --  just  half  a  newspaper  
And  the  second  night, he  would  take  the  same  cap  and  give  it  another.
And  There's  a  third  one  over  here, 
Firstly, radical  increases  in  resource  efficiency.
And  for  all  three  of  these, i  believe  biomimicry  has  a  lot  of  the  solutions  that  We're  going  to  need  
And  I'm  just  going  to  talk  through  this  animation.
And  just  as  natural  systems  tend  to  increase  in  diversity  and  resilience  over  time  There's  a  real  sense  with  this  project  that  the  number  of  possibilities  just  continue  increasing  
And  the  kind  of  elements  I'm  talking  about  are, firstly, we  have  a  restaurant  inside  a  productive  greenhouse  a  bit  like  this  one  in  amsterdam  called  de  Kas  
So, for  instance, when  julius  Caesar  arrived  in  north  africa, huge  areas  of  north  africa  were  covered  in  cedar  and  Cypress  forests.
The  converse  is  also  true  
The  more  vegetation, we  lose  the  more  That's  likely  to  exacerbate  climate  change  and  lead  to  further, desertification, 
The  way  it  does  this  is  it  comes  out  at  night, Crawls  to  the  top  of  a  sand, dune. And  because  It's  got  a  Matte  black  shell  is  able  to  radiate  heat  out  to  the  night  sky  and  become  slightly  cooler  than  its  surroundings.
And  the  ingenuity, if  you  could  call  it  that  goes  even  further  
Between  them  There's, a  Waxy  finish  which  Repels  water  
We're  working  with  the  guy  who  invented  the  seawater  greenhouse  
This  is  a  greenhouse  designed  for  Arid, coastal  regions. And  the  way  it  works  is  that  you  have  this  whole  wall  of  Evaporator  Grills, and  you  Trickle  seawater  over  that. So  that  wind  blows  through, it  picks  up  a  lot  of  moisture  and  is  cooled  in  the  process.
And  what  they  found  with  the  first  seawater  greenhouse  that  was  built, was  it  was  producing  slightly  more  freshwater  than  it  needed  for  the  plants  inside  
And  when  you  think  about  nature, often  you  think  about  it  as  being  all  about  competition, 
You  think, what  can  i  add  to  the  system  to  create  more  value?
And  it  turns  out  that  different  things  crystallize  out  at  different  stages.
Now, we  would  be  able  to  make  use  of  all  that  waste  brine  
We  could  evaporate  it  to  enhance  the  restorative  benefits  and  capture  the  salts  transforming  an  urgent  waste  problem  into  a  big  opportunity.
Far  too  much  of  the  talk  about  the  environment  uses  very  negative  language.
And  this  is  an  important  point.
There  are  very  few  doctors.
Very  simple  
And  knowing  that  starts  to  explain  a  lot  of  Long-standing  mysteries  in  science, 
It  also  brings  up  new  issues, though, like  computational  Irreducibility  
You  know, in  working  on  this  science  for  many  years, i  kept  wondering, what  will  be  its  first  killer  app  
Let's  start  off  with  something  really  easy  
And  it  should  be  able  to  tell  us  that  
Let's  say, the  revenue  of  microsoft  
Well, even  starting  from  mathematica, this  is  still  a  huge  amount  of  work.
Well, a  crucial  idea  of  wolfram  alpha  is  that  you  can  just  ask  it  questions  using  ordinary  human  language, which  means  that  We've  got  to  be  able  to  take  all  those  strange  utterances  that  people  type  into  the  input  field  and  understand  them  
And  i  must  say  that  i  thought  that  step  might  just  be  plain.
Right  now, if  we  look  at  web  queries, more  than  80  percent  of  them, get  handled  successfully.
And  when  one  does  that  one  really  changes  the  economics  of  delivering  computational  things, whether  It's  on  the  web  or  elsewhere  
I'll  show  you  one  example  here  
Something  like  rule  30, for  example, turns  out  to  be  a  really  good  randomness  generator.
So  could  that  be  What's  going  on  with  our  whole  universe?
But  in  at  least  a  large  class  of  cases, one  can  think  of  the  universe  as  being  like  some  kind  of  network, which  when  it  gets  big  enough  behaves  like  continuous  space  in  much  the  same  way  as  having  lots  of  molecules  can  behave  like  a  continuous  fluid.
Actually  i  Haven't  shown  these  before, but  here  are  a  few  of  the  candidate  universes  that  I've  looked  at  
Benoit  mandelbrot  is  in  the  audience.
We've  questioned  the  future  of  capitalism  
And  the  idea  is  a  simple  simple  idea, which  is  the  fact  that  the  consumer  has  moved  from  a  state  of  anxiety  to  action  
The  consumer  is  empowered  
Do  you  know  what  this  was  right  here.
And  what  you  end  up  seeing  is  the  whole  phenomenon  of  the  fact  that  we  are  actually  stepping  forth  and  basically  leveraging  future. Education  future.
However, consumers  have  moved  
Dentists  report  molars, you  know, people  grinding  their  teeth  coming  in  and  reporting  the  fact  that  They've  had  stress  
But  seriously, what  we  see  happening. And  the  reason  i  want  to  stress  that  the  consumer  is  not  in  retreat, is  that  this  is  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  the  consumer  who  drove  us  into  this  recession  to  lead  us  right  back  out.
We  see  high-end  Haggling  in  fashion  today.
So  from  a  value  and  values  standpoint, what  companies  can  do  is  connect  in  lots  of  different  ways.
Gore-tex  is  all  about  personal  accountability  of  their  management  and  their  employees  to  the  point  where  they  really  kind  of  Shun  the  idea  of  bosses  
The  third  of  the  four  laws  of  post-crisis  consumerism  is  about  durable  living  
I  was  fascinated  to  learn  that  30  percent  of  all  homes  in  america  are  actually  built  by  owners  
Let's  look  at  a  couple  of  quick  examples.
You  need  to  harness  it. You  need  to  give  it  meaning.
This  Kogi  Doesn't  exist, It's  a  moving  truck, right  
Or  you  look  at  johnson  &amp, Johnson's, Momversations  
You  see  this  rising  force  in  sort  of  total  transparency  and  openness  that  companies  are  starting  to  adopt  all  because  the  consumer  is  demanding  it  
But  at  the  same  time, this  is  also  a  tremendous  opportunity.
So  i  decided  to  investigate  
So  I'm  going  to  challenge  all  of  you  
We  talk  about  world  peace  
And  i  want  to  thank  all  of  you  in  the  audience  for  being  great  husbands, great  mothers  friends, daughters, sons  ,
That's  what  i  do  in  life  --  telling  stories, writing  novels  --  and  today  i  would  like  to  tell  you  a  few  stories  about  the  art  of  storytelling  and  also  some  supernatural  creatures  called  the  Djinni  
I  was  born  in  Strasbourg  france  to  turkish  parents  
In  response, she  said, yes, praying  is  effective.
We  all  do  
Our  friends, neighbors, colleagues  family  --  if  all  the  people  in  our  inner  circle  resemble  us, it  means  we  are  surrounded  with  our  mirror  image.
Instead  it  generated  an  atmosphere  in  which  each  child  was  seen  --  not  as  an  individual  on  his  own, but  as  the  representative  of  something  larger  
I  came  to  learn  that  these  were  the  three  main  stereotypes  about  my  country  politics, cigarettes  and  the  veil  
I  lived  in  a  very  vibrant  diverse  neighborhood, where  i  wrote  several  of  my  novels  
What  i  experienced  as  a  child  in  that  school, in  madrid, is  happening  in  the  literary  world  today, 
Meanwhile, the  other  leg  draws  a  wide  circle, constantly  moving  
We  see  them  as  the  domain  of  supernatural  creatures, like  the  Djinn  who  are  made  of  Smokeless  fire  and  are  the  symbol  of  Elusiveness  
Perhaps  That's, not  the  right  way  to  start  at  all  
You  see  there  It's  about  620  billion  a  year  
R&ampd  in  total  in  the  economy, publicly  funded, is  about  06  percent  of  gdp.
The  first  thing  i  want  to  say, and  this  is  straight  from  wonders  of  the  solar  system  is  that  our  exploration  of  the  solar  system.
So, tiny, moon, 
That's  fascinating  and  beautiful  in  itself.
And  What's  important  about  that  is  that  on  our  planet  on  earth, wherever  we  find  liquid  water, we  find  life  
Tremendous  and  beautiful  discovery, 
And  they  saw  strange  pictures  like  this  
It's  called  Helios  --  Helios  from  the  sun, 
That's  a  type  Ia  supernova  explosion: 
It  sits  there  about  say, 13  times  the  mass  of  the  sun  
I  think  That's  a  remarkable  demonstration  of  the  power  and  beauty  and  universality  of  the  laws  of  physics, because  we  understand  that  process, because  we  understand  the  structure  of  atoms  here  on  earth.
And  if  i  blow  it  up  there, you  see  it  
But  it  visited  jupiter, saturn, Uranus  and  neptune, 
You  could  have  made  it  in  the  1890s.
Let  me  leave  the  last  words  to  someone  Who's  rapidly  becoming  a  hero  of  mine  Humphrey  Davy, who  did  his  science  at  the  turn  of  the  19th  century.
Thank  you  
Streets  have  names. Blocks  are  just  the  unnamed  spaces  in  between  streets.
They  say, oh, well, That's  block  17.
Just  look  at  google  maps  here, There's  block, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19  
You  say, ok, but  walking  around  the  neighborhood, i  noticed  that  the  house  numbers  Don't  go  in  order  
It's  a  phenomenon  on  the  internet  today  called  behavioral  tracking. And  it  is  very  big  business.
Our  daughter, then  joined  us  at  the  breakfast  table. And  i  asked  her, is  there  an  emphasis  on  music  literacy  in  your  school?
I  go  to  work, i  check  email. I   log  onto  a  few  more  social  sites. I   blog. I   check  more  news  reports. I   share  some  of  those  news  reports. I   go  look  at  some  videos.
And  I’d  say, well, I’m  walking  for  the  environment.
I  called  my  parents  up  
And  so  i  did  
It’s  only  500  miles  
I  had  written  the  university  of  montana  two  years  earlier  and  said, I'd  like  to  go  to  school. There.
But  i  use  that  story, because  they  really  wanted  to  help  me  
I  had  13  students  when  i  first  walked  into  the  class  
I  could  see  they  were  looking  for  the  schedule  to  see  when  they  could  get  out  
They  had  to  take  that  class  with  me, 
And  on  earth  day, 1990  --  the  20th  anniversary  of  earth  day  --  That’s, when  i  began  to  speak  
I  got  on  a  sailboat, and  i  sailed  down  to  the  caribbean  and  walked  through  all  of  the  islands  and  to  venezuela  
And  i  got  to  --  i  start  saying  free  at  last  --  thank  god  almighty  I’m  free  at  last  
I  had  no  idea  i  was  going  to  become  a  Un, ambassador  
I  was  going  to  have  to  change  
I  know  i  needed  to  change  because  it  would  be  the  only  way  that  i  could  be  here  today.
When  does  learning  begin  
Well  today  i  want  to  present  to  you  an  idea  that  may  be  surprising  and  may  even  seem  implausible, but  which  is  supported  by  the  latest  evidence  from  psychology  and  biology, 
Now, I'm  a  science.
I  write  books  and  magazine  articles  
The  flavors  of  the  food, a  pregnant  woman  eats  find  their  way  into  the  Amniotic  fluid, which  is  continuously  swallowed  by  the  fetus.
What  this  means  is  that  fetuses  are  effectively  being  taught  by  their  mothers  about  what  is  safe  and  good  to  eat  
The  pregnant, Woman's  diet  and  stress  level  in  particular, provide  important  clues  to  prevailing  conditions, like  a  finger  lifted  to  the  wind  
The  hunger  winter, as  it  came  to  be  known  killed  some  10000  people  and  weakened  thousands  more  
Learning  is  one  of  Life's  most  essential  activities, and  it  begins  much  earlier  than  we  ever  imagined.
You'd  still  have  five  billion  left  in  change. And  people  would  ask  for  the  trains  to  be  slowed  down.
Now  years, after  you  remember  the  strategic  question  of  whether  You're  flying  in  a  777  or  an  airbus, you  remember  those  words.
I  mean, it  could  almost  be  rather  like  that  scene  from  the  film  airplane  
I  spoke  about  this  before, and  a  brilliant  person  got  in  touch  with  me  and  said, okay, what  can  you  do  
One  of  them, also  being, although  logically  It's  quite  a  good  idea  to  have  a  lift  with  no  up  and  down  button  in  it. If  it  only  serves  two  floors, It's, actually  bloody, terrifying.
They  said, can  we  do  an  advertising  campaign?
I  said, It's  really, really  easy.
Now, interesting  that  no  single  person  does  that, or  at  least  can  admit  to  being  so  Anal  as  to  do  it.
Moving  over, we  come, of  course  to  consultancy  
I  mean, tiger  surely  was  actually  obeying  the  accenture  model.
That's  why  i  call  for  the  chief  detail  officer  
But  as  i  was  moving  away  from  the  traditional  classical  repertoire  and  trying  to  find  new  ways  of  musical  expression, i  realized  that  with  Today's  technological  resources, There's, no  reason  to  limit  what  can  be  produced  at  one  time  from  a  single  string  instrument  
But  what  actually  interests  me  a  lot  more  is  the  fact  that  in  the  tip  of  each  controller  is  a  relatively  High-performing, infrared  camera  
And  i  also  was  taught  coupled  with  that  that  it  was  my  job  --  this  classroom  full  of  five  and  six  year-old  children  --  it  was  our  job  apparently  to  help  
This  is  what  jesus  asked  of  us  
That  was  news  to  me, and  it  felt  like  it  was  a  very  important  thing  to  get  to  participate  in  
And  i  felt  overwhelmed  
And  i  Didn't  know  what  would  happen  when  i  ran  out  of  things  to  give, especially  if  the  problem  was  never  going  away.
I  heard  about  things  that  were  going  wrong  in  the  lives  of  the  poor  
I  started  to  feel  guilty  for  my  own  relative  wealth, because  i  Wasn't  doing  more  apparently  to  make  things  better  
It  became  a  transaction  for  me, became  sort  of  a  trade  
So  i  spent  three  months  in  kenya, uganda  and  tanzania, interviewing  entrepreneurs  that  had  received  100  dollars  to  start  or  grow  a  business  
I  was  starting  to  be  friends  and  get  to  know  their  personal  stories.
But  there  were  these  beautiful  details, even  if  i  talked  to  20  goat  herders  in  a  row  and  some  days  That's, what  happened  --  these  beautiful  details  of  life  change  that  were  meaningful  to  them  
I  never  once  was  asked  for  a  donation  which  had  kind  of  been  my  mode  right?
We  sent  it  over  to  uganda  
When  you  lend  them  money  and  they  slowly  pay  you  back  over  time, you  have  this  excuse  to  have  an  ongoing  dialogue, 
So  the  mapping  of  participating  in  the  story, it  actually  flows  with  the  up  and  down  
We  make  it  really, really  simple  for  me  as  well  as  anyone  else  who  wants  to  use  the  site  
But  the  good  news  is, i  Don't  think  i  need  to  stand  here  and  convince  you  to  care  --  I'm, not  even  going  to  try  
And  I'm  grateful  that  whenever  i  do  that  guaranteed, i  am  inspired  --  i  am  inspired  by  the  person.
What  is  the  future  of  the  human  race?
If  not  what  created  the  universe  
First  there  were  the  laws  like  Maxwell's  equations  and  general  relativity, that  determined  the  evolution  of  the  universe, given  its  state  over  all  of  space  at  one  time.
However, this  division  into  laws  of  evolution  and  initial  conditions  depends  on  time  and  space, being  separate  and  distinct  
Indeed, it  has  probably  given  me  more  time  than  most  people  to  pursue  the  quest  for  knowledge.
Professor  hawking.
I'm  a  Geologist  by  training, but  i  love  that  
Here, We're  going  to  see  one  backing  into  a  Crevice  and  watch  his  tentacles  --  he  just  pulls  them  in  makes  them  look  just  like  algae.
That's, an  amazing  thing, 
And  an  octopus  Ain't  that  amazing  now, roger  Spooked  him. So  he  took  off  in  a  cloud  of  ink.
And  now, He's  gone  and  so  am  i  thank  you  very  much.
That's  the  lucy  species  and  was  found  by  my  research  team  in  december  of  2000, in  an  area  called  Dikika  
It's  in  the  northeastern  part  of  ethiopia  
You  Don't  just  jump  into  an  invitation  
First  entertainment  comes  evidence  from  flutes  that  are  35000  years  old  
When  you  get  there, this  is  what  you  see  and  It's  the  vastness  of  the  place, which  makes  you  feel  helpless  and  vulnerable.
You  find  elephants, Rhinos, monkeys, pigs, etc.
Again, another  one  That's, a  monkey  That's, a  pig, etc.
Here  is  a  close-up  of  the  fossil  after  five  years  of  cleaning  preparation  and  description, which  was  very  long. And  i  had  to  expose  the  bones  from  the  sandstone  block. I   just  showed  you  in  the  previous  slide.
So  then  once  You've  done  that  the  next  stage  is  to  know  what  it  is.
You  Don't  see  that  in  chimpanzees, and  you  Don't  see  this  very  projecting  canine  
And  how  old  was  she  when  she  died  
That's  why  we  need  care  from  our  parents  
So  by  being  at  the  cusp  of  our  evolutionary  history, selam, unites  us  all  and  gives  us  a  unique  account  on  what  makes  us  human  
Up  to  now, the  knowledge  that  we  had  about  our  ancestors  came  essentially  from  adult  individuals, because  the  fossils, the  baby  fossils  were  missing  
Imagine  somebody  coming  from  mars, and  his  job  is  to  report  on  the  type  of  people  occupying  our  planet  earth, and  you  hide  all  the  babies, the  children, and  he  goes  back  and  reports  
And  they  were  probably  not  aware  of  this  future  legacy, but  they  did  great  
With  an  average  depth  of  the  oceans  of  4000  meters, in  fact, the  high  seas  covers  and  provides  nearly  90  percent  of  the  habitat  for  life  on  this  earth.
It  is  in  theory, the  global  commons  belonging  to  us  all  
So  here  is  a  picture  of  the  high  seas  as  seen  from  above  --  that  area  in  the  darker  blue  
And  of  course, if  you  want  people  to  play  by  the  rules, you  still  need  an  effective  system  of  monitoring  and  enforcement  for  as  We've  discovered.
It's  also  known  as  the  spawning  ground  for  Eels  from  northern  european  and  northern  american  rivers  that  are  now  so  dwindling  in  numbers  that  They've  actually  stopped  showing  up  in  stockholm  and  five  showed  up  in  the  uk.
It's  actually  a  bay  
Coming  closer  to  here, the  costa  rica  dome  is  a  recently  discovered  area  --  potentially  year-round  habitat  for  blue  whales.
That  is  it  provides  a  wonderful  example  of  where  you  can  go  with  a  real  regional  initiative.
So  what  We've  been  suggesting  is  that  we  either  need  to  Amend  the  world  heritage  convention, so  that  it  can  adopt  and  urge  universal  protection  of  these  world  heritage  sites, or  we  need  to  change  the  name  and  call  it  Half-the-world  heritage  convention, 
What  i  find  so  exciting  is  that  the  census  of  marine  life  has  looked  at  more  than  the  tagging  of  pacific  predators, It's  also  looked  in  the  really  unexplored  mid-water  column  where  creatures  like  this.
And  the  exciting  thing  is  that  we  do  have  sufficient  information  to  move  ahead  to  protect  some  of  these  significant  hope  spots  Hotspots  
But  not  all  the  vessels  have  those  to  date  
We  need  to  get  the  new  paradigm  of  precaution  and  respect  
So  here  we  are  seven  years  500  interviews  later  and  I'm  Gonna.
And  the  first  thing  i  say  to  them  is  ok, well, you  Can't  serve  yourself.
While  that  might  be  a  somewhat  Morbid  thought, i  think  it  has  some  really  profound  implications  that  are  worth  exploring  
But  today, We're  all  creating  this  incredibly  rich  digital  archive, That's  going  to  live  in  the  cloud  indefinitely  years  after  We're  gone  
And  what  this  lets  you  do  is  create  an  online  tribute  to  your  loved  ones, complete  with  photos  and  videos  and  stories  that  they  can  post  after  you  die.
But  what  i  think  comes  next  is  far  more  interesting  
Now, We're  already  starting  to  see  some  experiments  here.
Taking  it  a  step  further, Mit's  media  lab  is  working  on  robots  that  can  interact  more  like  humans.
It's, not  that  It's  not  possible  to  feed  Clothe  and  house  us  all  and  have  us  live  decent  lives.
And  That's, what  will  happen  to  us  
I  accept  where  we  are  
The  future  is  inherently  uncertain  .
Imagine  our  Highly-tuned  Just-in-time  food  industry  and  our  Highly-stressed  agricultural  system, failing  and  supermarket  shelves  Emptying, 
If  we  feel  it  now  and  think  it  through, we  will  realize  we  have  nothing  to  fear, but  fear  itself  
We  can  do  this  
I  know  the  free  market  fundamentalists  will  tell  you  that  more  growth  more  stuff  and  nine  billion  people  going  shopping  is  the  best  we  can  do  
We  have  achieved  remarkable  things  since  working  out  how  to  grow  food.
We've  built  a  powerful  foundation  of  science, knowledge  and  technology  --  more  than  enough  to  build  a  society  where  nine  billion  people  can  lead  decent  meaningful  and  satisfying  lives  
We  can  choose  this  moment  of  crisis  to  ask  and  answer  the  big  questions  of  Society's  evolution  --  like, what  do  we  want  to  be  when  we  grow  up  when  we  move  past  this  Bumbling  adolescence, where  we  think  there  are  no  limits  and  suffer  delusions  of  immortality, 
We  can  choose  life  over  fear, 
And  one  more  thing  archie  was  suffering  from  this  illness  himself.
So  the  situation  seemed  pretty  desperate  
He  gives  half  of  them  vitamin  B12  
So  cochrane, then  goes  to  the  germans  who  are  running  the  prison  camp  
And  he  Can't  understand  how  this  Barbarism  can  be  Tolerated, and  he  vents  his  frustrations  
So  the  symptoms  of  the  complex  are  no  matter  how  complicated  the  problem  you  have  an  absolutely  overwhelming  belief  that  you  are  Infallibly  right  in  your  solution, 
You  could  count  them  in  five  minutes, 
What  is  evolution  
How  do  you  do  it?
It  falls  to  the  floor, 
You  make  lots  of  money  
Ten  percent  of  americans  Don't  disappear  every  year  
I  sometimes  wonder, 
Now  I've  been  sort  of  banging  on  about  this  for  the  last  couple  of  months. And  people  sometimes  say  to  me.
And  There's  an  authority  figure  in  the  corner  behind  the  Teacher's  desk, who  knows  all  the  answers  
When  schools  stop  doing  that  all  the  time  i  will  admit  that, yes, It's  obvious  that  trial  and  error  is  a  good  thing.
Until  then  until  then  I'm  going  to  keep  banging  on  about  trial  and  error  and  why  we  should  abandon  the  god  complex  
They  had  the  god  complex  in  spades.
And  after  the  trial  had  been  running  for  a  little  while  he  gathered  together, all  his  colleagues  around  his  table, and  he  said, well, gentlemen, we  have  some  preliminary  results.
Shut  it  down  at  once  
Tumbleweed  rolls  through  the  meeting  room  
It  Isn't  easy, 
So  shortly  after  the  war, this  young  man, Yutaka  Taniyama  developed  this  amazing  Conjecture  called  the  Taniyama-shimura  Conjecture  
In  fact, it  turns  out  It's  equivalent  to  proving  Fermat's  last  theorem  
You  prove  one, you  prove  the  other  
And  the  problem  with  leverage  is  it  makes  the  us  financial  system.
That  means  every  bad  loan  goes  bad  47  times  over  
And  as  you  think  about  that  You've  got  to  wonder, so  what  do  banks  have  in  store  for  you  now, 
Except  We've  been.
We're  going  to  start  to  pay  them  
This  guy  runs  the  china, investment  corporation, 
This  is  an  actual  bill  
If  you  look  at  the  federal  budget, this  is  what  it  looks  like.
Everything  else  is  mandated.
That's, the  short  term, That's, the  flame  part  
Among  other  things  because  startup  companies  are  02  percent  of  us, gdp, Investmentm  and  They're  about  178  percent  of  output.
Twenty-one  countries  came  together, dozens  of  teams, 
Two  years  ago, you  saw  this  creature  
But  then, if  you  lose  one  of  those  second  set  of  teeth, they  Don't  regrow  unless  if  You're  a  lawyer  
So  there  are  now  nine  women  walking  around  boston  with  Re-grown  bladders, which  is  much  more  pleasant  than  walking  around  with  a  whole  bunch  of  plastic  bags  for  the  rest  of  your  life.
If  you  Don't  have  a  flat  world, That's  not  good, which  is  why  the  Robot's  We're  designing  today  are  a  little  different  
And  this  stuff  is  moving  very  quickly.
And  about  two  or  three  years  after  they  can  hear  as  well  as  you, and  i  can  They'll  be  able  to  hear  maybe  how  bats  sing  or  how  whales  talk  or  how  dogs  talk  and  other  types  of  Tonal  scales.
This  is  a  group  in  germany, That's  beginning  to  engineer  eyes.
Very  primitive  
They'll  do  stuff  you.
And  It's  the  150th  anniversary  of  the  publication  of  the  origin  of  species, 
Maybe  not  
Once  upon  a  time, there  was  a  dread  disease  that  Afflicted  children  
And  so, as  a  consequence, a  few  years  later, another  scientist  --  perhaps  maybe  this  scientist, not  quite  as  brilliant  as  the  one  who  had  Preceded  him.
And  the  beauty  of  the  second  cure  for  this  disease  was  that  it  could  be  used  on  infants  and  one-year-olds  
And  the  government, they  heard  her  story  and  the  other  people, and  they  said, yeah, You're, right?
We  would  lose  all  of  our  market  
So  many  times  when  you  try  to  do  research  on  data, it  records  complicated  stories  --  It's  hard  to  find  in  the  data.
And  then  finally, the  last  set  of  bars  which  are  really  controlling  for  everything  you  could  possibly  imagine  about  the  crash  50, 75, 100  different  characteristics  of  the  crash  
And  the  other  thing  you  might  argue  is  well  car  seats  have  got  a  lot  better  over  time.
So  they  just  have  these  bench  seats, and  they  strap  the  car  seat  and  the  seatbelt  onto  it  
Anyway, it  turns  out  that  those  two  crashes  that  actually  the  three-year-old  did  slightly  worse.
And  this  seatbelt  would  have  passed  with  flying  colors  into  being  approved  as  a  car  seat.
It's  in  5000  days, all  this  stuff  has  come  
There's, two  million  emails  per  second  
It's  just  a  huge  machine, and  it  uses  five  percent  of  the  global  electricity  on  the  planet.
And  in  some  ways, It's  sort  of  back  to  the  kind  of  old  idea  of  centralized  computing  
And  i  am  suggesting  that  every  bit  will  be  owned  by  the  web.
They're  going  to  talk  to  the  machine  
Now  with  Rfids  and  other  things  --  whatever  technology  it  is  it  Doesn't  really  matter. The  point  is  that  everything  will  have  embedded  in  it. Some  sensor  connecting  it  to  the  machine. And  so  we  have  basically  an  internet  of  things.
But  in  fact, what  the  new  economy  really  is  is  the  marriage  of  those  two, where  we  embed  the  information  and  the  digital  nature  of  things  into  the  material  world.
Attention  is  the  currency  
And  I'm  saying, humans  are  now  going  to  be  the  extended  senses  of  the  machine  in  a  certain  sense.
Now, the  second  thing  that  i  want  to  talk  about  was  this  idea  of  Restructuring  that  what  the  web  is  doing  is  Restructuring  
And  what  you  had  to  do  was  --  if  you  wanted  to  participate  in  this, you  had  to  share  packets  of  information  
It  Wasn't  like  a  telephone  system, where  you  had  control  of  a  line  you  had  to  share  packets  
The  second  stage  that  We're  in  now  is  the  idea  of  linking  pages  
You  Couldn't  deny  --  if  someone  wanted  to  link  to  you, you  Couldn't  stop  them.
So  the  last  thing  i  want  to  talk  about  is  this  idea  that  We're  going  to  be  Codependent  
And  what  is  happening  with  this  is  some  kind  of  ai, but  It's, not  the  ai  in  conscious  ai  as  being  an  expert.
But  It'll  anticipate  what  We're  doing  in  a  good  sense, 
And  all  these  devices  will  be  Portals  into  that  
It  was  on  Jonestown  
The  top  picture  is  a  group  of  moonies  that  have  been  blessed  by  their  Messiah  
And  so  what  is  this, how  does  this  work  
These  easy  ideas  to  complex  questions  are  very  appealing  when  you  are  emotionally  vulnerable, 
We're  beginning  to  look  inside  the  brain  
And  so  if  you  looked  at  my  brain  or  any  brain  That's  infected  with  a  viral  memetic  infection  like  this, and  compared  it  to  anyone  in  this  room, or  anyone  who  uses  critical  thinking  on  a  regular  basis, i  am  convinced  it  would  look  very, very  different  
Because  i  have  to  say, for  my  whole  career, if  There's  anything  That's  been  consistent, It's  been  that  you  Can't, do  it  
It's  Calvino's  idea  of  the  quickest  way  between  two  points  is  the  circuitous  line, not  the  straight  line.
We  make  physical  things  buildings  that  become  a  part  in  an  Accretional  process.
And  I've  had  for  30  years, an  interest  in  a  series  of  complexities, where  a  series  of  forces  are  brought  to  bear  and  to  understand  the  nature  of  the  final  result  of  that, representing  the  building  itself  
This  is  a  project  that  we  just  finished  in  Penang  for  a  very, very  large  city  project  that  came  directly  out  of  this  process, which  is  the  result  of  the  multiplicity  of  forces  that  produce  it.
And  an  image  which  may  be  closest  talks  about  the  use  of  light  as  a  medium  that  light  becomes  literally  a  building  material.
This  will  be  the  first  building  in  the  united  states  that  took  --  well, i  Can't  say  it  took  the  air  conditioning  out, It's, a  hybrid, 
And  i  understood  that  building  really  could  be  the  augmentation  of  the  Earth's  surface, and  it  completely  shifted  the  notion  of  building  ground  in  the  most  basic  sense.
What  I'm  interested  in  are  how  these  ideas  participate  in  the  educational  process  of  young  people, 
One  enters  the  building  as  it  lifts  off  the  ground, and  it  becomes  part  of  the  idea.
And  then  the  skin  --  the  edges  of  this  --  all  promote  the  dynamic, the  movement  of  the  building  as  a  series  of  seismic  shifts  geologic  shifts  right  
And  finally, one  of  the  most  interesting  projects  --  It's, a  courthouse  
Here's  a  piano  Nobile, which  is  a  device  used  in  the  renaissance  
It  changed  the  way  our  history  developed  
It  is  made  for  a  diet, which  is  soft  Mushy, which  is  reduced  in  fibers, which  is  very  easily  Chewable  and  Digestible  
Sounds  like  fast  food, Doesn't, it  
It's  technology, 
So  this  ingenuity  of  our  ancestors  to  invent  this, most  marvelous  technology, 
We  populated  all  the  Ecologies  
It  keeps  also  your  brain  working  
Okay, It's  not  obvious  to  be  honest, 
Now, having  a  large  brain, as  you  know, is  a  big  advantage  because  you  can  actually  influence  your  environment.
You  know, we  have  up  to  five  tastes  three  of  them  sustain  us.
So  we  can  make  mixtures  of  all  this  kind  of  thing  because  we  know  that  in  cooking, we  can  transform  it  to  the  form.
So  satisfaction  was  a  very  important  part.
If  you  get  a  stomach  Ache, if  you  get  a  little  bit  bloated  was  not  the  right  food  was  not  the  right  cooking  manipulation, or  maybe  other  things  went  wrong.
But  what  it  means  to  have  a  brain  there  is  that  not  only  the  big  brain  has  to  talk  with  the  food. The  food  has  to  talk  with  the  brain, because  we  have  to  learn  actually  how  to  talk  to  the  brains.
This  is  the  layer  which  actually  touches  the  food  you  are  swallowing  and  you  digest, which  is  actually  the  lumen  
What  it  means  is  that  we  have  a  layered  control  system.
So  if  you  Override  the  hunger  signal, you  can  have  a  disorder, which  is  called  Anorexia  
This  is  fat, Digestion, 
Actually, what  happens  is  that  a  very  intricate  structure  appears  
You  know, culture  was  born  of  the  imagination  and  the  imagination  --  the  imagination, as  we  know  it  --  came  into  being  when  our  species  descended  from  our  Progenitor, homo  erectus  and  infused  with  consciousness, began  a  journey  that  would  carry  it  to  every  corner  of  the  habitable  world, 
And  the  way  Clayton  put  it  was  this  way, 
I  recently  sailed  on  the  Hokulea  named  after  the  sacred  star  of  hawaii  throughout  the  south  pacific  to  make  a  film  about  the  navigators  
I  spent  30  years  living  amongst  the  people  of  Chinchero.
And  then  you  do  the  ritual  dances  that  empower  the  crosses  
These  of  course, are  the  descendants  of  the  ancient  Tairona  civilization.
There  are  four  societies, the  Kogi, the  Wiwa, the  Kankwano  and  the  Arhuacos  
I  traveled  with  the  Arhuacos, and  the  wonderful  thing  about  this  story  was  that  this  man, danilo  Villafane  --  if  we  just  jump  back  here  for  a  second  
We  traveled  high  into  the  Paramo, and  as  we  Crested  the  hills, we  realized  that  the  men  were  interpreting  every  single  bump  on  the  landscape  in  terms  of  their  own  intense  religiosity, 
And  we  ran  into  a  farc  patrol  at  dawn.
They  dismiss  the  rest  of  us  who  have  ruined  the  world  as  the  younger  brothers, they  Cannot  understand  why  it  is  that  we  do  what  we  do  to  the  earth.
And  when  asked  that  question, they  respond  with  6000  different  voices  
They  are  unique  answers  to  that  fundamental  question: what  does  it  mean  to  be  human  and  alive?
So  You're  living  through  a  time  when  virtually  half  of  Humanity's  intellectual  social  and  spiritual  legacy  is  being  allowed  to  slip  away.
This  does  not  have  to  happen.
So  I'd  like  to  spend  a  few  minutes  with  you  folks  today, imagining  what  our  planet  might  look  like  in  a  thousand  years.
This  is  crazy  
If  You're  in  northern  europe  or  north  america, you  can  use  things  like  Buckwheat  husks  or  Oat  hulls  
Because  the  manufacturing  process  is  our  organism  
They're  not  going  to  Clog  up  Earth's  ecosystems, they  work  great  
My  brief  as  You've  just  heard, is  to  tell  you  about  statistics  --  and  to  be  more  precise  to  tell  you  some  exciting  things  about  statistics  
Don't  tell  her, i  said  that  
She  paused  and  said, he  models  things  
The  next  time  after  the  15th  toss  
That's  what  i  want  this  side  to  think  about  
Either  They're  the  same  or  this  One's  bigger  than  this  one  or  this  One's  bigger  than  that.
Who  thinks  that  c  is  true  --  that  on  average, It'll  take  less  time  to  see  head-tail-head  than  head-tail-tail.
The  Champagne's  on  ice, just  next  to  you  You've  got  the  glasses  Chilled  to  celebrate  
And  if  it  comes  down  a  head, That's, great  
It's  the  same  for  the  first  two  parts  of  the  sequence  
If  It's  a  head  You're  disappointed  but  You're  still  a  third  of  the  way  to  your  pattern  again, 
This  is  my  little  diversion  into  my  real  passion, which  is  genetics.
When  you  toss  a  coin, you  get  a  sequence  of  heads  and  tails  
And  They're, an  enormously  useful  tool  in  modern  molecular  biology, 
But  it  turns  out  that  unlocking  the  secrets  in  the  information  generated  by  modern  experimental  technologies, a  key  part  of  that  has  to  do  with  fairly  sophisticated  --  You'll, be  relieved  to  know  that  i  do  something  useful  in  my  day  job  rather  more  sophisticated  than  the  head-tail-head  story  --  but  quite  sophisticated  computer, Modelings  and  mathematical  Modelings  and  modern  statistical  techniques, 
It's, not  the  answer  and  It's, not  because  It's, only  part  of  the  story  
Here's  a  little  Caricature  of  a  million  individuals, 
Those  of  you  in  britain, will  know  about  What's  become  rather  a  celebrated  case  of  a  woman  called  sally  clark  who  had  two  babies  who  died  suddenly  
And  to  argue, then  that  the  chance  of  a  second  death  is  as  if  you  Didn't  know  that  information  is  really  silly.
One  of  them  is  that  sally  clark  was  innocent  --  which  is  a  priori  overwhelmingly  likely  --  most  mothers  Don't  kill  their  children.
So  just  to  conclude  --  what  are  the  take-home  messages  from  this  
We  are  not  good  at  reasoning  with  uncertainty.
All  of  quality  control, which  has  had  a  major  impact  on  industrial  processing  is  underpinned  by  statistics.
This  is  a  world-changing  invention.
Well, it  turns  out  that  the  main  causes  are  faulty  and  Misused  appliances  and  electrical  wiring  
Hmmm  
So  far  We've  applied  for  414  patent  claims  
So  to  conclude  intelligent  power  can  globally, save  thousands  of  lives, prevent  tens  of  thousands  of  injuries  and  eliminate  tens  of  billions  of  dollars  in  property  damage  every  single  year, while  significantly  reducing  global  energy  consumption, 
In  the  spirit  of  this  Year's  ted  conference, we  think  this  is  a  powerful  world-changing  invention, 
And  That's  what  I'd  like  to  talk  to  you  a  little  bit  about  today.
It's  acoustic  vibrations  in  the  air, little  waves  of  energy  in  the  air  that  tickle  our  eardrum  
And  It's  at  the  hair  cell  level  that  they  do  this  
In  fact, nothing  even  actually  comes  close  to  our  ability  to  restore  hearing  
And  as  a  physician  and  a  surgeon, i  can  Confidently  tell  my  patients  that  if  you  had  to  pick  a  sense  to  lose, we  are  the  furthest  along  medically  and  surgically  with  hearing  
Okay, play  that  video: please  
I'm, saying  that  They're  going  to  face  obstacles  that  most  people  who  have  normal  hearing  will  not  have  to  face  
Now, hearing  loss  and  the  treatment  for  hearing  loss  has  really  evolved  in  the  past  200  years, 
I  mean, literally, they  used  to  do  things  like  stick  Ear-shaped  objects  onto  your  ears  and  stick  funnels  in  
Language  is  very  different  language  is  very  precise  
In  fact, the  whole  reason  we  use  it  is  because  it  has  Semantic-specificity  
But  it  certainly  Wasn't  the  way  the  music  was  intended  
What  that  suggests  is  that  even  in  the  case  of  hearing  loss, the  capacity  for  music  remains  
And  Here's  a  video  of  joseph  
Joseph  i  was  born  in  1986  
When  i  was  12  years  old, i  was  one  of  the  first  few  people  in  singapore  who  underwent  cochlear  Implantation  
And  this  is  really  unheard  of  stuff.
You  Don't  actually  have  to  hear  it  
I  know  he  Doesn't  hear  well, because  I've  heard  him  do  Karaoke  
And  so  this  idea  has  a  lot  of  traction  with  us.
And  so  I'm  here  to  tell  you, you  Don't  need  a  computer  to  actually  have  a  spell. In  fact, what  you  can  do  at  the  molecular  level  is  that  if  you  encode  information  --  you  encode  a  spell  or  program  as  molecules  --  then  physics  can  actually  directly  interpret  that  information  and  run  a  program. That's.
When  this  amino  acid  sequence  gets  pronounced  as  atoms, these  little  letters  are  sticky  for  each  other  
So  Here's  a  shape  i  actually  spent  about  a  year  in  my  home  in  my  underwear  coding, like  linus  [torvalds]  in  that  picture  before  
I  mix  them  together, add  a  little  bit  of  salt  water. And  then  add  this  long  strand  i  was  telling  you  about  that  I've  stolen  from  a  virus. And  then  what  happens  is  you  heat  this  whole  thing  up  to  about  boiling  you  cool  it  down  to  room  temperature. And  as  you  do  what  happens  is  those  short  strands  they  do  the  following  thing, each  one  of  them, binds  that  long  strand  in  one  place, and  then  has  a  second  half  that  binds  that  long  strand  in  a  distant  place, and  brings  those  two  parts  of  the  long  strand  close  together, so  that  they  stick  together.
You  can  make  a  molecule  that  looks  like  this. And, you  know, he  likes  to  hang  out  with  his  buddies  right?
So  That's  dna, origami  That's, one  way, there  are  many  ways  of  casting  molecular  spells  using  dna  
I  did  not  choose  to  take  up  the  pen, the  brush, the  camera  
Why  did  i  choose  the  gun  as  my  instrument?
My  father  was  a  hardworking  baker.
My  father  was  there  to  provide  it  
He  fired  nothing  happened.
The  murder  rate  in  europe  has  dropped  by  a  factor  of  30  since  the  middle  ages, 
Why  has  violence  decreased  
Or  is  there  something  else? ?
The  armed  forces: implement  the  state  monopoly  on  violence, 
My  soldiers  use  the  gun  as  an  instrument  of  peace.
And  that  is  why  --  and  in  the  netherlands, we  are  very  unique  in  that  --  that  is  why  the  dutch  constitution  states  that  one  of  the  main  tasks  of  the  armed  forces  is  to  uphold  and  promote  the  international  rule  of  law  
And  i  hope  that  one  day, armies  can  be  Disbanded, and  humans  will  find  a  way  of  living  together  without  violence  and  oppression  
I  hope  you  will  support  our  soldiers  when  they  are  out  there  when  they  come  home.
You're  climbing  on  little  Dimples  and  Nubbins  in  the  rock  
Women  are  much  more  in  balance  because  they  Don't  have  that  idea  that  They're  going  to  be  able  to  do  100  Pull-ups  
They  think  about  how  to  get  the  weight  over  their  feet  because  It's  sort  of  natural  --  they  carry  you  all  day, long, 
It  took  us  15  years  to  sequence  hiv  --  we  sequenced  sars  in  31  days, 
If  you  put  different  communication  technologies  on  this  logarithmic  graph  television  radio, telephone  were  adopted  in  decades.
Now, by  the  way, if  you  look  at  this  on  a  linear  graph, it  looks  like  everything  has  just  happened. But  some  observer  says, well, kurzweil  just  put  points  on  this  graph  that  fall  on  that  straight  line.
And  again, it  forms  the  same  straight  line. You  have  a  little  bit  of  thickening  in  the  line  because  people  do  have  Disagreements  what  the  key  points  are.
It  took  us  three  years  to  double  our  price  performance  of  computing  in  1900, two  years  in  the  middle  We're.
Supercomputers  --  same  thing: 
You  would  think  it  would  be  a  very  Erratic  process, and  you  have  a  very  smooth  outcome  of  this  chaotic  process.
As  we  make  them  smaller  and  less  expensive, the  electrons  have  less  distance  to  travel  
And  economists  have  actually  started  worrying  about  that  
This  is  due  to  greater  productivity.
These  were  evolved  in  very  different  times  --  We'd, like  to  actually  change  those  programs.
We'd  like  to  actually  turn  that  program  off  
Four  or  five  pharmaceutical  companies  have  noticed  this  felt  that  would  be  interesting  drug  for  the  human  market  and  That's, just  one  of  the  30000  genes  that  affect  our  biochemistry  
For  example, we  can  inhibit  genes  now  with  rna  interference  
It's  now, under  a  10th  of  a  cent  
Once  we  understand  its  principles  of  operation  and  the  pace  with  which  we  are  Reverse-engineering  biology  is  accelerating. We  can  actually  design  these  things  to  be  thousands  of  times  more  capable.
Where  will  we  get  the  software  
Wall  street  noticed  that  this  was  a  revolutionary  technology, which  it  was. But  then  six  months  later  when  it  Hadn't  revolutionized  all  business  models, they  figured, well, that  was  wrong.
Images  will  be  written  directly  to  our  retina, providing  Full-immersion  virtual  reality, augmented  real  reality, We'll  be  interacting  with  virtual  personalities  
You  can  go  there  with  other  people  have  any  kind  of  experience  with  anyone  involving  all  of  the  senses.
But  most  importantly, It'll  be  a  tremendous  expansion  of  human  intelligence  through  this  direct  merger  with  our  technology, which, in  some  sense, We're  doing  already  
It's, just  like  this  one  completely  worthless  in  which  it  allegedly  worked  by  Electrostatic  magnetic  ion  attraction, which  translates  to  Pseudoscientific  baloney  --  would  be  the  nice  word  --  in  which  you  string  together  a  bunch  of  words  that  sound  good.
In  this  case, at  trespass  points, allowing  people  to  go  through  because  your  little  tracker  device  said  they  were  okay, actually  cost  lives.
And  in  fact, i  think  my  thesis  here  is  that  belief  is  the  natural  state  of  things.
And  That's  called  superstition, and  that  I'm  afraid  we  will  always  have  with  us.
You  are  a  hominid  three  million  years  ago, walking  on  the  plains  of  africa, 
You've  been  taken  out  of  the  gene  pool

And  if  you  give  them  drugs  that  are  dopamine  antagonists, they  go  away  
Every  time  somebody  looks  at  you, you  think  people  are  staring  at  you.
Because  the  lights  on  here, 
So  what  you  see  in  this  particular  ambiguous, figure  is, of  course, the  dolphins  right  
That's  a  dolphin  tail  there  guys  
So  you  recognize  obama  immediately  
And  this  is  also, i  think  the  basis  of  conspiracy  theories  
Explains  a  lot, maybe  
Well, That's  a  whole  other  lecture  
We  know  that  if  you  stimulate  the  temporal  lobe, you  can  produce  a  feeling  of  out-of-body  experiences, near-death  experiences, which  you  can  do  by  just  touching  an  electrode  to  the  temporal  lobe.
And  you  get  a  sense  of  out-of-body  experience, 
It  ties  together  all  this  into  the  power  of  expectation  and  the  power  of  belief  
Okay, now, I'm  going  to  ask  you  to  Pucker  up  
Pucker  up  big  and  lean  in  just  a  little  bit.
Jennifer, the  man  came  and  started  Undressing  me,

Text, uganda, Ratified  the  convention  against  torture, in  1986  
Torture  is  defined  as  any  act  by  which  severe  pain  of  suffering, whether  physical  or  mental  is  intentionally  inflicted  by  a  person  acting  in  an  official  capacity  to  obtain  information  or  a  confession  to  punish  Coerce  or  Intimidate  
And  as  the  story  of  mr  Morales  just  down  the  road, excuse  me, mr  gabriel: would  you  mind  if  we  delayed  your  execution, a  little  bit  
Witness  
There  could  be  a  new  movement, growing  up  rising  from  the  ground  reaching  for  the  light  and  growing  strong, just  like  a  tree.
So  in  that  18  minutes  or  10  minutes  or  five  minutes, you  have  to  convey  a  whole  bunch  of  different  characteristics.
Next  up  is  knowledge.
You  walk  in  the  door.
And  everything  has  got  to  be  Reinforcing.
Okay, so  how  do  you  do  that  
Well, first  of  all  logical  progression, 
You've  also  got  to  let  me  know  that  there  are  Touchstones  
You  want  to  tie  in  to  the  rest  of  the  world  out  there  
So  this  all  feeds  in  together, 
You  want  absolute  --  this  is  the  zen  of  presentation, right? .
So  with  that  said, we  only  have  a  very, very  short  time.
You  do  that  you  give  me  your  quick  15-second  or  30-second, Intro  grab  my  attention.
We  build  widgets  for  the  x, y, z  market  
If  It's  a  website  show  me  a  screenshot  of  your  website, 
Five  is  a  bit  much, probably  four  is  rational  
And  i  look  at  the  logo  --  okay, good  
Powerpoint  has  this  built  into  every  copy  of  powerpoint  That's, shipped  
And  the  number  one  presentation  tip  never  ever  look  at  the  screen.
And  that  is  how  to  pitch  to  a  vc  
I'm  here  today  to  start  a  revolution, 
Now  before  you  get  up  in  arms, or  you  break  into  song  or  you  pick  a  favorite  color, i  want  to  define  what  i  mean  by  revolution.
We're  last  place  in  health  care  and  That's  important  for  a  sense  of  well-being.
That's  social  Let's, look  at  education, 
Because  It's  shown  the  way  we  apply  generate  and  use  knowledge  is  affected  by  our  social  and  institutional  context, which  told  us  what  in  communism  
It's  a  serious  gene  
True  story  i  went  looking  for  a  school  for  my  kid.
It  Can't  be  because  of  play  
Throughout  the  animal  kingdom, for  example, ants  ants  play  
Kittens  play, we  all  know, kittens  play  
And  It's, not  just  kids  It's  adults  too  
These  guys  are  facts.
The  opposite  of  play  is  not  work.
Just  like  There's  benefits  for  humans  and  animals  There's  benefits  for  play  at  work  
You  know, the  professional  athlete  that  loves  skiing  He's  serious  about  it, but  he  loves  it.
A  doctor  might  be  serious, but  Laughter's, still  a  great  medicine  
You  guys  have  to  and  if  You're  not  feeling  it, your  colleagues, your  employees, Aren't  going  to  feel  it  
Fear  is  the  enemy  of  play  
Let  them  take  long  Lunches  
What  we  need  is  a  Players'  uprising.
What  we  need  is  a  Players'  uprising.
What  we  need  is  a  Players'  uprising.
And  i  am  illustrating  still  
Which  of  course, i  am  not  agreeing  with  because, although  i  am  94, i  am  not  still  working  
I  still  have  --  or  did  i  use  the  word  still?
These  were  just  some  of  the  things  I've  made  
These  are  tiles. The  word  playful  is  a  necessary  aspect  of  our  work. Because  actually  one  of  our  problems  is  that  we  have  to  make  produce  lovely  things  throughout  all  of  life. And  this  for  me  is  now  75  years.
So, how  can  you  without  drying  up, make  things  with  the  same  pleasure  as  a  gift  to  others  for  so  long  
I  started  as  an  apprentice  to  a  hungarian  craftsman.
We  mashed  the  clay  with  our  feet  when  it  came  from  the  hillside  
And  finally, i  had  received  a  document  that  i  had  accomplished  my  Apprenticeship  successfully  that  i  had  behaved  morally.
I  also  got  at  the  time, a  Workbook, which  explained  my  rights  and  my  working  conditions.
My  mother  thought  that  this  was  not  very  proper, so  she  sat  with  us  to  add  Propriety  to  this  activity.
However, the  director  the  chemist  model  maker  --  everybody  --  concerned  himself, much  more  with  the  art  department  --  that  means  with  my  work  --  than  making  toilets. So  finally  they  got  a  letter  from  the  center  from  the  bank  who  owned  the  factory, saying, make  Toilet-setting  behind  the  art  department. And  that  was  my  end.
So  i  will  try  speed  it  up  a  little  moderator: eva.
The  Accusation  was  that  i  had  successfully  prepared  an  Attentat  on  Stalin's  life.
But  since  i  survived  and  I'm  here, and  since  this  is  the  end  of  the  five  minutes  i  will  --  moderator, tell  me  when  your  last  trip  to  russia  was  
Oh  this  summer, in  fact, the  Lomonosov  factory  was  bought  by  an  american  company, invited  me  
That's  my  camera  lens, the  first  one  --  the  one  i  shot  my  bob  dylan  film  with  35  years  ago.
I  called  my  sister, i  called  my  neighbors.
That's, my  sister  she  took  care  of  pictures, because  i  was  a  big  collector  of  snapshot  photography, that  i  believed  said  a  lot  
She's  still  there  She's  there, this  morning  actually  
And  we  went  into  parenting  expecting  our  lives  to  look  like  this  
The  nurse  was  coming  at  me  with  this  beautiful, beautiful  child. And  i  remember, as  she  was  approaching  me, the  voices  of  friends, saying, the  moment  they  put  the  baby  in  your  hands. You  will  feel  a  sense  of  love  that  will  come  over  you. That  is  [on]  an  order  of  magnitude  more  powerful  than  anything  You've  ever  experienced  in  your  entire  life.
And  it  was  also, of  course, surreal  
You're  either  in  love  or  You're, not  in  love  
I  enjoyed  being  pregnant, i  loved  it  
Of  those  67  percent  are  most  lonely  when  their  kids  are  zero  to  five  --  probably  really  zero  to  two  
In  the  process  of  preparing  this, we  looked  at  how  some  other  cultures  around  the  world  deal  with  this  period  of  time. Because  here  in  the  western  world, less  than  50  percent  of  us  live  near  our  family  members, which  i  think  is  part  of  why  this  is  such  a  tough  period.
The  party  line  is  that  every  single  aspect  of  my  life  has  just  gotten  dramatically  better  ever  since  i  participated  in  the  miracle  that  is  childbirth  and  family  
As  you  get  older, you  become  more  stable.
You  start  to  realize  that, hey, i  could  go  to  this  live  music  event  and  have  an  utterly  transforming  experience  that  will  cover  my  entire  body  with  goosebumps, but  It's, more  likely  that  I'll  feel  Claustrophobic.
So  your  average  happiness  goes  up, but  you  lose  those  transcendent  moments  
But  you  realize  you  Resubmit  yourself  to  losing  control  in  a  really  wonderful  way, which  we  think  provides  a  lot  of  meaning  to  our  lives  and  is  quite  gratifying  
We  trade  the  sort  of  security  and  safety  of  a  certain  level  of  Contentment  for  these  transcendent  moments  
So  where  does  that  leave  the  two  of  us  as  a  family  with  our  three  little  boys  in  the  thick  of  all  this  
There's  another  factor, in  our  case, 
And  we  had  reservations  about  this  on  the  front  end, 
Get  out  of  the  airplane, it  turns  out  You're  trekking  in  nepal, 
Rg  +  av: thank  you  
We  crave  to  be  in  the  room  with  the  musician, the  day  it  was  recorded  the  day. It  was  played  .
And  we  go  to  live  concerts, and  we  get  that  as  much  as  we  can  
And  Yamaha  makes  an  incredible  thing  called  the  Disklavier  pro  that  looks  like  a  nice  grand  piano. There.
He  just  got  tired  of  being  in  front  of  an  audience  and  felt  like  --  a  performing  monkey  was, in  fact, his  term  
His  maybe  most  famous  recording  was  something  called  the  goldberg  variations.
He  wrote  some  early  pieces, but  late  in  his  life  in  his  mature  period, he  said, Here's  a  theme  --  30  variations  
And  gould  recorded  it  in  two  major  recordings  that  you  may  know  about  one  in  Mono  and  one  in  stereo  
What  I'd  like  you  to  hear  live  is  the  1955  version  and  We'll  play.
So  in  the  video  world  We've  been  able  to  invent  in  our  lifetimes  natural  behavior.
And  when  you  put  on  headphones  and  you  listen  to  this  You're  inside  of  glenn  Gould's, body, 
Your  eyes  are  pretty  happy  with  some  color  and  movement.
You  want  to  hear  it  in  different  rooms  and  whatever  
We  made  a  new  recording  of  him  playing  in  the  shrine  auditorium  in  september  ,
And  fortunately, It's, right  in  here, 
I  want  to  start  just  by  saying  a  bit  about  where  I'm  coming  from  
I  trained  briefly  as  a  buddhist  monk  under  this  guy.
And  although  that  was  great  for  the  music  business  at  the  time, it  Wasn't  much  good  for  anything  else.
Unprecedented  wealth  and  prosperity, but  that  growth  Hasn't  always  delivered  what  we  needed  
Rates  of  depression  carried  on  up  right  across  the  western  world.
They  bring  ideas  from  the  margins  into  the  mainstream  
Ronald  reagan  again, said, the  two  funniest  sentences  in  the  english  language  are  I'm  from  the  government  and  I'm  here  to  help  
And  i  think  more  and  more  people  are  also  asking  why  boost  consumption  rather  than  change  what  we  consume  
It's, not  that  our  scientists  are  necessarily  much  smarter  than  they  were  a  hundred  years  ago. Maybe  they  are, but  they  have  a  hell  of  a  lot  more  backing  than  they  ever  did.
And  he  believed  we  live  with  others. We  share  the  world  with  others, and  therefore  our  innovation  must  be  done  with  others, too, not  doing  things  at  people  for  them.
Others  are  much  more  pragmatic  health  coaches, learning  mentors  job, clubs  ,
Now, the  idea  that  all  of  this  represents, i  think, is  rapidly  becoming  a  common  sense  and  part  of  how  we  respond  to  the  crisis, recognizing  the  need  to  invest  in  innovation  for  social  progress  as  well  as  technological  progress  ,
There  were  big  health  innovation  funds  launched  earlier  this  year  in  this  country  as  well  as  a  public  service, innovation  lab  
And  if  a  generation  or  two  ago, the  big  challenges  were  ones  like  getting  a  man  on  the  moon, perhaps  the  challenges  we  need  to  set  ourselves. Now  are  ones  like  eliminating  child, malnutrition, stopping  trafficking  or  one. I   think  closer  to  home  for  america  or  europe. Why  Don't?
Now, those  are  all  goals  which  could  be  achieved  within  a  decade, but  only  with  radical  and  systematic  experiment  not  just  with  technologies, but  also  with  lifestyles  and  culture  and  policies  and  institutions  too  
History  was  over  and  society  would  inevitably  have  to  take  second  place  to  economy.
Just  as  today, the  Enthusiasts  of  Unrestrained, capitalism, say, It's  rooted  in  human  nature, only  now  It's  Individualism  Inquisitiveness  and  so  on  
You  think, I've  lost  my  way  and  Somebody's  going  to  come  on  the  stage  in  a  minute  and  guide  me, gently  back  to  my  seat  
I  want  to  tell  you  about  my  friend  who  was  teaching  english  to  adults  in  abu  dhabi, 
And  one  fine  day, she  decided  to  take  them  into  the  garden  to  teach  them  some  nature  vocabulary  
A  language  dies  every  14  days  
That  is  a  little  bit  too  early  
We  were  brought  to  teach  english  because  the  government  wanted  to  Modernize  the  country  and  to  empower  the  citizens  through  education, 
But  if  You're  not  a  native  speaker, you  have  to  pass  a  test  
Do  we  really  want  to  end  up  with  600  languages  and  the  main  one  being  english  or  chinese  
And  i  want  to  remind  you  that  the  giants  upon  whose  shoulders  Today's  intelligentsia  stand  did  not  have  to  have  english. They  Didn't  have  to  pass  an  english  test.
Let  me  tell  you  a  story  about  two  scientists: two  english.
So  he  invented  a  Cost-free  solar  lamp  
When  he  received  his  award, he  said, these  lovely  words, the  children  can  lead  africa  from  what  it  is. Today.
I  am  known  best  for  human-powered  flight.
And  we  thought  a  solar-powered  plane  Wouldn't  really, make  sense, but  you  could  do  it, and  it  would  get  a  lot  of  publicity  for  solar  power  and  maybe  help  that  field  
You  Don't  need  to  dig  down  for  these  chemicals, and  we  can  do  things  much  more  efficiently.
So  this  just  summarizes  it  over  billions  of  years  on  a  unique  sphere, chance  has  painted  a  thin  covering  of  life  --  complex  and  probable, wonderful  and  fragile  
Suddenly  we  humans  a  recently  arrived  species, no  longer  subject  to  the  checks  and  balances  inherent  in  nature  have  grown  in  population  technology  and  intelligence  to  a  position  of  terrible  power.
Okay  and  Let's  have  the  next  
And  then  also, like  it  said  in  the  video, you  can  turn  it  left  or  right, just  by  putting  the  lift  under  one  wing  or  another  
And  That's  it.
Most  of  the  talks  that  You've  heard  in  the  last  several  fabulous  days  have  been  from  people  who  have  the  characteristic  that  they  have  thought  about  something  they  are  experts, they  know  What's  going  on  
All  of  you  know, about  the  topic  that  I'm  supposed  to  talk  about  
Well, it  enables  you  to  drink  coffee  
And  the  other, of  course, is  a  birth  control  pill, which, in  a  very  simple  way, fundamentally  changed  the  structure  of  society  by  changing  the  role  of  women  in  it  by  providing  to  them  the  opportunity  to  make  reproductive  choices.
It's  like, what  is  simplicity?
What  is  the  state  of  science?
And  interestingly, complexity  is  very  highly  evolved  
One  of  the  things  i  want  to  do  is  to  help  you  with  a  very  important  task  --  which  you  may  not  know  that  you  have  very  often  --  which  is  to  understand  how  to  sit  next  to  a  physicist  at  a  dinner  party  and  have  a  conversation  
And  the  words  that  i  would  like  you  to  focus  on  are  complexity  and  emergence, because  these  will  enable  you  to  start  the  conversation.
And  That's  complexity, 
All  right.
The  question  is, why  is  binary  simpler  than  arabic?
And  this  is  a  map  of  Bitflows  across  the  continent  
That  is  you  can  stack  them.
And  you  put  a  drop  in  this  case  of  urine  at  the  bottom  
It  turns  colors, in  this  particular  case, You're  reading  kidney  function  
If  you  take  too  much  out  of  something  That's, simple, you  lose  function.
So  you  Can't  make  it  too  simple  
And  the  second  is  a  design  issue  and  It's  not  directly  relevant, but  It's  a  nice  statement.
So  what  i  think  one  can  begin  to  do  with  this  kind  of  cut  at  the  word, simplicity  which  Doesn't  cover  Brancusi. It  Doesn't  answer.
You've  got  a  company  set  up  to  
I  want  to  open  by  quoting  Einstein's, wonderful  statement: just  so  people  will  feel  at  ease  that  the  great  scientist  of  the  20th  century  also  agrees  with  us  and  also  calls  us  to  this  action.
I  know  the  next  buddha  will  come  a  few  thousand  years  from  now  but  exists  currently  in  a  certain  heaven  --  That's  maitreya  --  so  I'm  going  to  go  on  a  retreat  and  I'm  going  to  meditate  and  pray  until  the  buddha  maitreya  reveals  himself  to  me  and  gives  me  a  teaching  or  something  to  revive  the  practice  of  compassion  in  the  world  today.
And  the  man  said, really, and  he  showed  him  a  dish  full  of  needles.
So  he  said, okay, i  get  the  point  
He  went  back  to  his  cave.
Another  three  years, no  vision. He  leaves  again.
So  he  thought  i  will  take  the  maggots  and  put  them  on  this  piece  of  flesh, then  clean  the  Dog's  wounds, and  then  I'll  figure  out  what  to  do  with  the  maggots.
So  he  starts  to  do  that.
He  jumps  back.
So  as  he  comes  up  from  his  first  bow, he  says, my  lord  I'm  so  happy  to  see  you. But  where  have  you  been  for  12  years?
And  maitreya  says, i  was  with  you  who  do  you  think  was  making  needles  and  making  nests  and  dripping  on  rocks  for  you, mister  dense  
Looking  for  the  buddha  in  person, he  said, 
So  naturally, they  chased  him  out  of  town.
You  gave  me  that  expression  the  eternal, mama, you  said, That's, wonderful  
So  they  first  create  this  foundation  of  equality  
And  we  Don't  hate  anyone  therefore.
And  this  is  the  way  you  do  it. You  take  any  being  who  looks  weird  to  you, and  you  see  how  they  could  be  familiar  to  you.
You  reduce  the  feeling  of  otherness  about  beings  
And  then  you  connect  that  with  your  feeling  that  everyone  has  that  motherly  possibility  
And  they  then  never  get  any  positive  feedback  
Compassion  makes  you  happy  
The  first  person  who  is  happy  when  you  get  great  compassion  is  yourself, even  if  you  Haven't  done  anything  yet  for  anybody  else.
Because  traditional  economic  theory  would  say, well, the  mountain  bike  was  probably  invented  by  some  big  bike  corporation  that  had  a  big  R&ampd  lab  where  they  were  thinking  up  new  projects. And  it  came  out  of  there. It  Didn't  come  from  there.
The  ideas  are  coming  back  from  the  consumers  and  They're  often  ahead  of  the  producers  
The  very  first  landline  telephones, the  inventors  thought  that  they  would  be  used  for  people  to  listen  in  to  live  performances  from  west  end  theaters, 
More  and  more  the  inventors  of  things  will  not  be  able  to  say  that  in  advance, 
The  second  reason  why  users  are  more  and  more  important  is  that  they  are  the  source  of  big  disruptive  innovations, 
Take  astronomy  as  an  example, which  yochai  has  already  mentioned  
What  does  this  mean?
Let  me  just  give  you  two  examples.
Which  venture  capitalist  in  their  right  mind  is  going  to  give  you  any  money  to  set  up  a  venture  competing  with  microsoft  with  microsoft  outlook.
Because  the  professionals  over  here, in  these  closed  organizations  --  they  might  be  academics, they  might  be  programmers. They  might  be  doctors. They  might  be  journalists  --  my  former  profession  --  say, no, no  --  you  Can't  trust.
They  want  to  as  jimmy  said, they  want  to  have  a  dialogue  a  conversation  
What  should  be  the  role  of  public  policy  
And  i  was  having  dinner  with  this  guy  called  timothy  Chan, 
Didn't  go  into  the  internet, kept  his  money, decided  to  go  into  computer  games.
At  any  one  time, there  are  four  million  people  playing  one  of  his  games.
How  many  people  does  he  employ  to  service  that  population  
Well, how  can  he  service  250  million  people  from  500  employees  
Imagine  you  could  take  all  the  children  in  education  in  britain, and  one  percent  of  them  were  co-developers  of  education.
Or  if  you  got  one  percent  of  the  patients  in  the  Nhs  to  in  some  sense, be  Co-producers  of  health  
For  example, i  get  people  to  dress  up  their  vacuum  cleaners, 
And  i  figured  I'd  put  it  on  the  internet  for  all  employees  under  stress  to  help  you  better  deal  with  what  You're  going  through  on  your  job.
And  so  i  said, Let's  put  this  together  in  an  album  
We  can  build  all  sorts  of  environments  to  make  it  a  little  bit  easier.
Recording, okay, Here's  something  
But  sometimes  i  feel  really  lonely  
Like  even  people  in  convenience  stores  saying  have  a  nice  day  when  They're  accidentally  looking  me  in  the  eye  
And  i  got  a  lot  like  30  in  a  half  an  hour  
I  was  like, i  Don't  know  
But  anyway, this  same  person  laura  ended  up  emailing  me  a  little  bit  after  that  project.
So  i  asked  her, what  does  it  feel  like  when  you  feel  this  way?
I  said, okay, I'll  think  about  it  
And  when  you  put  them  together, something  magical  happens, something  absolutely  incredible  happens. And  all  of  a  sudden  i  get  a  chorus  from  around  the  world.
And  over  the  past  35  years, I've  studied  behavior  on  the  basis  of  everything  from  genes  through  neurotransmitters  dopamine  things  like  that.
It's  really  a  very  precisely  timed  thing.
So  there  is  the  pattern  that  every  one  of  them  had, but  they  all  were  a  little  different  too  .
A  key  thing  is  that  the  major  violence  genes  It's  called  the  Mao-a  gene, 
It's  on  the  x  chromosome. And  so  in  this  way, you  can  only  get  it  from  your  mother.
And  what  i  think  might  happen  in  these  areas  of  the  world  where  we  have  constant  violence, you  end  up  having  generations  of  kids  that  are  seeing  all  this  violence.
Now  i  said, okay, so  what  we  have  Lizzie  
But  it  Doesn't  stop  there  
But  There's  Gonna  be  bad  news  somewhere, 
It's  the  biggest  scientific  experiment  ever  attempted  
So  you  might  be  asking, why  
Absolutely  everything  
Actually  if  you  just  look  at  your  thumbnail  --  about  a  square  centimeter  --  there  are  something  like  60  billion  neutrinos  per  second  from  the  sun, passing  through  every  square  centimeter  of  your  body  
And  these  particles  have  been  discovered  over  the  last  century, pretty  much  
One  of  the  wonderful  things, actually, i  find  is  that  We've  discovered  any  of  them  when  you  realize  how  tiny  they  are  
So  one  of  my  most  illustrious  Forebears  at  manchester  university, ernest  Rutherford  Discoverer  of  the  atomic  nucleus  once  said, all  science  is  either  physics  or  stamp  collecting  
Now, i  Don't  think  he  meant  to  insult  the  rest  of  science, although  he  was  from  new  zealand.
But  imagine  someone  Who's  not  very  popular  moves  through  the  room  
The  picture  is  that  the  electrons  and  the  quarks  in  your  body  and  in  the  universe  that  we  see  around  us  are  heavy  in  a  sense  and  massive  because  They're  surrounded  by  higgs  particles, 
This  is  a  creation  story.
So  That's, the  lhc  
When  i  grew  up  and  realized  that  science  fiction  was  not  a  good  source  for  superpowers, i  decided  instead  to  embark  on  a  journey  of  real  science  to  find  a  more  useful  truth.
By  measuring  their  student  smiles, researchers  were  able  to  predict  how  fulfilling  and  Long-lasting  a  Subject's  marriage  will  be  how  well  she  would  score  on  standardized  tests  of  well-being  and  how  inspiring  she  would  be  to  others.
Outside  of  this  room, more  than  a  third  of  us  smile  more  than  20  times  per  day, whereas  less  than  14  percent  of  us  smile, less  than  five  
The  finding  supported  Darwin's  theory  by  showing  that  facial  feedback  Modifies  the  neural  processing  of  emotional  content  in  the  brain  in  a  way  that  helps  us  feel  better  when  we  smile  
It  is  a  User-appropriate  technology  that  has  been  used  for  humanitarian  good  to  great  effect.
The  grassroots  has  been  Strengthened  through  the  social  power  of  sharing, and  they  are  challenging  the  old  models, the  old  analog  models  of  control  and  command  
If  you  were  to  arrive  in  nairobi  today  and  pick  up  a  tourist  map, kibera  is  represented  as  a  lush, green  national  park, devoid  of  human  settlement  
They're  normally  Backroom  or  basement  hardware  service  providers, but  they  need  to  be  elevated  to  software  strategists  
But  if  You're  like  me, my  humanity  is  more  like  a  window  
Then  suddenly  i  see  it  and  usually  It's  never  good  
My  mother  was  english  
She  was  five  foot  two, very  feisty  and  very  english  
This  is  how  english  my  mother  is  --  or  was  she  just  passed  
And  then  we  went  to  a  fish  restaurant, and  we  had  chad, the  Surfer, dude  serving  us. And  he  came  up, and  my  mother  said, do  you  have  any  Specials  young?
And  my  mother  turned  to  me  and  said, what  language  is  he  speaking  
But  her  igbo  Wasn't, too  good  
So  here  are  these  women  who  never  discuss  their  period  with  their  husbands. And  here  i  am  telling  them. Well, how  often  do  you  get  your  period?
It  was  my  mother  with  five  little  children  
Can  you  imagine  this  Five-foot-two  woman  standing  up  to  men  with  guns  who  want  to  kill  us  
And  she  said, you  know, you  can  steel  your  heart  against  any  kind  of  trouble.
And  then  the  next  planting  season, when  they  sang  the  Dirge, they  would  remove  as  many  names  of  the  dead  that  Equaled  as  many  people  that  were  born  
Which  would  seem  to  suggest  that  apartheid  was  entirely  the  business  of  men.
Their  humanity  never  seems  to  matter  very  much  to  us.
And  a  lot  of  rituals  involved  killing  killing  little  animals  progressing  along. So  when  i  turned  13  --  and  i  mean, it  made  sense. It  was  an  agrarian  community. Somebody  had  to  kill  the  animals. There  was  no  whole  foods. You  could  go  and  get  kangaroo  steak  at  --  so  when  i  turned  13, it  was  my  turn  now  to  kill  a  goat.
Now  when  i  was  growing  up, he  used  to  tell  me  stories  about  how  he  used  to  Bayonet  people  and  their  Intestines  would  fall  out, but  they  would  keep  running  .
But  he  was  desperate  to  show  that  He'd  just  come  back. So  he  summoned  me  up, and  he  said, go  into  the  bedroom.
That's  basically  how  this  thing  operates  
So  one  of  the  advantages  of  this  design  is, when  you  scale  things  down, the  robot, naturally  becomes  agile  
It's, inversely  proportional  to  r  
No  matter  how  you  throw  it  the  robot  recovers  and  comes  back  to  him.
So  here  are  robots  carrying  beams  columns  and  assembling  Cube-like  structures  
So  you  might  want  to  have  multiple  robots  carry  Payloads  
So  we  use  a  little  trick  
They  sense  their  neighbors, 
So, again, the  robots  monitor  this  error  and  calculate  the  control  commands, 100  times  a  second, which  then  translates  to  the  motor  commands, 600  times  a  second  
As  you  can  see  here  they  collapse  from  a  three-dimensional  formation  into  planar  formation.
Another  application  i  want  to  show  you  --  again, this  is  in  our  lab  
So  his  algorithm  essentially  tells  these  robots  how  to  autonomously  build  cubic  structures  from  Truss-like  elements, 
So  all  these  experiments  You've  seen  thus  far  all  these  demonstrations  have  been  done  with  the  help  of  motion  capture  systems.
It  figures  out  where  it  is  with  respect  to  the  features  and  then  estimates  its  position  100  times  a  second  allowing  us  to  use  the  control  algorithms  that  i  described  to  you  earlier.
You  will  see  nine.
Let's  watch  
Unless  You're  on  one  of  these  californian  Low-carb  diets, bread  is  standard  
And  i  think  it  is  because  we  feel  that  this  kind  of  bread  really  is  about  authenticity.
And  this  is  about  good  taste  good  traditions, 
But  we  have  somehow  in  the  course  of  the  last  few  centuries, or  even  decades, started  to  cultivate  an  image  of  a  mythical  rural  agricultural  past  
So  what  is  happening  
Bread  has  migrated  to  tropical  countries  where  the  middle  classes  now  eat  french  rolls  and  hamburgers, and  where  the  Commuters  find  bread  much  more  handy  to  use  than  rice  or  cassava  
This  is  where  it  all  comes  from, and  where  these  farmers  who  actually  ten  thousand  years  ago, put  us  on  the  road  of  bread  
Let's  go  back  to  traditional  farming, 
And  I'm  making  a  real  plea  here.
We've  moved  towards  large-scale  and  very  high  control.
What  i  want  us  to  do  is  to  keep  up  the  science  and  even  get  more  science  in  there, but  go  to  a  kind  of  regional  scale  --  not  just  in  terms  of  the  scale  of  the  fields.
So, what  kind  of  science  can  we  have  
We  Cannot  solve  the  world  food  problem  by  using  biological  agriculture.
Everything  is  linked  together, 
Understand  that  you  are  part  of  this  enormous  chain  of  events, 
And  as  you  eat  it  and  as  you  try  it  --  please  come  and  stand  up  
Every  meal  you  eat  contains  ingredients  from  all  across  the  world.
And  that  i  think  Evolutionarily-speaking  is  unique  
And  today  is  a  time  for  me  to  talk  to  you  about  water.
This  crocodile, which  grows  to  almost  20  feet  long  in  the  northern  rivers.
And  it  really  works  to  start  with  them.
The  people  of  this  part  of  india  worship  the  king  cobra, 
It's  just  a  Wresting  match, but  a  remarkable  activity  
And  now  the  king  cobra  is  a  new  one  
It  survived, even  during  the  time  that  the  dinosaurs  died  off  
In  fact, if  you  see  the  map, the  range  of  their  original  habitat  was  all  the  way  from  the  indus  in  pakistan  to  the  Irrawaddy  in  burma  
And  pretty  soon  we  were  seeing  sights  like  this  
This  was  actually  just  taken  last  year  
My  pals  in  the  crocodile  specialist  group  of  the  iucn, the  [madras  crocodile  Bank], an  ngo, the  world  wildlife  fund, the  wildlife  institute  of  india, state  forest  departments  and  the  ministry  of  environment. We  all  work  together  on  stuff.
So  it  seemed  that  the  toxin  that  was  killing  the  gharial  was  something  in  the  food  chain, something  in  the  fish, they  were  eating  
But  Poolan  devi  was  one  [of  Them], which  actually  shekhar  kapur  made  an  incredible  movie.
So  who  is  next  us, 
We've  got  a  lot  of  a  good  team  of  people  working  up  there.
So  we  can  do  it  
And  there  is  a  gharial  looking  at  us  from  the  river.
Namaste, 
I  look  at  it  as  a  creature  who  is  totally  frightened  of  something.
You  were  saying  that  that  Hasn't  been  filmed  before  
And  the  guy  who  is  working  there  with  them  He's  from  Maharashtra, he  said, i  think  He's  after  the  Nusha  
Whenever  he  eats  the  pit  viper, he  gets  this  little  venom  rush.
To  me  That’s  the  real  natural  wonder, 
And  the  insurance  companies  found  that  they  began  to  save  almost  30000  dollars  per  patient.
And  I’ll  talk  more  about  this. But  the  real  epidemic  Isn’t  just  heart  disease, or  obesity  or  smoking  --  It’s  loneliness  and  depression.
And  the  pain  is  not  the  problem  It’s: the  symptom  
What  was  the  biggest  selling  drug  of  all  time  when  it  was  introduced  a  few  years  ago?
So  the  very  behaviors  that  we  think  of  as  being  so  sexy  in  our  culture, are  the  very  ones  that  leave  so  many  people  feeling  tired, Lethargic, depressed  and  impotent  and  That’s  not  much  fun  
Your  sexual  function  improves  
When  you  eat  a  big  fatty  meal, how  do  you  feel  
You  feel  kind  of  sleepy  afterwards, 
These  are  not  election  returns. These  are  the  percentage  of  people  who  are  overweight.
He  says, I’ve  got  some  good  news  
What  we  found  was  that  after  a  year, none  of  the  experimental  group  patients  who  made  these  lifestyle  changes  needed  treatment. Whereas  six  of  the  Control-group  patients  needed  surgery  or  radiation.
And  then  i  wondered, was  there  any  relationship  between  how  much  people  changed  their  diet  and  lifestyle  --  whichever  group  they  were  in  --  and  the  changes  in  psa  
The  last  thing  i  want  to  talk  about  apropos  of  the  issue  of  the  pursuit  of  happiness  is  that  study  after  study  have  shown  that  people  who  are  lonely  and  depressed  --  and  depression  is  the  other  real  epidemic  in  our  culture  --  are  many  times  more  likely  to  get  sick  and  die  prematurely  in  part.
It  can  be  sexual  intimacy  –  i  happen  to  think  that  healing  energy  and  erotic  energy  are  just  different  forms  of  the  same  thing.
And  at  the  end  of  it, somebody  said, hey, swami  What’s  the  difference  between  wellness  and  illness  
And  so  he  went  up  on  the  board, and  he  wrote  the  word  illness  and  circled  the  first  letter, and  then  wrote  the  word  wellness  and  circled  the  first  two  letters  
And  along  the  way, they  created  a  breakthrough  in  computer  visualization  ,
Hopefully  it  Won't  Stutter  
And  if  we  did  our  jobs, well, you  Won't  know  that  we  were  even  involved  
Some  you  could  see  some  you  Couldn't  
Now, There's, no  use  of  prosthetic  makeup  or  photography  of  brad, superimposed  over  another  Actor's  body, 
Now, Fincher  is  an  interesting  guy.
And  so  david  had  an  interesting  take  on  the  film, and  he  threw  a  challenge  at  us.
We  went  through  a  process  of  elimination  and  a  process  of  discovery  with  david, and  we  ruled  out, of  course, Swapping  actors, 
But  we  used  lots  of  cheats  and  shortcuts  
We  really  felt  like  we  were  in  a  --  kind  of  a  12-step  program.
And  of  course, the  first  step  is  admit, You've  got  a  problem  
So  we  needed  a  system  that  would  allow  benjamin  to  do  everything.
And  we  realized  that  there  was  a  giant  chasm  between  the  state  of  the  art  of  technology  in  2004  and  where  we  needed  it  to  be  
The  state  of  the  art  at  the  time  was  something  called  Marker-based  motion, capture  
But  we  also  looked  at  numbers  of  other  films  at  the  time  that  were  using  facial  marker  tracking  and  That's  the  idea  of  putting  markers  on  the  human  face  and  doing  the  same  process.
We  needed  the  subtleties  of  the  skin  
We  needed  Creases  and  Dimples  and  wrinkles.
So  clearly, we  were  in  a  substantially  better  place  for  this  
We  measure  complexity  and  fidelity  of  data  in  terms  of  Polygonal  count  
This  was  the  breakthrough  
This  is  brad  doing  one  of  the  ekman, facs  poses  
We  shot  him  with  four  hd  cameras. So  We'd  get  multiple  views  of  him.
And  here  you  can  see  the  body  actor, 
We  also  had  to  create  an  eye  system.
He  was  very  popular  
There  were  no  animators  necessary  to  come  in  and  interpret  behavior  or  enhance  his  performance.
So  as  things  went  through  this  process, Fincher  would  always  say  it  Sandblasts  the  edges  off  of  the  performance.
So  it  sees  a  smile  as  a  smile.
But  we  ended  up  calling  the  entire  process  and  all  the  technology  emotion  capture, as  opposed  to  just  motion  capture  
Their  teeth  are  basically  Bashed  out  with  a  metal.
And  we  said, okay, here  is  some  seed  fund  
The  women  were  just  not  allowed  to  come  out  of  the  community  and  work  with  mainstream  society.
We  rescued  over  550  dancing  bears  
Now, the  end  product  of  that  action  is  up  on  the  board  here.
When  i  started  talking  to  richard  about  what  i  was  going  to  speak  about, i  had  recently  come  back  from  jordan, where  i  had  an  amazing  experience  with  a  camel  
The  guys  got  out, they  put  the  hood  up. They  started  working  under  the  hood. Got  it  going  again  about  a  hundred  yards.
And  they  said, ah, no  problem.
And  they  said, yeah, yeah, We'll  walk  We'll, find  some  camels.
So  We'll  need  to  be  very  careful  around  him.
When  They're  in  rut  --  They're  similar  to  seals  in  the  way  like  a  seal  has  to  open  its  nose  to  breathe  
They  use  them  to  pinpoint  sound  
The  Desert's  extremely  windy  as  well  as  being  very  cold  
But  they  use  their  tails  a  lot, especially  in  rut, 
But  on  this  particular  occasion, it  was  very  very  clear  that  as  Horny  as  Suki  was  jasmine, was  having  none  of  it  
So  I'm  going  to  show  you  another  film, 
But  before  i  do, i  just  want  to  mention  that  this  animal  truly  is  a  sort  of  the  suv  of  the  sand, the  ship  of  the  desert  It's.
And  if  this  is  a  creature  that  was  designed  by  committee, It's  certainly  been  like, no  committee  I've  ever  been  on  
So  Here's, what  Suki  would  do  in  search  of  a  mate  
I'm  ted  camel  
I'm  Smartly  designed  
A  distinguished  nose  with  Nostrils  lined  to  filter  out, sand  and  dust  and  a  Groove  that  catches  moisture  
Leathery  chest  pads  that  beat  the  heat  
I'm  able  to  lose  40  percent  of  my  weight  without  dying  
Humans  --  the  animal  --  are  pretty  lucky  creatures. Because  by  and  large, we  really  Don't  have  to  adapt  to  our  environment. We  adapt  our  environment  to  us.
But  this  creature  that  You've  just  seen  ultimately  adapts  and  keeps  adapting  and  adapting  
And  the  idea  was  to  have  me  record  some  of  my  poems, and  then  they  would  find  animators  to  animate  them.
Writing  is  not  actually  as  easy  as  that  for  me.
Poetry  just  says, a  few  things  in  different  ways.
Some  days  i  put  the  people  in  their  places  at  the  table  bend  their  legs  at  the  knees.
The  name  of  the  author  is  the  first  to  go  followed  Obediently  by  the  title. The  plot  the  heartbreaking  conclusion  the  entire  novel, which  suddenly  becomes  one. You  have  never  read.
It's  called  the  country  
And  that  to  me  was  a  bad  start  to  the  afterlife  having  to  witness  your  own  funeral  and  feel  Gratified  
If  it  has  a  subject, the  subject  is  adolescence.
Frankly, who  cares  if  annie  Oakley  was  a  crack  shot  at  15, or  if  maria  Callas  debuted  as  Tosca  at  17  
And  here  comes  a  second  follower  
Now  It's, not  a  lone  nut  It's, not  two  nuts  --  three  is  a  crowd, and  a  crowd  is  news.
I  was  listening  to  all  the  experts  and  talking  to  sort  of  a  board  of  medical  advisers.
I  wrote  the  book  on  a  treadmill, and  it  took  me  about  a  thousand  miles  to  write  the  book.
I  also  tried  to  be  the  safest  person.
Now, It's  a  little  extreme, i  admit, 
But  if  you  think  about  this, this  is  actually  --  the  Freakonomics  authors  wrote  about  this  --  that  more  people  die  on  a  per  mile  basis  from  drunk, walking  than  from  drunk, driving  
Without  the  sex  part, 
And  i  finally  have  stabilized  
And  i, of  course, Don't  have  time  to  go  into  all  of  them.
It  really  Impairs  cognition  
So  without  noise  reduction  technology, our  country  would  not  exist.
And  you  can  almost  trick  yourself  into  thinking, You're, eating  Doritos  
That's  my  greatest  hope, 
What  might  they  find  
Here's  a  replica  of  one  such  seal  
We  need  to  decipher  the  script  to  answer  that  question: :
In  fact, the  script  has  become  a  Battleground  of  sorts  between  three  different  groups  of  people.
If  you  look  at  a  map  of  india  today, You'll  see  that  most  of  the  languages  spoken  in  north  india  belong  to  the  indo-european  language  family, 
First  There's, no  Rosetta  stone  ,
And  furthermore, we  Don't  even  know  what  language  they  spoke  
And  to  make  matters  even  worse, most  of  the  text  that  we  have  are  extremely  short  
And  why  was  i  fascinated  
And  I'd  like  to  describe  some  of  the  results  that  we  have  found  
I'll  give  you  a  couple  of  seconds  
Languages  contain  patterns  
Language  on  the  other  hand  has  an  intermediate  level  of  entropy, It's, neither  too  rigid, nor  is  it  too  random  
Here's  a  graph  that  plots  the  Entropies  of  a  whole  bunch  of  sequences  
We  found  that  the  indus  script  actually  falls  within  the  range  of  the  linguistic  scripts.
Who'd  have  thought  that  deciphering  could  be  a  dangerous  profession  
So, as  the  old  saying  goes, if  it  looks  like  a  linguistic  script  and  it  acts  like  a  linguistic  script, then  perhaps  we  may  have  a  linguistic  script  on  our  hands.
So, as  an  example, Here's  a  word  
Okay, great  
So  this  is  just  like  a  crossword  puzzle, except  that  this  is  the  mother  of  all, crossword  puzzles, because  the  stakes  are  so  high  if  you  solve  it.
It  contains  seven  vertical  strokes, followed  by  this  Fish-like  sign  
And  it  turns  out  that  in  india, There's  a  long  tradition  of  names, being  based  on  Horoscopes  and  star  constellations  present  at  the  time  of  birth  
Similarly, There's  another  sequence  of  six  stars, and  that  translates  to  Aru  meen, which  is  the  old  dravidian  name  for  the  star  constellation.
So  that  was  pretty  exciting  
But  whilst  we  have  an  overwhelmingly, vivid  visual  understanding  of  space.
Now, this  story  Doesn't  start  with  vast  telescopes  or  futuristic  spacecraft, but  a  rather  more  humble  technology  --  and  in  fact, the  very  medium, which  gave  us  the  telecommunications  revolution  that  We're  all  part  of  today, the  telephone  
Thomas  watson  spent  hours  listening  to  the  strange  crackles  and  Hisses  and  chirps  and  whistles  that  his  accidental  antenna  detected.
They  turned  out  to  be  lightning  or  sources  of  electrical  power.
There  was  a  Glitch  in  their  Soundtrack  
We  do  enjoy  our  misery  in  a  certain  way.
Because  our  Egocentric  perception  --  from  the  Buddha's  point  of  view, Misperception  --  is  that  all  we  are  is  what  is  inside  our  skin  
And  everyone  here  is  unfortunately  carrying  that  habitual  perception, a  little  bit  right  
Like  even  when  You're  having  a  good  time, when  is  the  good  time  over  
I  think  the  dalai  lama  should  have  heard  that  i  wish  He'd  been  there  to  hear  that  
Everybody  has  the  wrong  idea.
The  human  being  is  almost  out  of  time.
This  is  Birhan, who  was  the  ethiopian  girl  who  launched  live  aid  in  the  1980s  15  minutes  away  from  death  when  she  was  rescued.
And  what  do  all  these  pictures  and  events  have  in  common  
What  they  have  in  common  is  what  we  see  Unlocks, what  we  Cannot  see  
What  we  see  Unlocks  the  invisible  ties  and  bonds  of  sympathy  that  bring  us  together  to  become  a  human  community, 
Go  back  200  years  when  the  slave  trade  was  under  pressure  from  william  Wilberforce  and  all  the  protesters  
They  won  public  opinion  over  a  long  period  of  time.
What  could  they  have  done  with  the  pictures  that  they  could  have  shown  if  they  were  able  to  use  the  modern  means  of  communication  to  win, People’s, hearts  and  minds  
I  was  with  nelson  mandela  a  year  ago, when  he  was  in  london, 
I  have  just  been  talking  to  the  president  of  sierra  leone.
I  met  her  in  a  field. She  was  Ragged.
We  must  then  build  a  proper  relationship  between  the  richest  and  the  poorest  countries  based  on  our  desire  that  they  are  able  to  Fend  for  themselves  with  the  investment  that  is  necessary  in  their  agriculture. So  that  africa  is  not  a  net  Importer  of  food.
Making  people  laugh  
So, please  send  me  your  ideas  about  how  to  design  a  foot  
We  have  to  first  know  what  a  foot  is  
And  i  want  you  to  help  me  do  that  in  this  next  clip, 
See  any  common  themes  principles: 
Now, it  turns  out  that  animals  can  go  anywhere  
If  you  want  to  study  how  a  foot  works  We're  going  to  have  to  simulate  those  surfaces  or  simulate  that  debris  
Without  a  foot  Here's, what  it  does  it?
That's  a  bipedal  octopus  That's  disguised  as  a  rolling  coconut  ,
Now, you  might  have  noticed  something  else  about  the  animals  when  they  were  running  over  the  rough  terrain.
Boy: Spiny, 
Do  we  really  understand  that  principle  of  tuning, the  answer  is, yes, 
But  look  at  this  animal, do  it  
And  you  probably  feel  them  if  you  grabbed  it  
These  are  all  from  different  insects  
Let's  look  at  that  ant  
You  see  what  happens  
So  to  our  blueprint, we  stick  on  some  sticky  pads  
These  are  its  feet  
It  has  a  hundred  to  a  thousand  split  ends  and  That's  the  secret, because  it  allows  intimate  contact.
Here, you  are  pulling  off  the  band-aid  
Here's, the  new  project  We're  trying  to  create  the  first  climbing  search-and-rescue  robot  --  no  suction  or  magnets  --  that  can  only  move  on  limited  kinds  of  surfaces.
And  here  it  is  coming  up  at  you  in  its  first  steps  up  a  wall  
And  That's  exactly  what  He's  done  
Thank  you  
The  first  thing  that  got  me  interested  in  the  sounds  of  these  underwater  animals  whose  world  was  so  foreign  to  me  was  evidence  from  captive  dolphins  that  captive  dolphins  could  imitate  human  sounds  
This  is  a  picture  of  a  Trainer's  whistle: a  whistle, a  trainer  will  blow  to  tell  a  dolphin  It's  done  the  right  thing  and  can  come  get  a  fish  
Many  mammals  have  to  produce  contact  calls  when  say  a  mother  and  calf  are  apart.
What  this  figure  shows  is  the  percentage  of  the  Separations  in  which  dolphins  whistle  against  the  maximum  distance.
So  when  dolphins  are  separating  by  less  than  20  meters, less  than  half  the  time, they  need  to  use  whistles, 
Most  of  the  time  they  can  just  find  each  other, just  by  swimming  around  ,
And  two  boats  when  the  second  boat  was  added, what  happened  was  that  some  of  the  dolphins  left  the  area  completely  
We  may  need  to  regulate  the  intensity  of  recreational  Boating  and  actual  whale  watching  in  order  to  prevent  these  kinds  of  problems.
This  is  a  kind  of  map.
So  You're  listening  to  the  complicated  song  produced  by  Humpbacks  here, 
And  this  orange  line  here  marks  the  typical  songs  of  east  coast, Humpbacks  
It's  loud  clear  --  you  can  hear  it  very  clearly  
But  you  can  still  hear  that  faint  call  
This  is  a  figure  from  a  textbook  on  underwater  sound.
Now  think  about  it.
Same  thing  in  the  north  atlantic  in  the  '50s  versus  2000  
So  we  have  to  be  very  concerned  about  when  the  noise  in  habitats  Degrades, the  habitat  enough  that  the  animals  either  have  to  pay  too  much  to  be  able  to  communicate, or  are  not  able  to  perform  critical  functions.
If  you  actually  Insulate  and  isolate  the  machinery  of  the  ship  from  the  hull, you  can  reduce  that  noise  by  99  percent.
What  Maersk  did  is  they  worked  ways  to  slow  down  
And  third, you  can  create  your  own  tours  --  you  can  share  them  with  friends.
Curtis  wong, thank  you.
So  microsoft  --  this  is  a  project  that  --  worldwide  telescope  is  dedicated  to  jim  gray, Who's, our  colleague  and  a  lot  of  his  work  that  he  did  is  really  what  makes  this  project  possible.
And  so  what  You've  seen  today  is  less  than  a  fraction  of  one  percent  of  what  is  in  here? And  in  the  ted  lab, we  have  a  tour  that  was  created  by  a  six-year-old  named  benjamin.
Two-thirds  of  all  students  in  special  ed, remedial  programs  are  guys  
And  We're  seeing  a  steady  increase  among  males  
They're  also  totally  out  of  sync  in  romantic  relationships, which  build  gradually  and  Subtly  
I  can  create  big  things  out  here, but  i  can  go  back  and  really  quickly  go  back  to  where  i  started  and  make  even  smaller  things  here.
But  the  neat  thing  about  it  is, i  can  add  control  points.
I  mean, this  technique  of  being  able  to  manipulate  a  mesh  here  with  multiple  control  points  is  actually  something  That's  state  of  the  art  
Don't  worry, 
What  we  Don't  agree  on  is  what  the  problem  actually  is  
I  think  none  of  these  is  the  problem  
We  want  to  go  on  with  our  daily  life, even  though  we  are  not  living  under  normal  circumstances.
In  the  end, benjamín  and  julián  decided  the  best  thing  they  could  do  was  to  organize  the  community  and  act  together.
That  devotion, we  feel  for  the  national  football  team.
We  need  men  and  women  who  love  mexico, and  who  are  willing  to  take  action  
The  battle  is  won, but  we  still  have  to  fight  it.
Juggling  three  balls  is  simple  and  normal  
Ok, then  You've  got  to  combine  them, because  then  you  have  the  whole  spatial  palette  in  front  of  you  
And  then  you  get  crazy  
Now  I'm  actually  going  to  ask  you  to  try  something  so  You've  got  to  pay  attention  complexity. If  you  spend  enough  time  doing  something  time  slows  down  or  your  skill  increases.
Things  slow  down  as  you  learn  as  you  learn  as  you  learn  
So  complexity  now, how  many  here  are  jugglers  
Ok, so  most  of  you  are  going  to  have  a  similar  reaction  to  this  
No  it  looks  like  a  mess. It  looks  like  a  mess  with  a  guy. There  Who's  got  his  hands  around  that  mess.
It's  being  able  to  do  something  that  other  people  Can't  do  or  Can't  understand  
All  right  so  That's  one  way  of  doing  it, which  is  five  balls  down.
Make  it  wider  
Make  it  narrower  
Enough  of  a  clue, so  you  get  the  pattern  right? Ok?
Pink  
So  white  ball  and  --  finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Pink  .
Finger, finger, finger, pink  or  finger, 
I  Don't  need  music  for  it  talking  about  time  in  a  moment.
Ahhh  
So  a  moment  
Ok, and  then  what  i  did  as  a  juggler  was  say, ok, what  can  i  do  to  make  that  something  that  is  dependent  on  something  else?
So  a  moment  
Are  we  ready  to  do  that?
Now  I'm  going  to  show  you  the  beginnings  of  a  piece  that  is  about  balance  in  some  ways. And  also  --  oh, actually, if  You're  bored, not  here, Here's, one  use  for  it.
Two  sticks, you  can  go  with  it.
It's  a  combination  of  that, the  beauty  of  that  the  shape  and  the  stories  that  were  involved  in  it  as  well  as  the  fact  that  they  protected  the  contents  
And  It's  going  to  change  as  i  go  through  it.
I  thought  it  [would]  kind  of  be  interesting  to  think  back  to  that  time  when  richard  got  the  whole  thing  started. Thank  you  very  much. Richard  It's  been  a  big  enjoyable  part  of  my  life  coming  here.
And  so  it  was  great  fun  in  those  days, and  some  of  those  of  you  who  are  in  the  audience  were  my  clients  
We'd  come  in  with  some  prototype  underneath  a  black  cloth  and  We'd  put  it  on  the  conference  table  and  We'd, pull  off  the  black  cloth.
That  was  a  really  good  time.
But  Something's  happened  in  the  last  18  years, since  richard  started  ted  and  That's  that  people  like  us  --  i  know  people  in  other  places  have  caught  onto  this  for  a  long  time.
And  i  think  You're  starting  to  see  that  and  It's  making  our  job  even  more  enjoyable  
And  so  in  order  to  do  that  We've  been  forming  internal  Video-production  groups  in  order  to  make  these  kind  of  experience  prototypes  that  show  just  what  we  mean  about  the  Man-machine  relationship, 
It's  kind  of  like  architects  who  show  people  in  their  houses, as  opposed  to  them  being  empty  
So  you  can  see  what  you  look  like  from  the  back, or  all  the  way  around  as  you  look  
This  is  cbs  sunday  morning  that  aired  about  two  weeks  ago, 
And  my  favorite  feature, which  is  a  flower  in  a  vase  that  Wilts  when  you  leave  in  disappointment.
The  dome  has  an  incredible  amount  of  water  that  washes  off  of  it  as  well  as  wastewater  
The  Pavilion's  design  goal  was  to  be  kind  of  quiet  and  peaceful  
It  can  dive  to  500  feet  to  where  sunlight  does  not  penetrate  and  is  equipped  with  powerful  lights.
(narrator, and  this  central  box  connects  the  whole  system  together  
And  so, by  doing  that, the  woman  that  you  saw  in  the  first  thing  --  She's, a  school  teacher  --  always  wanted  to  send  her  kids  to  college  and  She's  going  to  be  able  to  do  it.
As  in  this  cryptic  sentence, i  found  in  the  guardian  recently, the  marriage  suffered  a  Setback  in  1965  when  the  husband  was  killed  by  the  wife  
We  Can't  see  into  the  engine  room, 
Electrons  disappear  in  a  kind  of  Fuzz. And  there  is  only  energy, and  you  Can't  see  energy.
Not  only  is  she  aware  of  her  physical  Repulsiveness.
So  he  went  out  and  bought  a  plastic  frame  to  put  the  photograph  in  
So  one  of  the  interesting  things  about  invisibility  is  that  things  that  we  Can't  see, we  also  Can't  understand  
But  we  Can't  read  each  Other's  minds.
But  their  main  exercise  of  Telepathy  is  to  send  out  powerful  signals  to  the  rest  of  us  that  it  Doesn't  exist.
And  this  is  increasingly  peculiar  because  about  20  years  ago, when  they  started  Delving  into  the  genome, they  thought  it  would  probably  contain  around  100000  genes.
You  Can't  see  these  things, but  they  are  very  strange.
Because  That's  where  all  the  stuff  happens  that  makes  you  who  you  are  
This  is  fascinating: you  probably  know  some  of  you  that  cells  are  continually  renewed. You  can  see  it  in  skin.
But  every  cell  in  your  body  is  replaced  at  some  point, 
Livers  and  internal  organs  sort  of  take  a  bit  longer. A   spine  takes  several  years.
There  is  so  many  things  that  --  light  
Five  out  of  the  100  billion  galaxies  with  the  naked  eye. And  one  of  them  is  quite  difficult  to  see  unless  You've  got  very  good  eyesight.
What  the  others  are  here  for  I've, no  idea  
So  we  were  thinking, well, the  best  way  to  learn  from  them  is  to  read  all  of  these  millions  of  books  
Now, the  problem  is  There's  an  x-axis  for  that, which  is  the  practical  axis.
This  is  extremely  practical, but  not  so  awesome  
Now, again, we  kind  of  Caved  in, and  we  did  the  very  practical  approach, which  was  a  bit  less  awesome.
We  said, well, instead  of  releasing  the  full  text  We're  going  to  release  statistics  about  the  books  
It's  four  words, we  call  that  a  Four-gram  
Well, which  one  should  i  use  
As  of  about  six  months  ago, the  state  of  the  art  in  this  field  is  that  you  would, for  instance, go  up  to  the  following  psychologist  with  fabulous  hair  and  You'd  say, steve  You're  an  expert  on  the  irregular  verbs.
So  if  you  want  to  become  famous  early  on, you  should  be  an  actor  because  then  fame  starts  rising  by  the  end  of  your  20s  --  You're  still  young  It's, really  great  
One  mistake  you  should  not  do  is  become  a  mathematician, 
Here's  a  simple  way  to  do  it  
So, for  instance, here  --  this  suppression  index  is  for  5000  people  picked  in  english  books, where  There's  no  known  suppression  --  it  would  be  like  this  basically, tightly  centered  on  one  
What  you  expect  is  basically  what  you  observe  
But  much, more  importantly, the  distribution  is  much  wider  
It's  the  application  of  Massive-scale  data  collection  analysis  to  the  study  of  human  culture, 
There's  various  types  of  frustration, 
This  person  studies  all  the  Arghs  from  one  through  eight  A's  
These  all  happen  to  be  on  our  computers  on  computers  across  the  world.
And  when  that  happens, that  will  transform  the  way  we  have  to  understand  our  past  our  present  and  human  culture, 
One  of  them  is  pattern  recognition  
We  listen  to  differences, we  discount  sounds  that  remain  the  same  
Why  did  i  say  that  
Well, there  are  a  lot  of  reasons  for  this  
And  the  art  of  conversation  is  being  replaced  --  dangerously, i  think  --  by  personal  broadcasting, 
And  only  without  conscious  listening, can  these  things  happen  --  a  world  where  we  Don't  listen  to  each  other  at  all  is  a  very  scary  place.
It's  a  great  exercise  for  improving  the  quality  of  your  listening  
So  mundane  sounds  can  be  really  interesting.
You  can  use  this  in  listening  in  communication.
Why  is  it  not  taught  It's  crazy?
Thank  you  for  listening  to  me  today, 
So  what  happened  was  when  i  was  young  and  got  out  of  engineering  school  at  cornell  in  '79, i  decided  --  i  went  to  work  for  intel, and  i  was  in  the  computer  industry  --  and  three  months  into  that. I   fell  in  love  with  something  else. And  i  said, i  made  the  wrong  career  choice  here, and  i  fell  in  love  with  brains.
We  are  in  the  Pre-paradigm  days, if  you  want  to  use  thomas  Kuhn, 
And  theory  has  not  played  a  role  in  any  sort  of  grand  way  in  the  Neurosciences  
You're  more  complicated  than  your  brain  You've  got  a  brain  
That's  always  been  the  case. And  so  all  we  can  say, well, my  neocortex, which  is  the  part  of  the  brain  I'm  interested  in  has  30  billion  cells.
The  best  minds  were  Stumped  --  really, really  smart  people.
It  just  turns  out  It's  really  hard  to  think  of  things. But  once  You've  thought  of  them  It's  kind  of  easy  to  understand  it.
So  it  was  intuitive  and  obvious.
And  I'm  going  to  work  you  through  this  in  a  few  slides.
And  alan  turing  defined  the  turing  test, which  is  essentially  saying, We'll  know  if  Something's  intelligent, if  it  behaves  identical  to  a  human  ,
A  behavioral  metric  of  what  intelligence  is. And  this  has  stuck  in  our  minds  for  a  long  period  of  time.
You're  not  aware  of  this, but  your  eyes  are  always  moving  .
It's  not  always  true, but  in  general  There's, not  a  good  history  of  theory  in  biology, 
Not  like  computer, memory  It's, not  at  all  like  computer, memory  
You  Cannot  learn  or  recall  anything  outside  of  a  sequence  
If  you  Don't  build  it, you  Don't  understand  it.
The  new  brain  is  actually  kind  of  easier  than  the  old  brain.
But  ultimately, the  World's  the  limit  here, 
I  Don't  know  how  this  is  going  to  turn  out  
They  Couldn't  anticipate  cell  phones  and  the  internet  and  all  this  kind  of  stuff  
I  do  not  think  about  what  i  consider  to  be  peace, which  is  sustainable  peace  with  justice  and  equality  
But  He's  offering  84  billion  dollars  for  the  Modernizing  of  nuclear  weapons.
In  global  terms, It's  a  little  bit  of  money, 
But  It's  going  to  Modernize  weapons, we  do  not  need  and  will  not  be  gotten  rid  of  in  our  lifetime  unless  we  get  up  off  our  
I  was  in  hiroshima  a  couple  of  weeks  ago  and  his  holiness  --  We're  sitting  there  in  front  of  thousands  of  people  in  the  city. And  there  were  about  eight  of  us  nobel  laureates.
We're, staring  at  everybody, waiting  our  turn  to  speak.
I  spoke  with  Aung  sun, Suu  Kyi  a  couple  of  days  ago, 
She  said, you  know, we  have  a  long  road  to  go  to  finally  get  democracy  in  my  country.
Here's  another  woman, hero  of  mine  
She  says, the  airports  of  the  world, 
They  call  her  the  tree  lady, but  She's  more  than  the  tree  lady.
This  is  Rigoberta, Menchu, Tum, 
It's, not  a  dirty  word  
It's  hard  work  every  single  day  
And  then, when  she  closed  the  door, grandma  said, no, no, no, no  
And  they  also  when  they  want  to  travel, they  use  flying  machines  that  can  take  them  to  remote  destinations.
And  they  want  the  washing  machine.
So  how  come  [this  Is]  something  that  everyone  uses  and  they  think  others  will  not  stop  it.
And  over  there, they  Don't  even  use  one  each  
What  are  the  trends  if  we  just  Prolong  the  trends  without  any  real  advanced  analysis  to  2050? There  are  two  things  that  can  increase  the  energy  use.
And  these  22  units  --  still  the  richest  people  use  most  of  it  
They  must  change  behavior  in  some  way.
They  must  also  start  to  produce  green  energy, much  more  green  energy, 
I  was  like, okay, That's  social  skill  
You  go  to  an  elementary  school  at  three  in  the  afternoon, and  you  watch  the  kids  come  out  and  They're  wearing  these  80-pound  Backpacks  
Another  finding  is  that  the  unconscious  far  from  being  dumb  and  Sexualized  is  actually  quite  smart  
And  the  way  you  should  do  that  is  study  the  furniture, let  it  marinate  in  your  mind  distract  yourself.
Now, I'm  a  middle-aged  guy, 
They  put  them  into  a  brain  scan  machine  --  this  is  apocryphal  by  the  way, but  i  Don't  care  --  and  they  had  them  watch  a  horror  movie. And  then  they  had  them  describe  their  feelings  toward  their  wives.
They  have  trouble  relating  to  other  people.
Ninety-five  percent  of  our  professors  report  that  they  are  above-average  teachers.
They  have  Epistemological  Modesty  
They  are  open-minded  in  the  face  of  ambiguity  
The  third  trait  is  Metis  what  we  might  call  street  Smarts  --  It's, a  greek  word, 
And  that  comes  in  tremendously  handy  because  groups  are  smarter  than  individuals.
What  picasso  did, for  example  was  take  the  concept  western  art  and  the  concept  african  masks  and  blend  them  together  --  not  only  the  geometry, but  the  moral  systems  Entailed  in  them  
And  these  are  skills, again, we  Can't  count  and  measure  
Just  to  let, you  know, i  do  not  have  a  lexicographical  whistle.
But  people  think  that  my  job  is  to  let  the  good  words  make  that  difficult  left-hand  turn  into  the  dictionary  and  keep  the  bad  words  out  
And  It's  not  very  fun. And  when  parts  of  your  job  are  not  easy  or  fun, you  kind  of  look  for  an  excuse, not  to  do  them.
But  why  do  people  want  me  to  direct  traffic  when  i  would  much  rather  go  fishing  
Why  do  i  blame  the  queen  
So  He's, really  responsible  for  a  lot  of  what  we  consider  modern  in  dictionaries  today.
I  mean, I'm  a  huge  geek.
It's  Steampunk, what  we  have  is  an  electric  Velocipede  
Online  dictionaries  must  be  different  
This  is  flat, look  how  many  links  there  are  in  the  actual  entry.
So  It's  not  that  we  have  good  words.
Some  of  my  best  friends  are  books  
How  can  you  say  that  a  Sledgehammer  is  better  than  a  Ball-peen?
So  if  We're  not  worrying  about  directing  traffic, if  We've  Transcended  paper, if  we  are  worrying  less  about  control  and  more  about  description, then  we  can  think  of  the  english  language  as  being  this  beautiful  mobile  
If  only  one  out  of  every  10  of  those  books  had  a  word  That's, not  in  the  dictionary  in  it  that  would  be  equivalent  to  more  than  two  Unabridged  dictionaries.
You  know, It's  pretty  to  look  at  for  a  while, but  then  it  dies.
We  can  leave  the  aesthetic  judgments  to  the  writers, and  the  speakers  
I  was  15  when  i  was  Gang-raped  by  eight  men, 
But  the  rest  who  succumb  into  it, go  through  everyday  torture, 
These  are  men  who  buy  you  for  an  hour  for  a  day  and  use  you  throw  you  
And  we  are  silent  about  them  
But  the  extra  bonuses  that  she  gets  is  various  infections. Sexually  transmitted  infections. Hiv, aids, Syphilis, Gonorrhea. You  name  it  substance  abuse  drugs, everything  under  the  sun.
And  therefore  my  challenge  was  to  understand, how  can  i  get  out  the  power  from  this  pain?
What  has  been  my  challenge  
My  biggest  challenge  is  society: 
It's  you  and  me, 
But  it  is  not  nice  to  bring  them  to  our  homes.
So  I'm  just  going  to  grab  a  chair  here.
I  had  this  company  that  I'd  spent  15  years  building  It's  called  future. It  was  a  magazine  publishing  company.
It  had  recently  gone  public, and  the  market  said  that  it  was  apparently  worth  two  billion  dollars. A   number.
The  date  was  february  2000  
I  mean  it  had  to  right, i  was  in  for  quite  a  surprise  
I  watched  my  own  net  worth  falling  by  about  a  million  dollars  a  day  every  day  for  18  months, 
Turns  out  that  the  research  done  on  that  is  absolutely  mind-blowing  
It's, the  total  brain  experience  We're  going  to  
So  i  will  Here's  the  vision  for  ted  
This  is  a  video  prototype  
And  they  Don't  react  to  background  sounds  
And  we  were  quite  intrigued  with  playing  with  the  notion  of  invisibility  
Soren  enters  the  room  pop. He  goes  invisible.
So  people  would  walking  into  the  room  and  They'd  almost  ignore  it  thinking.
So  this  work  is  a  Caricature  of  an  upside-down.
Because  if  that  circle  Weren't  there  and  the  floor  was  very, even  it  would  start  to  wander  about  in  the  space.
That's  my  colleague, He's, let  it  go  
And  if  it  Isn't  easily  gotten  We'll, go  ahead  and  steal, it  
While  the  carbon  dioxide  vast  quantities  of  it  gigatons  goes  into  the  atmosphere, where  we  Can't  get  it  back  --  yet  --  and  where  it  is  causing  the  problems  that  We're  most  concerned  about  
They've  run  out  of  good  sites.
Babcock  &amp  Wilcox  that  make  nuclear  reactors  Here's  an  integral, fast  reactor  
Co2e  emissions  are  equivalent  emissions  of  all  the  greenhouse  gases  and  particles  that  cause  warming  and  converted  to  co2  
We  have  facilities  around  there.
And  you  have  the  uranium  mining  that  you  have  to  deal  with  
There  are  two  nations  north  korea  and  israel  that  have  nuclear  weapons  and  Don't  have  nuclear  power  at  all  
There's  plenty  of  solar  and  wind  
That's  from  real  data, 
Solving  the  World's  problems  can  be  done  if  you  really  put  your  mind  to  it  and  use  clean  renewable  energy.
And  in  the  united  states  senate, we  need  Bipartisan  support  --  only  one  or  two  votes  are  needed  --  to  move  global  warming  through  the  senate.
The  first  is  be  aware  of  the  propaganda.
And  I'm, you  know, very  much  pro  that  kind  of  stuff.
I  Campaigned  against  nuclear  weapons  in  the  '80s, and  i  continue  to  do.
Because  five  years  from  now, it  will  blow  you  away  what  We'll  actually  have  as  alternatives  to  this  horrible, disastrous  nuclear  power, 
Your  final  pitch: stewart  
Okay, so  thank  you  mark  
It's  during  our  lifetime  that  We're  going  to  take  the  earth, take  the  people  of  earth  and  transition  off  permanently  and  That's, exciting  
In  fact, i  think  it  is  a  moral  imperative  that  we  open  the  space  frontier  ,
You  know, It's  the  first  time  that  We're  going  to  have  a  chance  to  have  planetary  redundancy, a  chance  to  if  you  would  back  up  the  biosphere  ,
And  if  you  think  about  space, everything  we  hold  of  value  on  this  planet  --  metals  and  minerals  and  real  estate  and  energy  --  is  in  infinite  quantities, in  space  
And  we  knew  nothing  about  going  to  space  
We  went  from  having  literally  put  alan  Shepard  in  suborbital  flight  to  going  to  the  moon  in  eight  years. And  the  average  age  of  the  people  that  got  us.
The  shuttle  is  costing  a  billion  dollars, a  launch  
As  we  are  going  out  there  and  taking  on  a  new  frontier, we  should  be  allowed  to  risk  .
In  fact, anyone  who  says  we  Shouldn't, you  know, just  needs  to  be  put  aside  because  as  we  go  forward, in  fact, the  greatest  discoveries  we  will  ever  know. Is  ahead  of  us.
And  in  fact, the  large  corporations, the  governments  Can't  take  the  risk  
We've  got  an  altitude  call  of  368000  feet  
Today, you  can  go  and  experience  weightless  flights, 
Orbital  flights  --  we  can  take  you  to  the  space  station.
That  was  filmed  inside  our  airplane, and  so  you  can  now  do  this  
Let  me  talk  about  the  other  thing.
It  may  or  may  not  happen. But  if  you  put  up  a  prize, the  beautiful  thing  is, you  know, It's  a  very  small  maintenance  fee, and  you  pay  on  success.
My  work  is  --  It's  a  reflection  of  myself, 
We  all  seem  to  think  that, you  know, if  we  look  down  on  the  ground  There's, nothing, there  
And  we  use  the  word, nothing  
I  told  her, i  Couldn't  face  it. Because  the  way  the  teacher  was  treating  me  Ridiculing  me.
So  i  told  her  
And  walked  off, and  i  Didn't  expect  that  because  i  expected  one  of  these  
So  I'm  sitting  there  thinking, 
So  i  did  
But  i  thought, perhaps  the  ant  Won't  know, It'll  probably  move  in  
And  then  i  sat  down  and  all  the  ants  came  along  
It  became  part  of  me, 
As  you  can  see  That's  a  Pinhead  
Now  that  is  called  the  Huf  Haus  
So  I'm  thinking  mr  Huf  Isn't  going  to  be  very  happy. When  i  told  him  his  house  has  gone  to  another  into  the  atmosphere  somewhere.
So  to  cut  the  story  short, i  decided  that  i  had  to  go  back  and  do  it  
So  i  found  some  more, and  i  decided  to  sort  of  construct  it  very, very  slowly, holding  my  breath  working  between  my  heartbeat  and  making  sure  everything  is  Leveled  
I  noticed  that  the  house  was  occupied  
So  basically  I'd  completed  the  house  
So  i  Didn't  think  he  was  going  to  throw  bart  off  
And  sometimes  they  turn  into  little  Catapults  and  things  go  up  in  the  air  
But  i  would  never  do  it  to  a  living  fly  
Even  though  they  get  on  our  nerves, i  would  never  kill  an  insect  because  all  creatures, great  and  small  --  there  is  a  Hymn  that  says  that  
So  i  have  to  be  very, very  careful  
My  work  rough  estimate  sometimes  five  six  to  seven  weeks.
As  you  can  see  There's  an  aphid  fly  there  
I  remember  one  time  i  was  doing  it, and  the  window  was  open  .
And  then  she  looked  at  me, 
And  i  cut  off  a  little  flake  of  gold  
Because  i  had  to  put  the  torch  on  the  top  
The: flag: had  to  be  made  out  of  little  strands  of  gold  
It's  almost  like  doing  a  surgical  operation  to  get  this  thing  right?
And  that  was  done  with  a  particle  from  my  shirt  
My  point  is, here, people  have  a  choice  --  just  like  the  indian  lady  could  wear  her  sari  or  the  japanese  woman  could  wear  her  Kimono  
Which  is  why  i  prefer  the  richard  Wilk  analogy  of  globalizing  the  local  and  Localizing, the  global  
And  therefore  tradition  becomes  more  important, not  less  important  
We're  here, We're  part  of  a  community, sharing  out  ideas  and  discussing  them  
Art  becomes  a  very  important  part  of  our  national  identity.
We  have  done  extensive  research  to  ensure  that  arab  and  muslim  artists  and  arabs, who  are  not  muslims  --  not  all  arabs  are  muslims  by  the  way  --  but  we  make  sure  that  they  are  represented  in  this  new  institution.
For  me, it  was  a  new  discovery.
Now, visual  expression  is  just  one  form  of  culture  integration  
In  a  similar  way  we  have  created  the  doha  film  institute  
Who  are  you  playing  ?
The  doha  tribeca  film  festival  was  held  at  our  new  cultural  hub, Katara  
I  welcome  you  on  board  for  us  to  engage  and  discuss  new  ideas  of  how  to  bring  people  together  through  cultural  initiatives  and  discussions  
And  in  a  saying  of  the  koran, which  to  muslims  is  god  speaking  to  humanity, god  says  to  his  prophet  muhammad  --  whom  we  believe  to  be  the  last  of  a  series  of  prophets  beginning  with  adam, including  noah, including  moses, including  abraham, including  jesus  christ  and  ending  with  muhammad  --  that  we  have  not  sent  you  o  muhammad, except  as  a  'rahmah', except  as  a  source  of  compassion  to  humanity.
The  esoteric  path  of  islam  is  more  Popularly  known  as  Sufism  or  Tasawwuf  in  arabic  
The  language  differs, but  the  objective  is  the  same  
And  therefore, for  us  to  be  human  --  in  the  greatest  sense  of  what  it  means  to  be  human  in  the  most  joyful  sense  of  what  it  means  to  be  human  --  means  that  we  too  have  to  be  proper  stewards  of  the  breath  of  divinity  within  us  and  seek  to  perfect  within  ourselves, the  attribute  of  being  of  being  alive  of  Beingness, the  attribute  of  wisdom  of  consciousness  of  awareness  and  the  attribute  of  being  compassionate  and  loving  beings  
And  i  believe  personally  that  We're  on  the  verge  and  that  with  the  presence  and  help  of  people  like  you  here  we  can  bring  about  the  prophecy  of  isaiah  
My  story  actually  began  when  i  was  four  years  old  and  my  family  moved  to  a  new  neighborhood  in  our  hometown  of  savannah, georgia, 
That's  why  they  were  called  ape  hangers.
And  one  afternoon, i  got  a  call  from  my  doctor  
The  next  day  i  came  to  see  him, i  was  like  doctor. That  was  a  really  good  joke.
I  believe  my  girls  will  have  plenty  of  opportunities  in  their  lives.
Linda, my  wife  Joked  that  it  was  like  having  six  different  marriage  proposals  
And  on  that  first  day, we  were  in  this  youth  Hostel  in  a  castle, 
Will  you  help  be  their  dad  
And  i  got  to  the  end  --  he  was  crying, and  i  was  crying  --  and  then  he  looked  at  me, and  he  said, yes, 
And  as  he  talked, he  had  that  Glint  in  his  eye  that  i  first  saw  back  in  holland  --  the  Glint  that  says, Let's, go  cow  tipping, even  though  we  never  did  tip  the  cow, even  though  no  one  tips  the  cow, even  though  cows  Don't  sleep, standing  up  
And  then  i  had  a  15-hour  surgery  in  which  my  surgeon  dr, john  healey, at  memorial  Sloan-kettering  hospital  in  new  york  took  out  my  left, Femur  and  replaced  it  with  titanium  .
And  anybody  who  came  to  see  me  had  to  cover  themselves  in  a  mask  and  cover  all  of  the  Extraneous  parts  of  their  body  
When  my  wife  and  i  had  kids, we  thought  it  would  be  All-hands-on-deck.
Instead  it  was  everybody  running  the  other  way.
And  there  was  something  incredibly  profound  about  sitting  down  with  my  closest  friends  and  telling  them  what  they  meant  to  me.
Now  david  is  my  literary  agent  
So  one  day, near  the  end  of  my  journey, i  said, come  on  girls.
We  set  out  on  crutches  
And  yet, for  the  four  million  years, humans  have  been  walking  upright.
As  my  physical  therapist  likes  to  say, every  step  is  a  tragedy  waiting  to  happen.
You  go  slow, you  get  where  You're  going, but  you  get  there  with  this  community, you  built  along  the  way  
So  i  stand  here  today, as  you  see  now, walking  without  crutches  or  a  cane  
And  last  week, i  had  my  18-month  scans  
And  all  the  collective  minds  in  this  room, i  dare  say, can  never  find  a  solution  for  Scan-xiety  
I  feel  that  I've  fitted  in  in  many  ways  to  some  of  the  things  that  I've  heard  
They're  fighting  to  develop  their  own  way  of  living  within  the  forest  in  a  world, That's  clean  a  world  that  Isn't  contaminated  a  world  that  Isn't  polluted  
But  of  course, my  real  field  of  expertise  lies  in  an  even  different  kind  of  civilization  --  i  Can't  really  call  it  a  civilization.
And  i  propose  to  bring  into  this  ted  conference  as  i  always  do  around  the  world, the  voice  of  the  animal  kingdom, 
The  chimps  --  There's, no  time  to  discuss  their  fascinating  lives  --  but  they  have  this  long  childhood, five  years  of  Suckling  and  sleeping  with  the  mother, and  then  another  three  four  or  five  years  of  emotional  dependence  on  her. Even  when  the  next  child  is  born.
They  can  actually  live  longer  than  60  in  captivity. So  We've  only  done  40  years  in  the  wild.
We  know  that  chimpanzees  and  some  other  creatures  can  recognize  themselves  in  mirrors  --  self, as  opposed  to  other  
They're  disappearing  for  the  reasons  that  all  of  you  in  this  room  know  only  too  well  
And  people  will  pay  more  for  Bush-meat  as  It's  called  than  for  domestic  meat  --  It's, culturally  preferred  
We  can  talk  about  the  distant  past  plan  for  the  distant  future, discuss  ideas  with  each  other, so  that  the  ideas  can  grow  from  the  accumulated  wisdom  of  a  group.
And  That's, not  just  in  the  Far-away  developing  world  That's  everywhere, 
Somebody  said  that  yesterday  
And  roots  and  shoots  is  a  program  for  hope.
See  the  brick  walls  as  all  the  problems  that  We've  inflicted  on  this  planet  
It  Isn't  something  that  their  parents  tell  them  or  their  teachers, tell  them  
That's  effective, but  if  they  decide  themselves, we  want  to  clean  this  river  and  put  the  fish  back  that  used  to  be  there.
No  violence, no  bombs.
How  many  more  minutes  two  one  
And  It's  been  so  clear  how  much  you  all  care  about  trying  to  make  this  world, a  better  place.
It's  very  encouraging  
And  We've  talked  a  lot  about  that  
And  then, as  i  went  around  the  country  after  that  and  felt  the  fear  --  the  fear  that  was  leading  to  people  feeling, they  Couldn't  worry  about  the  environment. Any  more  in  case  they  seemed  not  to  be  patriotic  --  and  i  was  trying  to  encourage  them. Somebody  came  up  with  a  little  quotation  from  mahatma  gandhi.
And  just  after  that, a  woman  brought  me  this  little  bell, and  i  want  to  end  on  this  note.
It's  in  our  hands, 
If  we  lead  lives  where  we  consciously  leave  the  lightest  possible  ecological  footprints, if  we  buy  the  things  that  are  ethical  for  us  to  buy  and  Don't  buy  the  things  that  are  not, we  can  change  the  world  overnight  
In  the  laboratory, what  we  want  to  do  is  much  the  same.
This  is  how  we  can  start  to  make  a  protocell  
As  you  know, when  you  put  oil  and  water  together, they  Don't  mix. But  through  self-assembly, we  can  get  a  nice  oil  droplet  to  form.
This  structure  then  can  organize  the  formation  of  a  membrane  boundary  around  itself.
It's  actually  quite  lifeless, once  it  forms, it  Doesn't  really  do  anything.
So  some  things  that  are  missing  is, for  example, if  you  had  a  flow  of  energy  through  a  system, what  We'd  want  is  a  protocell  that  can  harvest  some  of  that  energy  in  order  to  maintain  itself  much  like  living  systems, do  
So  i  add  some  food  source  to  the  system  
So  then  we  put  these  protocells  together  in  a  single  experiment  to  see  what  they  would  do. And  depending  on  the  conditions, we  have  some  protocells  on  the  left  that  are  moving  around, and  it  likes  to  touch  the  other  structures  in  its  environment.
So  then  i  repeated  this  experiment  a  bunch  of  times  and  one  time  something  very  interesting  happened.
So  since  we  can  make  some  interesting  protocells  that  we  like  interesting  colors  and  interesting  behaviors  and  They're  very  easy  to  make  and  they  have  interesting  lifelike  properties. Perhaps  these  protocells  have  something  to  tell  us  about  the  origin  of  life  on  the  earth. Perhaps  these  represent  an  easily  accessible  step  one  of  the  first  steps, by  which  life  got  started  on  the  early  earth.
They  look  really  good, very  nice  movement.
They're  even  better  models  of  environmental  health, because  not  only  the  same  mammalian  biology, but  they  share  your  diet, largely  .
So  they  drank  as  much  vodka  as  they  did  plain  water, which  was  interesting  
I  just  want  to  say, it  was  sort  of  a  rule  of  thumb, though, There's  about  two  or  three  fire  Hydrants  on  every  city  block, 
They  flatten  a  few  plants, no  big  deal, They'll  regenerate  
That  99  percent  of  the  time  when  a  Firetruck  is  not  parking  there, It's  Infiltrating  pollutants, 
So  these  are  small  actions  that  can  amount  to  a  significant  effect  to  improve  local  environmental  health, 
Here's, one  of  them  that  we  have  up  now  
When  a  fish  swims  underneath  a  light  goes  on  
This  is  what  it  looks  like  
So  There's  another  function  on  here, 
And  they  text  back  
In  this  case, instead  of  throwing  chewing  gum  or  Doritos  or  whatever  you  have  in  your  pocket  at  the  fish  --  There's  a  body  of  water  in  iceland  that  I've  been  dealing  with  That's  in  the  middle  of  the  city  and  the  largest  pollution  burden  on  it  is  not  the  Roadborne  pollution, It's  actually  white  bread  from  people  feeding  the  fish.
They're  Cross-species, delicious  that  is  delicious  for  humans  and  Non-humans  
And  you  say, boy, That's  a  lot  
But  you  know  what  
Now, if  you  parked  those  end  to  end  and  wrapped  them  around  the  earth  that  would  stretch  around  the  earth  125  times  
And  we  wanted  to  take  advantage  of  Moore's  law  with  electronic  controls  and  software, and  we  absolutely  wanted  our  car  to  be  connected  
So  let  me  talk  about  hydrogen.
The  beauty  of  hydrogen  is  it  can  come  from  so  many  different  sources. It  can  come  from  fossil  fuels. It  can  come  from  any  way  that  you  can  create  electricity, including  renewables.
And  hydrogen  and  fuel  cells, give  us  that  opportunity  to  actually  use  our  cars  and  trucks  when  They're  parked  to  generate  electricity  for  the  grid  
And  we  talked  about  swarm  networks  earlier  
Actually  the  theme  of  this  conference, i  think, has  hit  on  really  one  of  the  major  keys  to  pull  that  off  --  and  That's  relationships  and  working  together.
I  just  want  to  ask  one  
We're  into  this  over  a  billion  dollars  already.
In  oxford, perhaps  we  can  use  lewis  carroll. And  look  in  the  looking  glass  that  is  new  york  city  to  try  and  see  our  true  selves, or  perhaps  pass  through  to  another  world.
My  colleagues  and  i  have  been  working  for  10  years  to  rediscover  this  lost  world. In  a  project  we  call  the  Mannahatta  project.
And  I'd  like  to  tell  you  the  story  in  three  acts.
It  was  once  a  beach, and  this  painting  has  john  james  audubon, the  painter  sitting  on  the  rock  
Or  this  painting  from  the  1740s  from  greenwich  village  
Here's, bowling  green  and  Here's  broadway  
And  just  beyond  it, you  can  see  features  that  have  vanished  things  that  have  disappeared.
Or  murray  hill, and  this  is  the  Murrays'  house  on  murray  hill.
And  i  thought  to  myself, you  know, if  i  could  Georeference  this  map, if  i  could  place  this  map  in  the  grid  of  the  city  today, i  could  find  these  lost  features  of  the  city  in  the  Block-by-block  geography  that  people  know  the  geography  of  where  people  go  to  work, and  where  they  go  to  live, and  where  they  like  to  eat  
Then  if  we  added  maps  like  the  geology, the  bedrock  geology  and  the  surface, geology, what  the  glaciers  leave, if  we  make  the  soil  map  with  the  17  soil  classes  that  are  defined  by  the  national  conservation  service, if  we  make  a  digital  elevation  model  of  the  topography  that  tells  us  how  high  the  hills  were, then  we  can  calculate  the  slopes  
We  can  calculate  the  aspect  
The  white  areas  on  this  map  are  the  places  protected  from  the  winter  winds.
We  compiled  all  the  information  about  where  the  native  americans  were  the  Lenape  
And  the  old  fields, the  Successional  fields  that  go  
It  was  really  an  extraordinary  landscape  that  was  capable  of  supporting  an  extraordinary  biodiversity.
As  if  these  were  the  maps  that  we  would  need  to  predict  where  you  would  find  the  beaver  
An  aspen  needs  fire  and  dry  soils.
But  what  are  the  conditions  that  make  it  possible?
And  these  would  be  the  kind  of  trees  that  might  have  been  there  and  the  flowers  and  the  lichens  and  the  mosses, the  butterflies  the  fish  in  the  stream, the  birds  in  the  trees, 
And  perhaps  a  black  bear  walked  by  and  maybe  native  americans  were  there  
And  we  used  it  to  try  and  reveal  a  landscape  here  in  act  iii, 
We  can  see  the  fields  that  the  native  americans  made  
So  when  You're  watching  law  and  order  and  the  lawyers  walk  up  the  steps, they  could  have  walked  back  down  those  steps  of  the  new  york  court  house, right  into  the  collect  pond  400  years  ago.
And  i  think  this  is  what  We're  learning  about  building  cities  in  the  future.
This  is  the  particular  additional  habitat  requirement  of  humanity.
Fill  in  the  Blanks  
Unfortunately, while  this  society  is  without  a  doubt, the  most  prosperous  and  dynamic  the  world  has  ever  created, It's  got  some  major  major  flaws  
Clearly  we  Don't  have  10  planets.
And  they  may  not  want  to  live  exactly  like  us.
You  know, so  on  the  one  hand, we  have  the  unthinkable.
You  know, what  We're  out  there  doing  is  looking  for  examples  of  tools  models  and  ideas, which  if  widely  adopted  would  change  the  game  
Here, for  example, is  vancouver  which, if  you  Haven't  been  there, you  ought  to  go  for  a  visit  It's, a  fabulous  city, 
But  once  you  also  have  people  living  in  close  proximity  to  each  other  one  of  the  things  you  can  do  is  --  as  information  technologies  develop  --  you  can  start  to  have  smart  places.
They  live  in  the  emerging  megacities  of  the  developing  world.
All  throughout  the  developing  world, people  are  going  directly  to  cell  phones.
When  you  have  free  ability  for  people  to  freely  work  together  and  innovate, you  get  different  kinds  of  solutions.
And  those  solutions  are  accessible  in  a  different  way  to  people  who  Don't  have  capital  right.
It's  doing  something  new  There's, new  things, happening  
You  have  other  radical  examples  where  the  ability  to  use  cultural  tools  is  spreading  out  
Another  world  is  possible.
We  tweak  that  a  lot  
We're  looking  a  lot  at  this. This  is  spreading  everywhere.
This  is  from  a  force, more  powerful  It's, a  little  screenshot  
These  are  refrigerators  that  require  no  electricity  They're  pot  within  a  pot  design  
How  do  we  help  people  like  that?
Audience: it  detects  landmines, 
If  you  are  living  in  one  of  the  places  where  the  roughly  Half-billion  Unaccounted  for  mines  are  scattered, you  can  Fling  these  seeds  out  into  the  field.
And  policing  copyright  violations  for  Children's  birthday  cakes  was  such  a  hassle  that  the  college  bakery  said, you  know  what  We're  getting  out  of  that  business  
If  You're  an  amateur, you  Don't  have  access  to  our  machine  anymore.
So  the  policing  layer  around  the  problem  becomes  the  real  threat  of  the  act.
And  the  back  story  is  this  sopa  and  pipa  as  legislation  were  drafted, largely  by  media  companies  that  were  founded  in  the  20th  century, 
And  congress  did  something  
And  that  law  was  called  the  audio  home  recording  act  of  1992  
So  when  the  audio  home  recording  act  of  1992  was  passed, the  media  businesses  gave  up  on  the  idea  of  legal  versus  illegal  distinctions  for  copying. Because  it  was  clear  that  if  congress  was  acting  in  their  framework, they  might  actually  increase  the  rights  of  citizens  to  participate  in  our  own  media  environment.
It  was  a  complicated  piece  of  legislation  a  lot  of  moving  parts.
That  is  a  side  effect  of  their  ordinary  operation.
Every  dvd  player  and  game  player  and  television  and  computer, you  brought  home  --  no  matter  what  you  thought  you  were  getting  when  you  bought  it  --  could  be  broken  by  the  content  industries.
So  this  is  the  internet  they  have  in  mind  
Imagine  it  says  ted  because  the  comments  Can't  be  Policed  at  any  acceptable  cost  
And  if  You're  not  an  american  citizen, you  can  contact  american  citizens  that  you  know  and  encourage  them  to  do  the  same  
And  the  dmca  goes  back  to  the  audio  home  recording  act  which  horrified  those  industries  
They  just  want  the  sharing  to  go  away.
The  whole  world  is  laid  out  for  you.
What  the  poor  thought  was  important  would  be  reflected  in  the  college  
You  failed  in  your  exam, 
The  education  system  in  india  makes  you  look  at  paris  and  new  delhi  and  zurich. What  are  you  doing  in  this  village?
You  have  to  have  a  dignity  of  labor  
A  traditional  Midwife  is  a  professional  
And  It's  the  only  college  where  we  Don't  give  a  certificate  
So  when  i  said  that  they  said, well  show  us  what  is  possible.
The  men  should  clear  out  because  we  Don't  want  to  share  this  technology  with  the  men.
It's  the  only  college  which  is  fully  solar-electrified  
So  long  as  the  sun, shines  We'll  have  no  problem  with  power  
And  we  have  60  meals  twice  a  day  of  solar  cooking.
She  looks  after  20, goats  in  the  morning, but  She's  prime  minister  in  the  evening, 
Wasn't  Dazzled  at  all  by  what  was  happening  
Where  the  percentage  of  illiteracy  is  very  high, we  use  Puppetry  
Why  because  they  want  to  leave  the  village  and  go  to  a  city  looking  for  a  job  
Comes  back  goes  into  the  village  says, well, What's, the  story  
They  said, these  two  grandmothers  grandmothers: the  minister  Couldn't  believe  what  was  happening  
Went  straight  to  the  president  
So  he  summoned  me  and  said, can  you  train  me?
I  said, yeah, she  is  very  beautiful  
And  when  i  went  back  six  months  later, i  said, Where's  your  husband  
Don't, listen  to  the  world  bank, listen  to  the  people  on  the  ground.
Our  scientist  colleagues  are  finding  new  patterns  in  the  information.
For  artists, We're  making  new  worlds  that  we  can  uncover  and  explore  
The  white  dots  are  the  probability  wave  that  will  show  you  where  the  electron  is  in  any  given  point  of  time  and  space  in  this  particular  Three-orbital  configuration.
What  kind  of  remarkable  machinery  does  this  guy  have  in  his  head  
A  system  of  cognitive  processes, largely  Non-conscious  cognitive  processes  that  help  them  change  their  views  of  the  world, so  that  they  can  feel  better  about  the  worlds  in  which  they  find  themselves  
Who  are  these  characters  who  are  so  damn  happy?
Some  of  you  are  old  enough  to  remember, he  was  the  chairman  of  the  house  of  representatives. And  he  resigned  in  disgrace.
So  he  went  to  find  them, they  said, we  can  give  you  a  franchise  on  this  for  3000  bucks.
And  finally, never  ever  join  the  beatles  
In  this  case, because  the  experiment  I'm  going  to  tell  you  about  uses  them, these  are  monet  prints.
We  did  this  experiment  with  a  group  of  patients  who  had  Anterograde  Amnesia. These  are  Hospitalized  patients.
We  then  gave  them  the  choice  between  number  three  and  number  four  
Really  jim  you  Don't, remember, i  was  just  here  with  the  monet  prints  
Free  Aren't: you  just  giving  me  my  own  paper.
What  are  you  doing  
They  Don't  like  their  picture. And  in  fact, even  after  the  opportunity  to  swap  has  Expired, they  still  Don't  like  their  picture.
We  could  do  it  so  that  when  you  take  the  two  pictures, You'd  have  four  days  to  change  your  mind  or  We're  doing  another  course  where  you  take  the  two  pictures  and  you  make  up  your  mind  right  away, and  you  can  never  change  it, which  course, would  you  like  to  be  in  
Let  me  parenthetically  pause  here  and  tell  you  --  esther, my  mother  had  stopped  driving  several  years  ago  to  the  collective  relief  of  the  entire  city  of  atlanta.
There's, a  historical  marker  
I  guess  i  must  
Oh  jesus  
Puts  it  in  reverse  Fifty-five  out  of  the  Driveway  in  reverse  
I've  got  a  White-knuckle  grip  on  the  door, you  know  what  I'm  talking  about  
And  there  she  goes  right  
Ok, so  i  stopped  at  a  light  and  There's  a  guy, you  know, in  the  back  
Now, you  have  all  been  at  a  mall  during  the  holidays.
It  will  upset  you  
Look  the  chevy  --  He's  coming  this  way, 
How  many  of  you  once  in  your  --  you  were  a  kid, you  were  an  adult  --  you  stood  in  a  parking  space  to  hold  it  for  someone  
Of  course, her  Comeback  is, when  have  i  embarrassed?
A  brevity  brevity  of  everything  with  this  child  
But  she  pauses  occasionally  and  says, how  do  you  spell  that  what  year?
When  she  writes  the  expose  in  about  20  years, Don't, believe  a  word  of  it  
But  this  is  my  daughter  lauren: my  remarkable  daughter, my  Borderline  Asperger's  kid, 
She  says, ma, you  got  to  look  
Now, when  this  kid  says, i  got  to  look, you  know, 
Oh  jesus, oh, jesus  ,
I  finally  come  --  and  now  It's  the  south  
We  want  to  curl  up  and  say, tell  it  to  me, tell  it  to  me  
I'm  with  the  little  lady, damn  ,
After  i  say  --  let  me  Refresh  you  --  have  you  no  shame  
With  her  is  a  young  man  --  husband, brother, lover, It's, not  my  job.
They  turn  then  shoulder  to  shoulder  and  walk  away  lost  in  their  own  Reverie  
And  they  use  motors  that  literally  are  used  on  cruise  missile  Boosters  
Voices: woohoo: yeah, nice, ,
What  are  catastrophic  effects  a  three  degree  centigrade, climate  change  rise, that  will  result  in  50  percent  species, extinction  
But  now  I'll  talk  about  some  more  pleasant  things, 
How  fabulous  why  would  you  ever  want  to  go  by  yourself  in  your  own  car?
Where  can  i  go  today?
It's  when  you  charge  a  premium  for  people  to  drive  on  Congested  roads, 
In  london, the  day  they  turned  the  congestion  pricing  on  there  was  a  25  percent  decrease  in  congestion  overnight  and  That's  persisted  for  the  four  years  in  which  They've  been  doing  congestion  pricing, 
You  Weren't  going  to  put  Tollbooths  around  the  city  of  london  and  open  and  shut  those  gates  
And  road  pricing  is  where  We're  all  going  to  have  to  go. Because  today  we  pay  for  our  maintenance  and  wear  and  tear  on  our  cars  with  gas  taxes.
And  if  we  have  it  You'll  decide  how  many  miles  to  drive  what  mode  of  travel  where  to  live  and  work  
Again, all  mesh-enabled  monthly  communication  cost.
They're  resilient  their  redundancy  is  built  into  this  fabulous  decentralized, design  ,
These  things  are  going  to  happen.
Maybe  we  Shouldn't  wait  for  the  10  or  15  years  for  this  to  happen  
And  if  i  had  my  Druthers, we  would  have  an  open-source  version.
When  i  went  this  morning  to  larry  Brilliant's  tedtalk  prize  --  his  fabulous  networks  --  imagine  if  there  was  an  open-source  mesh  communications  device  that  can  be  put  into  those  networks  to  make  all  that  happen.
So  the  awesome  story, it  begins  about  40  years  ago  when  my  mom  and  my  dad  came  to  canada, 
My  dad  left, a  small  village  outside  of  Amritsar, india, 
And  they  got  here  in  the  late  1960s  
We  grew  up  taking  for  granted. A   lot  of  the  things  that  my  parents  Couldn't  take  for  granted  when  they  grew  up  --  things  like  power, always  on  in  our  houses, things  like  schools  across  the  street  and  hospitals  down  the  road  and  Popsicles  in  the  backyard.
So  you  Can't  actually  see  them, but  it  was  breathtaking  believe  me, 
My  marriage  Wasn't  going  well, and  we  just  were  growing  further  and  further  apart  
One  day, my  wife  came  home  from  work  and  summoned  the  courage  through  a  lot  of  tears  to  have  a  very  honest  conversation.
And  as  these  dark  clouds  were  circling  me, and  i  was  finding  it  really, really  difficult  to  think  of  anything  good.
And  nobody  read  it, except  for  my  mom  
Flash-forward  to  the  next  year, and  the  book  of  awesome  has  now  been  number  one  on  the  bestseller  list  for  20  straight  weeks, 
But  look, i  said, i  wanted  to  do  three  things  with  you  today.
It's, sad  and  It's, not  pleasant  to  talk  about, but  your  husband  might  leave  you  your  girlfriend  could  cheat. Your  headaches  might  be  more  serious  than  you  thought, or  your  dog  could  get  hit  by  a  car  on  the  street.
And  there  are  times  in  life  when  you  will  be  tossed  in  the  well  too  with  twists  in  your  stomach  and  with  holes  in  your  heart. And  when  that  bad  news  washes  over  you  and  when  that  pain  Sponges  and  Soaks  in  i  just  really  hope  you  feel  like  You've, always  got  two  choices.
Because  you  all  used  to  be  three  years  old  
That  three-year-old  girl  is  still  part  of  you  
These  were  four  guys  on  the  la  Rams  in  the  1960s.
I'd  like  to  pause  my  tedtalk  for  about  10  seconds  right  now, because  you  Don't  get  many  opportunities  in  life  to  do  something  like  this. And  my  parents  are  sitting  in  the  front  row.
He  would  say, look, can  you  believe  they  have  a  mango  here  from  mexico?
You  can  sleep  in  clean  sheets.
The  cashiers  at  your  grocery  store, the  foreman  at  your  plant, the  guy  Tailgating, you  home  on  the  highway, the  Telemarketer  calling  you  during  dinner  every  teacher  You've  ever  had  everyone  That's  ever  Woken  up  beside  you  every  politician, in  every  country, every  actor  in  every  movie, every  single  person  in  your  family. Everyone, you  love  everyone  in  this  room. And  you  will  be  dead  in  a  hundred  years.
Thank  you  
Dan  rather, since  the  september  11th  attack  on  the  world  trade  center, many  people  have  flocked  to  downtown  new  york  to  see  and  pay  respects  at  what  amounts  to  the  16-acre  burial  ground.
Now  as  Cbs's  jim  axelrod, reports  They're, putting  the  finishing  touches  on  a  new  way  for  people  to  visit  and  view  the  scene  
There's  a  new  place  in  new  york, where  the  crowds  are  Thickest  --  ground, zero, ,
This  is  ours  
David  rockwell, the  first  experience  people  will  have  here  when  they  see  this  is  not  as  a  construction  site, but  as  this  incredibly  moving  burial  ground, 
The  walls  are  bare  by  design. So  people  can  fill  them  with  their  own  memorials. The  way  they  already  have  along  the  current  perimeter.
Your  work  is  highly  sensual, even  Hedonistic  
But  I've  got  to  tell  you  --  it  became  impossible  to  do  that.
We  were  really  paralyzed  
And  in  discussing  this  with  other  architects, we  had  seen  people  saying  in  the  press  that  they  should  rebuild  the  towers  as  they  were  --  they  should  rebuild  them.
It  was  predominantly  a  white, rich, corporate  group  that  was  not  representative  of  the  city.
And  i  think  this  was  the  21st, and  we  knew  this  had  to  be  built  and  up  by  the  28th  
In  fact, it  was  as  if  this  was  going  to  be  Window-washing  scaffolding.
And  I've  got  to  say  that  we  spent  a  lot  of  time  in  putting  this  together, watching  the  crowds  that  gathered  at  saint  paul  --  which  is  just  to  the  right  --  and  moving  around  the  site  
No, in  fact, i  told  the  contractor  to  go  ahead  
I  think  this  is  obviously  substantially  different  from  anything  We'd  ever  thought  about  doing  before, just  by  the  nature  of  it  
Well, i  think  one  thing  that  Shouldn't  be  done  is  evaluate  --  i  think  right  now. The  discussion  is  a  very  closed  discussion  on  the  master  plan.
I  Don't  think  it  has  much  to  do  with  50  or  60  or  70  or  80  thousand  new  office  spaces, regardless  of  what  the  number  is.
And  in  fact, There's  a  proposal  on  the  table.
Right  which  the  towers  fell  into  
And  the  reason  That's  been  held  up  is  essentially  by  community  outrage, that  They're  not  Re-opening  the  street  to  connect  that  back  to  the  rest  of  the  city.
This  small  foundation, we  put  together  is  looking  for  other  ways  to  help  
So  i  thought  that  would  be  good  to  end  with  
One  of  the  tricky  issues  we  had  with  the  giuliani  administration  was  i  had  forgotten  how  Anti-graffiti  he  was  
And  essentially  our  structure  was  designed  to  be  written  on  
As  you  say, It's, not  a  memorial  
But  the  kind  of  virtually  instantaneous  nature  of  its  Erection  and  its  being  there, almost  before  you  could  believe  that  a  response  of  this  magnitude  could  be  accomplished  is  part  of  its  extraordinary  --  i  Don't  know, if  beauty  is  the  word  --  but  presence  
So  a  funny  thing  happened  on  my  way  to  becoming  a  brilliant  world-class  neuropsychologist.
Sorry, ted  
Because  this  is  what  i  do.
So  look  to  the  right-hand  side  of  the  screen  
Would  it  be  crazy  to  know, 103, gs, 
How  do  we  know  that  legislation  that  would  require  that  they  be  pulled  from  play  cleared  for  return  to  play  applies  to  them  
If  god  forbid  any  of  us  left  here  tonight  and  sustained  a  concussion, most  of  us  would  go  on  to  fully  recover  inside  of  a  couple  hours  to  a  couple  of  weeks.
Should  your  kid  play  football?
The  first  study  up  
We've, just  rolled  this  out  in  the  last  couple  months  --  Co  kids  with  brain  injury, 
Now, i  thought  that  it  was  because  i  have  this  totally  compelling  helmet. Crusade, right?
Thank  you  
This  is  but  one. This  is  frank  gehry. The  Architect's  precursor  to  the  guggenheim  in  abu  dhabi.
So  my  first  topic  with  respect  to  this  was  not  death, but  obesity  
So  this  is  a  slide  of  some  of  our  initial  results.
How  big  are  the  clusters?
This  here  shows  on  the  y-axis, the  increase  in  the  probability  that  a  person  is  obese, given  that  a  social  contact  of  theirs  is  obese  and  on  the  x-axis, the  degrees  of  separation  between  the  two  people  
And  the  next  bar  over  the  [red]  line, says, if  your  Friend's  friends  are  obese, your  risk  of  obesity  is  25  percent  higher  
There  are  at  least  three  possibilities. One  possibility  is  that  as  i  gain  weight, it  causes  you  to  gain  weight.
Another  more  subtle  possibility  is  that  they  start  gaining  weight, and  it  changes  your  ideas  of  what  an  acceptable  body  size  is  
Now, i  want  to  be  very  clear, we  do  not  think  our  work  should  or  could  justify  prejudice  against  people  of  one  or  another  body  size  at  all  
And  by  the  end, You're  going  to  see  clusters  of  obese  and  Non-obese  individuals  within  the  network, 
And  so  this  function  of  emotions  suggests  that, in  addition  to  any  other  purpose, they  serve  They're  a  kind  of  primitive  form  of  communication.
And  whether  you  become  happy  or  not  depends  in  part  on  whether  you  occupy  a  happy  patch  
So  this  work  with  emotions, which  are  so  fundamental  then  got  us  to  thinking  about  maybe  the  fundamental  causes  of  human  social  networks  are  somehow  encoded  in  our  genes.
Well, the  striking  patterns  of  human  social  networks, their  Ubiquity  and  their  apparent  purpose  beg  questions  about  whether  we  evolved  to  have  human  social  networks  in  the  first  place.
And  finally, compare  nodes  c  and  d, c  and  d, both  have  six  friends  
But  now  we  with  a  Bird's  eye  view, looking  at  this  network  can  see  that  they  occupy  very  different  social  worlds, 
So  different  structural  locations  have  different  implications  for  your  life.
They  are  a  kind  of  social  capital  
New  properties  emerge  because  of  our  Embeddedness  in  social  networks.
They're  both  made  of  carbon.
If  i  was  always  violent  towards  you  or  gave  you  Misinformation  or  made  you  sad  or  infected  you  with  deadly  germs, you  would  cut  the  ties  to  me  and  the  network  would  Disintegrate  
I'd  never  seen  anything  like  that.
But  after  seeing  what  I've  seen  the  truth  is, they  have  not  disappeared  at  all  
And  this  is  happening  every  day  
And  from  these  Bedrooms  and  living  rooms  and  garages  with  cheap  Webcams, lies  the  World's  great  dancers  of  tomorrow, 
And  you  let  it  go. And  then  right  when  you  see  the  tail, you  grab  it  by  the  tail.
You  know, you  create  power, then  you  tame, it  
According  to  the  treaty, those  lands  are  a  sovereign  nation  
1868, the  second  fort  laramie  treaty, clearly, guarantees, the  sovereignty  of  the  great  sioux  nation  and  the  Lakotas'  ownership  of  the  sacred  black  hills, 
A  new  agreement  was  presented  to  sioux  chiefs  and  their  leading  men  under  a  campaign  known  as  sell  or  starve  sign  the  paper  or  no  food  for  your  tribe.
Reservations  are  cut  up  into  160-acre  sections  and  distributed  to  individual  indians  with  the  surplus  disposed  of  
Tribes  lost  millions  of  acres  
To  this  day, this  is  the  most  medals  of  honor  ever  awarded  for  a  single  battle.
Unemployment  on  the  pine  ridge, indian  reservation  Fluctuates  between  85  and  90  percent  
This  is  how  we  came  to  own  these  united  states.
And  how  much  of  this  history  do  you  need  to  own  even  
Because  the  solution  seems  so  far  in  the  past, i  needed  nothing  short  of  a  time  machine  to  access  them.
That's, why  There's  a  glass  of  water  up  there  
This  solution  has  been  called  by  some  potentially  the  most  important  medical  advance  this  century  
And  what  it  was  was  oral  rehydration, salts  ,
Maybe  There's  a  biological  answer  
See  we  spent  a  lot  of  energy  in  many  domains  --  technological  scientific, hard, work, creativity, human  ingenuity  --  to  crack  important  social  problems  with  technology  solutions.
Here  i  have  a  bunch  of  other  examples  all  suffer  from  the  last  mile  problem.
The  last  mile  is  everywhere. Problematic.
The  problem  is  this  little  three-pound  machine  That's  behind  your  eyes  and  between  your  ears  
They  do  lots  of  inconsistent  things: 
Now, Diarrhea's  interesting  because  It's  been  around  for  thousands  of  years, ever  since  humankind  really  lived  side  by  side  enough  to  have  really  polluted  water.
So  think  of  the  mental  model  that  goes  behind  reducing  the  intake, 
So  here  you  all  are  ostensibly  educated, people  
Most  of  you  look  smart  
I  think  We've  learned  the  answer  to  that  here.
Almost  out  of  kindergarten  
These  models  like  the  Leaky  bucket  work.
They  are  situations  where  the  mental  model  Doesn't  match  the  reality  
So  now, while  You're  thinking  about  that  Let's  move  to  a  second  task  
Fifty  versus  35, That's, a  big  move.
So  far  I've  been  pretty  negative  
You  just  Gotta  carry  this  thing  around  
Here's, another  example  of  this  
This  is  from  a  company  called  positive  energy.
And  what  they  find  is  just  this  letter. Nothing  else  has  a  two  to  three  percent  reduction  in  electricity  use.
We  have  testing, we  go  to  the  lab, we  try  it  again.
So  this  whole  area  is  so  fascinating  
How  you  take  your  insights  here  and  actually  get  them  integrated  into  working  business  models  on  the  ground  in  indian  villages, for  example, 
We  work  closely  with  companies  that  have  operational  capacity  or  Nonprofits  that  have  operational  capacity.
If  you  have  biological  problems, we  try  and  fix  it.
When  the  magazine  --  actually, when  i  got  the  subscription  --  it  was  12  following  pages.
If  It's  --  see  it  for  a  long  enough  time, i  actually  do  something  about  it.
Thank  you  so  much  
Well  now, if  i  take  that  sugar, dough  the  sugar  dough  Doesn't  want  to  conduct  electricity, 
We  call  this  our  sushi  circuit  It's, very  popular  with  kids  
I  plug  in  again, the  power  to  it  
I  can  start  plugging  in  lots  of  lights  
We've  got  some  videos, you  can  make  them  yourselves.
We've  had  a  mom  in  utah, who  used  them  with  her  kids  to  a  science  researcher  in  the  uk  and  curriculum  developers  in  hawaii  
Up  Don't  move  the  wrist  over  the  heart.
And  then  look  at  me, 
Good  nice, and  you  can  sit  over  there.
Which  one  shall  have  a  good  poker  hand.
This  guy  beats  them  with  four  of  a  kind  or  Deuce  --  Deuce  
No  reaction  that  with  even  --  ok, and  this  
These  look  in  order, I'm, probably  --  hopefully  --  yeah, three.
Such  life  right  
Now  if  you  are  interested, i  will  demonstrate  some  underground  techniques.
Right  you  agree  
Ok, 
So  --  because  if  you  look  now, i  can  still  see  it  
Come  to  --  no, no, no, no  
When  I'm  sober, i  do  this  much  quicker, but  we  will  check  
Pardon, but  then  when  we  will  have  it  back, you  do  this  
Perfect  
Please  name  any  card.
My  fault  Don't  applaud.
But  now  i  do  it  the  regular  speed, right  
Excellent  
And  queen  of  hearts, yes, 
So  now, a  false  count  
Right, sorry, my  --  i  should  have  mentioned  that  yeah, 
Yeah, good  
I  liked  it.
You  see, i  Don't  work  with  prestige. So  always  do  mistakes.
One  two, three, four  --  yes, the  camera  got  it. Five, six, seven, eight  --  ah  --  nine, 10! The  jack, jack  of  spades. Queen  of  --  i  like  that  laugh. Yeah. Good. Queen.
There  was  the  place, and  here  is  king  of  spades. Correct?
Ah, this  is  tough  
Maybe  It's  important  --  yeah  --  nine  of  diamonds. Ok, .
And  i  give  you  a  diamonds, so  they  --  so  you  put  them  here  in  a  nice  row, right?
You're  Peeking, you  just  got  to  --  this  is  a  request  from  the  lady  in  the  back  
We  will  try  
And  there  are  some  of  us  who  think  you  Ain't  seen  nothing  yet  
I  see  some  of  you  recognize  this  child  
At  that  point, they  usually  give  up  
And  the  10-year-old  on  every  eight  notes  
It  can  be  the  other  Buttock  
These  are  the  people  who  never  listen  to  classical  music.
You  Couldn't  tell  the  difference  between  somebody  from  texas  and  somebody  from  rome  
Of  course, I'm  not  sure  They'll  be  up  to  it  
Do  you  know  what  i  think  probably  happened  in  this  room  
And  for  the  rest  of  your  life, every  time  you  hear  classical  music, You'll, always  be  able  to  know  if  you  hear  those  impulses  
Do  you  remember, hamlet  act, one  scene: three. He  finds  out  that  his  uncle  killed.
No  otherwise  the  play  would  be  over  stupid  
Now, he  tries  the  e  again, that  chord  Doesn't  work, 
And  I've  one  last  request  before  i  play  this  piece, all  the  way  through  
And  i  did  exactly  what  i  did  with  you, and  i  told  them  and  explained  them, and  the  whole  thing  
Now, how  would  you  walk  --  because  you  know  my  profession  the  music  profession  Doesn't, see  it  that  way  
People  in  my  orchestra  came  up  to  me  and  said, ben, what  happened  That's: what  happened?
Who  am  i  being  that?
I  learned  this  from  a  woman  who  survived  auschwitz  one  of  the  rare  survivors, 
And  she  told  me  this, she  said, we  were  in  the  train  going  to  auschwitz, and  i  looked  down  and  saw  my  Brother's  shoes  were  missing  
Thank  you  
Here's  what  he  did  he  gathered  his  participants  
If  You're  the  fastest  of  everyone  We're  testing  here  today, you  get  20  dollars.
But  for  a  lot  of  tasks, they  actually  either  Don't  work, or  often  they  do  harm  
If  you  look  at  the  science, there  is  a  mismatch  between  what  science  knows  and  what  business  does  
But  for  21st  century  tasks  that  mechanistic  Reward-and-punishment  approach  Doesn't  work  often  Doesn't  work  and  often  does  harm  
Same  deal: you  We're  timing  for  norms, 
Low-cost  providers  around  the  world  can  do  it  cheaper?
The  rules  are  Mystifying  
Okay, but  one  the  task  called  for  even  rudimentary  cognitive  skill, a  larger  reward  led  to  poorer  performance, 
People  offered  the  medium  level  of  rewards  did  no  better  than  people  offered  the  small  rewards  
In  eight  of  the  nine  tasks  we  examined  across  three  experiments, higher  incentives  led  to  worse  performance.
Last  month, just  last  month  economists  at  Lse, looked  at  51  studies  of  Pay-for-performance  plans  inside  of  companies  
There  is  a  mismatch  between  what  science  knows  and  what  business  does  
Purpose, the  yearning  to  do  what  we  do  in  the  service  of  something  larger  than  ourselves.
Traditional  notions  of  management  are  great.
A  few  times  a  year, they  tell  their  engineers  go  for  the  next  24  hours  and  work  on  anything  you  want  as  long  as  It's, not  part  of  your  regular  job.
And  then  being  australians, everybody  has  a  beer  
That  one  day  of  intense  autonomy  has  produced  a  whole  array  of  software  fixes  that  might  never  have  existed.
They  have  autonomy  over  their  time, their  task, their  team, their  technique, 
Autonomy  mastery  and  purpose  versus  carrot  and  sticks, and  who  wins  
Three  the  secret  to  high  performance, Isn't, rewards  and  Punishments, but  that  unseen  intrinsic  drive  --  the  drive  to  do  things  for  their  own  sake.
So  this  again  is  on  the  subject  --  a  slice  from  the  equator  of  the  earth.
It  turns  once  per  day  in  synchrony  with  the  earth, 
This  would  be  grown.
So  if  we  could  roll  the  next  film, here, 
This  has  evolved  over  the  years  in  a  lot  of  different  iterations  
The  idea  of  this  air  genie  is  It's, something  that  can  just  transform  and  become  anything.
And  then  it  would  have  a  corresponding  website  that  would  show  the  Itinerary  of  this  
Um, he  was  happy.
Let's  see  somebody  else  a  great  conductor  
He's  a  nice  guy, He's, a  really  nice  guy.
It's  not  true  when  he  was  a  young  man  of  about  30, he  wrote  what  he  called  the  ten  commandments  for  Conductors  
The  first  one  was, if  you  sweat  by  the  end  of  the  concert, it  means  that  you  must  have  done  something  wrong.
Now  either  he  is  Senile  and  Doesn't, remember  his  own  music, because  he  wrote  the  music  
So  no, he  Doesn't  want  that  That's  a  different  kind  of  control.
Once  like  a  muti  and  You'll  --  --  clap, just  once  
And  then  like  karajan, Let's  see  what  happens.
And  when  karajan  is  asked  about  it, he  actually  says, yes, the  worst  damage  i  can  do  to  my  orchestra  is  to  give  them  a  clear  instruction  ,
Well, it  is  different.
Look  at  the  eyes, 
And  You're  playing  a  painful  sound, 
Now, It's, a  reversed  thing, You're  telling  the  story  and  You're  telling  the  story  
But  all  my  work  for  many  years  was  focused  around  the  idea  that  sustainability  means  basically  looking  at  the  globalized, economic  growth  model  and  Moderating.
If  you  could  help  me  with  that, it  would  be  fantastic  
It's, open  source  It's, something  which  everybody  Who's  involved  with  it  develops  and  passes  on  as  they  work  with  it.
It's  self-organizing, there  is  no  great  central  organization  that  pushes  this  people  just  pick  up  an  idea, and  they  run  with  it, and  they  implement  it  where  they  are  
And  It's  really  about  how  systems  settlements  withstand  shock  from  the  outside  
When  our  supermarkets  have  only  two  or  three  Days'  worth  of  food  in  them  at  any  one  time, often, sustainability  tends  to  focus  on  the  energy  efficiency  of  the  Freezers.
It's  a  process, which  is  playful  and  creative  and  informative  
And  there  are  thousands  of  others  who  are  at  what  we  call  the  Mulling  stage  
A  lot  of  places  are  working  with  their  local  schools.
And  also  starting  to  play  around  with  the  idea  of  alternative  currencies.
And  we  see  it  all  over  the  place  as  well  now, 
This  is  probably  the  most  boring  topic  of  the  whole  morning  
Many  of  the  people  involved  have  special  interests  or  short-term  interests  that  get  them  not  thinking  about  what  the  implications  of  the  trends  are  
Now, how  did  we  get  here?
They  make  you  pay  more  in  Withholding, just  to  help  their  cash  flow  out.
And  California's  not  unique  
There's  ways  if  It's  temporary  to  minimize  the  impact, but  It's  a  problem  
Well, you  have  to  allocate  dollars  for  that  system, and  for  that  incentive, pay  
Well, there  really  is  no  brain  trust.
So  what  do  we  need  to  do  
Whenever  they  say  There's  these  long-term  problems, we  Can't  say, oh  You're, the  messenger  with  bad  news  
Now, i  think  this  is  a  solvable  problem.
What  do  i  know  that  would  cause  me  a  reticent  Midwestern  scientist  to  get  myself  arrested  in  front  of  the  white  house, protesting  
Did  it  mean  that  venus  had  an  Ionosphere  
And  it  was  kept  hot  by  a  thick  carbon  dioxide  atmosphere, 
Its  changes  will  affect  all  of  humanity.
British  physicist, john  Tyndall, in  the  1850's  made  laboratory  measurements  of  the  infrared  radiation, which  is  heat  
Most  of  the  things  mentioned  in  our  1981  paper  were  facts.
I  had  the  privilege  to  speak  twice  to  the  President's  climate  task  force.
Let  me  describe  the  most  important  conclusion  from  the  physics  --  first  from  Earth's  energy, balance  and  second  from  Earth's  climate  history, 
Now, finally, we  can  measure  Earth's  energy  imbalance  precisely  by  measuring  the  heat  content  in  Earth's  heat  reservoirs  
The  biggest  reservoir, the  ocean  was  the  least  well  measured  until  more  than  3000  Argo  floats  were  distributed  around  the  World's  ocean  
Yet  there  was  more  energy  coming  in  than  going  out  
These  curves  for  global  temperature, atmospheric  co2  and  sea  level  were  derived  from  ocean  cores  and  antarctic  ice  cores  from  ocean  sediments  and  snowflakes  that  piled  up  year  after  year  over  800000  years, forming  a  Two-mile  thick  ice  sheet, 
And  more  co2  causes  more  warming, 
So  co2  methane  and  ice  sheets  were  feedbacks  that  amplified, global  temperature, change  causing  these  ancient  climate  Oscillations  to  be  huge, even  though  the  climate  change  was  initiated  by  a  very  weak, forcing  
And  the  rate  has  accelerated  since  the  measurements  began  nine  years  ago.
Ice  sheets  would  continue  to  Disintegrate  for  centuries.
What  may  be  more  Reprehensible, if  climate  denial  continues  is  Extermination  of  species, 
An  important  impact, if  global  warming  continues  will  be  on  the  Breadbasket  of  our  nation  and  the  world, the  midwest  and  great  plains, which  are  expected  to  become  prone  to  extreme  droughts  worse  than  the  dust  bowl  within  just  a  few  decades.
I  need  your  help  to  communicate  the  gravity.
A  parachute  jump  from  the  very  edge  of  space  
What  I'd  like  to  do  first  is  take  you  through  a  very  brief  helicopter  ride  of  stunts. And  the  stunts  industry  in  the  movies  and  in  television  and  show  you  how  technology  has  started  to  interface  with  the  physical  skills  of  the  stunt  performer, in  a  way  that  makes  the  stunts  bigger  and  actually  makes  them  safer  than  They've  ever  been  before.
I'm  a  stunt  Coordinator  and  as  well  as  perform  stunts, i  often  design  them  
What  safety  they  had  was  very  Scant  
This  is  the  first  stunt  woman: rosie  Venger, an  amazing  woman, 
Yakima  Canutt  really  formed  the  stunt  fight  
Talking  of  dangerous  stunts  and  bringing  things  slightly  up  to  date. Some  of  the  most  dangerous  stunts  we  do  as  stunt  people  are  fire  stunts.
Well, we  used  to  use  Trampettes  in  the  old  days.
And  That's  a  ramp  spring  off  the  thing  and  fly  through  the  air, and  hopefully  you  make  it  look.
Now, We've  got  technology.
Rolling  a  car  over  is  another  area  where  we  use  technology  
That's  a  long  way  to  fall.
This  is  a  shot  of  terminator.
It's, 30  feet  It's, water  It's, very  simple  
This  guy  is  not  skydiving.
It's  that  shape  because  the  helium  has  to  expand  
Certainly  at  100000  feet, no  aircraft  will  fly  .
We  will  have  two  balloons  for  each  of  my  test  jumps  and  two  balloons  for  the  main  jump, because  they  notoriously  tear  on  Takeoff  
A  Drogue  chute  is  just  a  smaller  chute, which  helps  to  keep  your  face  down.
It's  hundreds  of  feet  high  It's, enormous  ,
It's, a  three  Sided  box, basically, 
That's, the  prototype  of  the  parachute  I've  now  had  them  custom, make  one  the  only  one  of  its  kind  in  the  world  and  That's  the  only  suit  of  its  kind  in  the  world.
Then  They're  comfortable, they  have  good  vision, like  this  great  big, Visor  
And  then, if  the  cabin  Depressurizes  while  the  aircraft  is  coming  back  down  in  whatever  emergency  measures, everyone  is  okay.
But  if  you  are  and  you  say  to  somebody, you  know, they  say, what  do  you  do?
Like  religion  and  money  and  other  things  
What  you  have  there  is  a  person  of  extraordinary  dedication  who  found  a  talent. And  my  contention  is  all  kids  have  tremendous  talents.
Thank  you  very  much.
And  the  girl  said, I'm  drawing  a  picture  of  god  
He  was  in  the  Nativity  play  
You  may  have  seen  it  Nativity  ii, but  james  got  the  part  of  joseph, which  we  were  thrilled  about  
We  had  the  place  crammed  full  of  agents  in  t-shirts.
Anyway, the  three  boys  came  in  --  four-year-olds  with  tea  towels  on  their  heads  --  and  they  put  these  boxes  down.
And  the  third  boy  said, frank  sent  this  
They  have  become  frightened  of  being  wrong.
So, why  is  this  
You  Don't  think  of  shakespeare, having  a  father  do  you  
Shakespeare  being  seven, i  never  thought  of  it. I   mean, he  was  seven  at  some  point. He  was  in  Somebody's  english  class  Wasn't.
And  stop  speaking  like  that  It's  confusing.
Art  and  music  are  normally  given  a  higher  status  in  schools  than  drama  and  dance. There  Isn't  an  education  system  on  the  planet  that  teaches  dance  everyday  to  children  the  way  we  teach  them  mathematics.
We  all  have  bodies  Don't, we  did.
And  i  like  university  professors, but  you  know, we  Shouldn't  hold  them  up  as  the  High-water.
Benign  advice  --  now  profoundly  mistaken. The  whole  world  is  engulfed  in  a  revolution.
Secondly, intelligence  is  dynamic  
It's  really  prompted  by  a  conversation. I   had  with  a  wonderful  woman  who  maybe  most  people  have  never  heard  of  She's  called  gillian  Lynne  --  have  you  heard  of  her? Some  have  She's  a  choreographer, and  everybody  knows  her  work.
I  grew  up  at  a  time  when  iconic  actors  from  kuwait  syria, egypt  used  laughter  to  unite  the  region, just  as  football  can  
Also  three  guys  working  for  years  in  los  angeles, an  iranian  a  palestinian  and  an  egyptian  created  the  Aptly  named  axis  of  evil.
Who  had  started  a  successful  new  tribe, 
I  invited  our  new  ceo. And  as  soon  as  he  realized, we  had  a  room  packed  full  of  laughing  Infidels. His  reaction  was  very  simple  Let's  make  this  happen.
Stay  away  from  bolitics  in  the  middle  east  
Now  were  the  axis  successful  
Anywhere  you  go  
We're, not  all  angry, Fanatics  who  want  to  kill  the  Infidel  
For  inspiration  go  to  one  of  our  festivals, go  online  drop  us, a  line, 
As  my  father  likes  to  call  him  Asheikh  Azubare  as  my  mother  would  say, shakespeare  
And  I'm, not  a  trained  academic  
It  was  very  difficult, not  to  get  scared, not  to  get  Daunted  
We  want  to  take  one  child  at  a  time  and  take  the  child  right  through  school, sent  to  college  and  get  them  prepared  for  better  living  a  high  value  job.
That  was  our  first  school.
But  they  know  there  is  this  myth  that  children  from  the  slums, Cannot, speak  english.
Even  if  it  takes  me  four  and  a  half  hours  or  three  and  half  hours  to  finish  my  book, i  do  it  
We  have  to  send  the  fathers  to  De-addiction  labs, and  when  they  come  back  most  times  sober, we  have  to  find  a  job  for  them, so  that  they  Don't  Regress  
Art, music  are  considered  therapy  and  mediums  of  expression.
We  Didn't  hire  mckinsey  to  do  a  business  plan.
He  comes  for  a  Tummy  rub  because  he  believes  that  will  give  me  luck.
I  promise  you  parusharam  will  speak  in  the  ted  conference, a  few  years  from  now  
I  think  i  was  supposed  to  talk  about  my  new  book, which  is  called  blink  and  It's  about  snap  judgments  and  first  impressions  
So  i  decided, instead, i  would  talk  about  someone  who  i  think  has  done  as  much  to  make  americans  happy  as  perhaps  anyone  over  the  last  20  years, a  man, who  is  a  great  personal  hero  of  mine.
And  one  of  his  first  clients  was  --  this  is  many  years  ago, back  in  the  early  '70s  --  one  of  his  first  clients  was  pepsi.
We'd, like  you  to  figure  out  how  much  Aspartame  we  should  put  in  each  can  of  diet  pepsi  in  order  to  have  the  perfect  drink  right?
And  he  would  think  it  through  and  say, what  was  wrong?
Why  could  we  not  make  sense  of  this  experiment  with  diet  pepsi?
This  was  his  horseradish, he  was  obsessed  with  it.
You'd  have  a  plate  of  spaghetti, and  you  would  pour  it  on  right.
And  of  those  three  facts.
And  prego  turned  to  howard, and  they  said, you  telling  me  that  one  third  of  americans  crave  extra-chunky  spaghetti  sauce. And  yet, no  one  is  Servicing  their  needs.
It's  a  mystery  
What  percentage  of  you  actually  like  a  dark, rich, hearty  roast  ,
A  mustard  of  more  sophistication  and  culture  and  meaning  
There  is  no  perfect  mustard  or  imperfect  mustard  
And  where  did  that  come  from?
When  we  talked  about  authentic  tomato  sauce  in  the  1970s, we  talked  about  italian  tomato  sauce. We  talked  about  the  earliest  Ragus, which  had  no  visible  solids, right? .
Because  we  thought  that  what  it  took  to  make  people  happy  was  to  provide  them  with  the  most  culturally  authentic  tomato  sauce, a  and  b. We  thought  that  if  we  gave  them  the  culturally  authentic  tomato  sauce, then  they  would  embrace  it.
I  guess  my  cancer  different  from  your  cancer  
And  for  that, we  owe  him  a  great  vote  of.
And  the  example, he  used  was  coffee  
But  to  us, he  was  just  dad  and  our  home  life  was  pretty  normal  
And  i  think  a  lot  of  people  in  his  day  probably  thought  he  was  a  bit  of  a  Kook  
Or  even  the  people  who  actually  pulled  it  off  the  people  at  bolt  Beranek  and  newman  in  boston, who  just  would  sketch  out  these  structures  of  what  would  eventually  become  a  worldwide  network  and  sketching  things  on  the  back  of  napkins  and  on  note  papers  and  arguing  over  dinner  at  howard  Johnson's  --  on  route, 128  in  lexington, massachusetts, just  two  miles  from  where  i  was  studying  the  Queen's  Gambit  Deferred  and  listening  to  Gladys  knight, &amp  the  Pips  singing  midnight  train  to  georgia  while  --  --  in  my  Dad's, big  easy  chair.
Another  one  which  believes  in  the  pure  transparency  of  content, 
These  are  four  very  different  ways  of  looking  at  the  world. I   even  gave  them  names.
And  There's  also  a  balance  between  the  visible  and  the  invisible  in  comics, 
This  was  even  before  the  web  
And  so  what  they  would  do  is  They'd  have  these  comic  pages  that  resemble  print  comics  pages, and  they  would  introduce  all  this  sound  and  motion  
The  distance  from  abraham  lincoln  to  a  lincoln  penny, the  penny  marshall  to  the  marshall  plan  to  plan  9  to  nine  lives.
So  i  had  all  these  notions. This  was  back  in  the  late  '90s  and  other  people  in  my  business  thought, i  was  pretty  crazy.
I  just  want  to  get  to  the  last  panel  
Talk  about  your  infinite  canvas: 
Why  is  this  important  
But  media  provides  us  with  a  window  back  into  the  world  that  we  live  in

And  as  great  as  these  books  were, you  could  always  tell  that  you  were  getting  close  to  the  full  effect.
And  That's  when  i  discovered  comedy  
It  takes  the  base  metal  of  our  conventional  wisdom  and  transforms  it  through  ridicule  into  a  different  way  of  seeing  and  ultimately  being  in  the  world.
Because  That's  what  i  take  from  the  theme  of  this  conference  gained  in  translation  
Now, I'm  big  on  speaking  to  People's  self-interest  because  We're  all  wired  for  that  
Now, That's, honesty  and  integrity  and  It's  also  why  Fey's  performances  left  such  a  lasting  impression.
Now, whether  this  says  more  about  the  conflict  between  integrity  and  Profitability  of  corporate  journalism  than  it  does  about  the  attentiveness  of  Stewart's  viewers  the  larger  point  remains  that  Stewart's  material  is  always  grounded  in  a  commitment  to  the  facts  --  not  because  his  intent  is  to  inform  It's, not  
His  intent  is  to  be  funny  
And  just  like  that  You've  been  seduced  into  a  different  way  of  looking  at  something  because  the  endorphins  have  brought  down  your  defenses  
Because  from  what  i  can  tell  the  three  things  gay  americans  seem  to  want, most  are  to  join  the  military, get  married  and  start  a  family  
Economy  of  language  is  another  real  strong  suit  of  great  comedy  
How  about  that?
And  not  long  after  that, he  got  another  request  for  a  copy  from  the  head  of  the  epa  in  california  who  used  it  as  part  of  her  presentation  at  an  international  conference  on  climate  change.
And  i  think  that  if  You're  not  There's, probably  something  inherently  wrong  with  the  structure  or  the  situation, You're  in  if  You're  a  designer  
Being  serious  is  hard  
Serious  design  serious  play  is  something  else.
Now, i  always  saw  design  careers  like  surreal.
And  as  you  get  older  and  more  decrepit, you  sort  of  inch  along  on  this  sort  of  depressing  long  staircase, leading  you  into  oblivion.
There's  a  paul  newman  movie  that  i  love  called  the  verdict  
This  is  the  case  there  are  no  other  cases, 
And  that  is  a  wonderful  position  to  be  in  to  create  some  serious  play.
There  was  no  format  
I  lived  and  breathed  it  in  a  way, i  Haven't  with  a  client  since  
It  enabled  me  to  really  express  myself  and  grow  
But  something  happened  to  it.
Here's, an  ad  in  the  new  york  times, somebody  did  for  a  play  called  mind  games.
I'd  never  done  this  kind  of  work  before  
This  is  symphony  space, on  90th  street  and  broadway, and  the  type  is  Interwoven  into  the  stainless  steel  and  backlit  with  fiber  optics.
And  it  was  serious  play.
They  got  into  it  --  they  took  the  job  incredibly  seriously.
But  it  became  the  end  of  the  seriousness  of  the  play, and  it  started  to  once, again, become  solemn  
And  then  i  spent  a  year  going  to  long  tedious, boring  meetings, trying  to  sell  this  logo  through  to  a  huge  corporation  to  the  point  of  tears  
Here's  the  united  states  
And  there  are  some  brilliant  linguists, mostly  russians, who  are  working  on  that  at  santa  Fe  institute  and  in  moscow. And  i  would  love  to  see  where  that  leads  .
You  may  just  know  more  about  everything  than  anyone  
It  was  a  big  idea  for  sure.
We  can  use  leds  
In  addition  to  higher  resolution  versions  of  this  display, my  father  and  i  are  working  on  a  new  Patent-pending  design  for  a  fully  volumetric  display  using  the  same  phenomenon.
And  so  you  could  see  that  as  this  disc  rotates  about  this  axis, it  will  create  a  disc  of  light  that  we  can  control  
That's, nothing  new  That's, a  propeller  clock, That's  the  Rims  that  you  can  buy  for  your  car.
Now, as  we  continue  to  tinker  with  the  oceans, more  and  more  reports  are  predicting  that  the  kinds  of  seas  that  We're  creating  will  be  conducive  to  Low-energy  type  of  animals, like  jellyfish  and  bacteria  
And  this  is  this  Voracious  predator  launching  a  sneak  attack  on  this  poor, little  Unsuspecting  jellyfish  there, a  By-the-wind  sailor  
It  reaches  up  to  almost  5000  pounds  --  on  a  diet  of  jellyfish, primarily, 
They  like  to  Sunbathe  Can't, blame  them  
You  know, you  look  at  sharks  and  They're, Streamlined  and  They're, sleek, and  you  look  at  tuna  and  They're  like  Torpedoes  --  they  just  give  away  their  agenda  They're  about  migration  and  strength.
And  this  is  just  so  elegantly  mysterious, It's, just  --  it  really  kind  of  holds  its  cards.
And  from  that  little  egg, they  pass  through  this  spiky  little  Porcupine  fish, stage  reminiscent  of  their  ancestry  and  develop  --  this  is  their  little  adolescent  stage  
That's  a  little  diver  up  there  in  the  corner  
How  do  you  do  that  with  an  animal  --  very  few  places  in  the  world?
And  It's  pictured  right  here  that  little  tag  up  there, 
But  they  have  40  Genera  of  parasites. And  so  we  figured  just  one  more  parasite  Won't  be  too  much  of  a  problem.
So, what  are  we  trying  to  find  out  We're  focusing  on  the  pacific  
We're  tagging  on  the  california  coast  and  We're  tagging  over  in  taiwan  and  japan  
Not  this  time  of  year  --  It's  more  around, october  ,
And  I'm  not  exaggerating.
And  They'll  put  their  fins  out  and  their  eyes  go  in  the  back  of  their  head  and  the  fish  come  up, and  they  just  clean  clean  clean  --  because  the  molas, you  know, There's  just  a  Smorgasbord  of  parasites  
I'm  going  to  show  you  our  latest  dataset  
And  we  found  that  they  kind  of  are  Homebodies  
So  That's  a  very  important  piece  of  data  
But  also  What's  important  is  that  They're  not  slacker  lazy, fish, 
I  set  up  a  website, because  i  was  getting  so  many  questions  about  molas  and  sunfish  
I  was  getting  reports  from  catholic  nuns, jewish  rabbis, muslims, christians  --  everybody  writing  in  united  by  their  love  of  life.
One  day, a  one-eyed  monkey  came  into  the  forest  
Under  a  tree, she  saw  a  woman  meditating  furiously  
She  was  the  wife  of  an  even  more  famous  brahmin.
In  india, only  25  percent  of  Rapes  come  to  a  police  station  and  of  these  25  percent  that  come  to  a  police  station. Convictions  are  only  in  four  percent  of  the  cases.
Because  nobody  can  get  a  kickback  
Man, and  you  you  count  that  she  does  it  right?
Woman  here  father, your  Eight-times, folded  cotton, sari  
It's  that  little  gene, It's  small  and  It's  mean, 
Cause  You're  either  a  victim  or  on  top, like  me, 
Goodbye, martin  luther  king  
There  are  more  people  dying  of  simple  things: 
But  the  princess  continued  whistling  
Soon  the  palace  filled  with  princes, whistling  
Now, what  shall  we  do  said  the  queen  
The  other  sort  of  genesis  of  what  von  neumann  did  was  the  difficulty  of  how  you  would  predict  the  weather  
Rca  started  this  whole  thing  off  and  said, you  know, televisions  are  the  future, not  computers  
That's  where  i  grew  up  as  a  kid, 
All  these  forces  came  together  there  in  princeton  
They  Didn't  fit  in  at  the  institute.
And  what  they  did  at  the  institute  was  publish  every  step  of  the  way, 
All  the  computers  now  are  copies  of  that  machine.
What's  code, What's  hardware, 
Damn  it, i  can  be  just  as  stubborn  as  this  thing.
Everything  up  to  this  point  is  wasted  time.
So  they  really  were  working  under  tough  conditions.
Machine  run, fine  code, Isn't  
And  sometimes  things  are  okay, 
He's, still  ahead  of  some  of  the  stuff  That's  being  done  now  
And  he  found  all  these  sort  of  --  it  was  like  a  naturalist  coming  in  and  looking  at  this  tiny  5000-byte  universe  and  seeing  all  these  things  happening  that  we  see  in  the  outside  world  in  biology, 
And  they  did  start  to  evolve  
And  It's, julian  bigelow, who  was  running  it.
Aunties  uncles, you  can  continue  to  put  your  hands  up, Aunties  and  uncles  as  well  
We  the  adults  of  the  last  four  generations  have  blessed  our  children  with  the  destiny  of  a  shorter  lifespan  than  their  own  parents  
You  lot  You're, all  right, but  We'll  get  you  eventually  Don't  worry, 
We  spend  our  lives  being  paranoid  about  death  murder  homicide. You  name, it  It's  on  the  front  page  of  every  paper.
Think  about  smoking  
And  Let's  be  honest  guys.
But  you  know  what  her  father  who  was  obese  died  in  her  arms. And  then  the  second  most  important  man  in  her  life, her  uncle  died  of  obesity.
And  He's  fed  up  with  it.
Can't  even  get  them  out  the  door  --  and  I'm  being  serious  --  Can't, even  get  them  there.
They  want  to  be  self  --  they  want  to  Self-police  themselves.
Normal  Let's  get  on  schools, something  that  I'm  fairly  much  a  specialist  in  
What  is  school  who  invented  it?
So  you  could  say  that  school  food  is  quite  important, really  judging  the  circumstances: 
The  system  is  highly  run  by  accountants  There's, not  enough  or  any  Food-knowledgeable  people  in  the  business.
We  Don't  teach  kids  about  food  right?
And  this  is  a  little  clip  from  an  elementary  school, which  is  very  common  in  england, 
I  want  to  tell  you  about  something  i  want  to  tell  you  about  something  that  kind  of  Epitomizes  the  trouble  that  We're  in  guys.
I  want  to  talk  about  something  so  basic  as  milk  
Because  someone  at  the  milk  board  right  --  and  Don't  get  me  wrong. I   support  milk  --  but  someone  at  the  milk  board, probably  paid  a  lot  of  money  for  some  Geezer  to  work  out  that  if  you  put  loads  of  Flavorings  and  colorings  and  sugar  in  milk, right  more  kids  will  drink  it.
It's  in  everything, even  the  milk, Hasn't, escaped  the  kind  of  modern-day  problems, 
There's, our  milk  There's, our  carton  
And  I've  taken  the  liberty  of  putting  in  just  the  five  years  of  elementary  school  sugar, just  from  milk, 
Now  if  i  came  up  here, and  i  wish  i  could  come  up  here  today  and  hang  a  cure  for  aids  or  cancer  You'd, be  fighting  and  scrambling  to  get  to  me  
To  reboot  and  make  real  tangible  change, real  change. So  that  i  could  look  you  in  the  white  of  the  eyes  and  say, in  10  years  time, the  history  of  your  Children's  lives, happiness  --  and  Let's, not  forget  You're  clever. If  you  eat. Well, you  know, You're  going  to  live  longer  --  all  of  that  stuff. It  will  look  different. Ok?
Now  also  back  to  the  sort  of  big  brands. Labeling.
The  workplace, we  Haven't  really  talked  about  it.
You  know, It's, local, cooks, teaching  local  people  
Around  america, if  we  just  look  back  now, there  is  plenty  of  wonderful  things  going  on  
When  i  was  in  huntington, trying  to  get  a  few  things  to  work  when  they  Weren't, i  thought, if  i  had  a  magic  wand, what  would  i  do?
I'd  just  love  to  be  put  in  front  of  some  of  the  most  amazing  Movers  and  Shakers  in  america, 
We  are  anonymous.
We  are  but  the  base  of  chaos.
And  They're, pretty  scary  
You  never  know  when  They're  going  to  attack  next  who, or  what  the  consequences  will  be  
There's  a  strong  Whiff  of  Half-baked  Anarchism  about  them  
But  one  thing  is  true: we  are  at  the  beginning  of  a  mighty  struggle  for  control  of  the  internet.
Now, this  is  a  very  complicated  struggle.
Instead  we  prefer  these  really  dazzling  technological  solutions, which  cost  a  huge  amount  of  money.
But  because  They're  a  Un  operation, maybe  That's, why  governments  and  corporations  are  not  that  interested  in  them  
Because  It's  a  Un  operation, of  course, it  lacks  funding  
Cybercriminals  would  go  there  to  buy  and  sell  stolen  credit  card  details  to  exchange  information  about  new  Malware  that  was  out  there.
The  purchaser  would  send  the  administrative  officer  some  dollars  digitally, and  the  vendor  would  sell  the  stolen  credit  card  details.
Now, i  spoke  to  one  of  these  Carders  who  We'll  call  Redbrigade  --  although  that  Wasn't  even  his  proper  nickname  --  but  i  promised  i  Wouldn't  reveal  who  he  was  
And  this  man  with  a  Planetary-sized  brain  is  now  serving  a  13-year  sentence  in  california.
And  he  has  done  Path-breaking  work  on  autism. And  confirmed  also  for  the  authorities  here  that  gary  Mckinnon  --  who  is  wanted  by  the  united  states  for  hacking  into  the  pentagon  --  suffers  from  Asperger's  and  a  secondary  condition  of  depression.
How  would  someone  get  over  that  kind  of  fear  that  the  hacker?
I  think  to  an  extent  you  have  to  understand  that  It's  Axiomatic  among  hackers  that  they  do  that  
Has  about  one-third  the  carbon  footprint  of  the  average  suburban  dweller, mostly  because  Suburbanites  drive  a  lot  more  and  living  in  detached  buildings, you  have  that  much  more  exterior  surface  to  leak  energy  out  of  
Whether  you  love  Suburbia's  leafy  privacy  or  you  hate  its  Soulless  commercial  strips, there  are  reasons  why  It's  important  to  retrofit  
But  is  it  practical  ?
June  Williamson, and  i  have  been  researching  this  topic  for  over  a  decade  and  We've  found  over  80  varied  projects  
That  basically  the  boomers  want  to  be  able  to  age  in  place  and  gen  y  would  like  to  live  an  urban  lifestyle, but  most  of  their  jobs  will  continue  to  be  out  in  suburbia  .
Other  malls  have  been  Re-inhabited  as  nursing  homes  as  universities, and  as  all  variety  of  office  space, 
We  also  found  a  lot  of  examples  of  dead  Big-box  stores  that  have  been  converted  into  all  sorts  of  Community-serving  uses  as  well  --  lots  of  schools, lots  of  churches  and  lots  of  libraries  like  this  one  
This  one  is  a  little  L-shaped  strip  shopping  center  in  phoenix, arizona  
Really  all  they  did  was  they  gave  it  a  fresh  coat  of  bright  paint, a  gourmet  grocery, and  they  put  up  a  restaurant  in  the  old  post  office.
Sometimes  It's  all  at  once  
When  Metrorail  expanded  transit  into  the  suburbs  and  opened  a  station  nearby  to  this  site, the  owners  decided  to  build  a  new  parking  deck  and  then  insert  on  top  of  their  surface, lots, a  new  main  street, several  apartments  and  Condo  buildings, while  keeping  the  existing  office  buildings, 
So  Here's  what  it  looks  like  
You  can  sort  of  see  the  funky  new  Condo  buildings  in  between  the  office  buildings  and  the  public  space  and  the  new  main  street  
I  think  they  really  built  an  attractive  place  here  and  have  just  employed  All-green  construction.
But  It's  also  not  really  enough  to  just  create  pockets  of  Walkability  
So  this  is  one  that  has  been  Retrofitted  in  california  
So  There's  a  lot  of  great  things, but  I'd  love  to  see  more  corridors, getting  retrofitting  
Sometimes  re-greening  is  really  the  better  answer  
There's  also  a  Burgeoning  suburban  farming  movement  --  sort  of  victory  gardens  meets  the  internet  
Now, retrofits  are  often  accused  of  being  examples  of  Faux  downtowns  and  instant  urbanism. And  not  without  reason  you  Don't  get  much  more  phony  than  an  astroturf  town.
I  have  to  say, these  are  very  hybrid  places.
Or  maybe  It's, because  when  i  was  a  teenager  back  in  the  '50s, my  uncle  henry  --  having  Denounced  the  Ku  Klux  klan  and  been  bombed  for  his  trouble  and  had  crosses  burned  in  his  yard  living  under  death  threat  --  took  his  wife  and  children  to  massachusetts  for  safety  and  went  back  to  south  carolina  to  face  down  the  klan  alone.
Never  mind  the  fact  that  they  were  slow  to  acknowledge  they  needed  saving  
I  labored  in  that  Vineyard  for  a  quarter  century, before  making  my  way  to  a  little  kingdom  of  the  just  in  upstate  south  carolina, a  Methodist-affiliated  institution  of  higher  learning  called  wofford  college  
And  there  mr  teszler  began  all  over  again.
He  got  the  same  answer. You  bring  the  best  workers  that  you  can  find.
Do  you  have  any  other  questions?
And  into  the  slow  second  movement  marked  Adagio  Religioso. He  incorporated  the  sounds  of  birdsong  that  he  heard  outside  his  window  in  what  he  knew  would  be  his  last  spring. He  was  imagining  a  future  for  her  in  which  he  would  play.
This  defines  the  imagined  futures  of  our  fellow  hungarians  --  robicsek  teszler  and  bartok  --  as  it  does  my  own  
This  is  our  task.
Women  go  days  weeks  months  without  looking  at  it  
You're  Twisting  your  head  up, Arching, your  back  It's, exhausting  
Ok, at  first  women  were  a  little  shy, a  little  reluctant  to  talk  
Once  they  got  going, you  Couldn't  stop  them.
Vagina, vagina, vagina. It  Doesn't  matter  how  many  times  you  say  the  word? It  never  sounds  like  a  word.
I  Don't  know  that  that  would  have  been  my  life  ambition, 
But  i  want  to  talk  a  little  bit  about  happiness  and  the  relationship  to  this  whole  vagina  journey, because  it  has  been  an  extraordinary  journey  that  began  eight  years  ago.
One  woman  took  that  energy? And  she  said, i  want  to  bring  this  wave, this  energy  to  college  Campuses. And  so  she  took  the  play, and  she  said, Let's  use  the  play  and  have  performances  of  the  play  once  a  year  where  we  can  raise  money  to  stop  violence  against  women  in  local  communities, all  around  the  world.
And  this  is  a  very  heady  place.
It's  a  body  world, and  the  species  really  exists  in  the  body.
When  we  met  her  three  years  ago, we  said  what  could  v-day  do  for  you  
Now, mr  alligator  never  did  come. But  the  idea  of  mr  alligator  coming  actually  saved  my  sanity  and  made  it, ok  for  me  to  keep  going. Because  i  believed  in  the  distance, there  would  be  someone  coming  to  rescue  me.
They're, like  the  Mercedes-benz  of  the  rift  valley, 
And  He'd  show  up, obviously, in  a  form  that  it  took  me  a  long  time  to  understand, which  is  that  when  we  give  in  the  world, what  we  want  the  most  we  heal  the  broken  part  inside  each  of  us.
We  can  reconcile  
We  can  do  everything  
My  mother  died  in  [a], Gynecology  complication.
Maybe  i  should  become  an  historian, or  maybe  a  reporter  
She  graduated  in  russia, also, 
I  succeeded  in  my  place.
That's  the  best  part  
Our  country  has  two  exploration  programs.
We  learned  of  marshall, Kay's, Geosynclinal  cycle, which  is  a  bunch  of  crap.
Mostly  discoveries  made  by  accident.
I  believe  in  just  enriching  the  economy  
Alvin  and  sea  cliff  and  Cyana  and  all  the  major  deep  submersibles, we  have  which  are  about  eight  
The  mid-ocean  ridge  runs  around  like  the  Seam  on  a  baseball  
This  is  on  a  Mercator  projection.
But  if  you  were  to  put  it  on  an  equal  area  projection, You'd, see  that  the  mid-ocean  ridge  covers  23  percent  of  the  Earth's  total  surface  area  
This  is  what  a  real  one  looks  like  on  the  juan  de  Fuca  ridge, 
But  more  importantly, they  discovered  Edifices  down  there  that  they  did  not  understand  
We  found  the  Bismarck  in  16000  feet, we  then  found  the  Yorktown  
And  we  stole  recently  a  ship  from  the  united  states  navy, 
It  comes  online  this  summer, and  it  begins  its  journey  of  exploration.
We  have  no  idea  what  We're  going  to  discover  
And  when  you  get  a  jaw  drop, you  can  inform  
This  i  hope  will  be  a  future  engineer  or  a  future  scientist  in  the  battle  for  truth.
You  must  get  them  custom  made  --  special  humongous  guitars, 
I  thought, Narcissism  meant  you  loved  yourself  
But  i  want  to  though  explain  how  i  came  to  design  my  own  particular  brand  of  comedy  because  I've  been  through  so  many  different  forms  of  it  
I  started  with  improvisation  in  a  particular  form  of  improvisation  called  theater  games, which  had  one  rule, which  i  always  thought  was  a  great  rule  for  an  ethic  for  a  society.
But  only  two  percent  Don't  know  the  effect  that  the  Debacle  in  argentina  will  have  on  the  Imf's  monetary  policy  --  seems  a  contradiction  
So  this  Subject-object  thing  is  part  of  something  I'm  very  interested  in  because  this  is  why, frankly, i  believe  in  political  correctness, 
Maybe  too  far, but  you  know  --  i  Don't  think  that  a  person  of  color  making  fun  of  white  people  is  the  same  thing  as  a  white  person, making  fun  of  people  of  color  
There  always  had  to  be  the  butt  of  a  joke  
And  then  coming  to  this  conference, i  realized  that  most  everybody  here  shared  those  same  qualities.
I  hope  That's  my  agent  because  you  Aren't  paying  me  anything  
And  he  said  that  i  had  to  show  more  respect  because  it  took  up  to  18  years  to  learn  how  to  do  mime  properly.
Huh, huh? What  Can't?
But  Here's  how  i  think  i  like  to  make  change, and  that  is  in  making  connections  
And  Didn't  that  feel  good  
And  now, We're  being  penetrated  
I  still  have  a  way  to  go  
And  what  i  hope  to  do  when  i  make  these  connections  is  short  circuit, People's, thinking, 
I  like  to  think  of  what  i  do  as  a  probability  wave  
And  thank  you  for  inviting  me  into  it.
Can  we  run  that  andrew  
I  would  propose, therefore  that  if  we  took  10  billion  dollars  from  that  213  trillion  dollar  budget  --  which  is  two  one  Hundredths  of  that  budget  --  and  we  Doled  out  a  billion  dollars  to  each  one  of  these  problems  I'm  going  to  talk  to  you  about  the  vast  majority  could  be  solved  and  the  rest  we  could  deal  with. So  i  hope  you  find  this  both  fascinating  --  I'm  fascinated  by  this  kind  of  stuff.
We  live  in  an  incredible  age  of  modern  medicine, 
We  are  all  much  healthier  than  we  were  20  years  ago.
Soon  genetic  breakthroughs  and  even  better  medicine  are  going  to  allow  us  to  think  of  100  as  a  normal  lifespan.
We  Don't  really  have  mental  health  insurance  in  this  country  and  It's  --  --  It's  really  a  crime  
So  what  are  the  solutions  to  this  
Thank  god, you  can  all  read  
Many  other  ecosystems  on  earth  are  in  real  real  danger, 
They  expect  them  to  evaporate  
This  stuff  was  supposed  to  only  be  feed  for  animals  in  the  united  states, and  it  got  into  the  human  food  supply.
This  brings  back  a  skepticism  that  has  gone  away  recently  that  Superweeds  and  Superpests  could  spread  around  the  world  from  biotechnology  that  literally  could  destroy  the  World's  food  supply  in  very  short  order  
Believe  it  or  not. This  happens  every  few  hundred  thousand  years  and  has  happened  many  times  in  our  history.
But  what  happens  as  this  occurs  is  that  we  lose  our  magnetic  field  around  the  earth  over  the  period  of  about  100  years.
So  maybe  We're  in  the  Throes  of  it  
There's  a  flip  side  to  it  in  studying  stars, like  our  sun  We've  found  that  they  go  through  periods  of  Diminishment  when  their  total  amount  of  energy  That's  expelled  from  them  goes  down  by  maybe  one  percent  
We've  all  learned  what  --  the  kind  of  panic  that  can  occur  when  an  old  disease  Rears  its  head, like  anthrax, 
Again, we  Gotta  think  about  being  a  colonizing  race, 
That's  a  mistake  that  could  literally  cost  us  our  future  
And  he  scans  across  the  ocean, and  he  looks  at  the  sky  
Now, i  Don't  expect  all  of  you  to  see  all  the  details  here. But  what  i  want  you  to  see  is  this  is  about  10  percent  of  the  processes  that  operate  within  the  oceans  almost  continuously  and  have  for  the  last  4  billion  years.
This  is  very, very  important. Because  this  is  the  system. This  is  the  Crucible  out  of  which  life  on  the  planet  came  and  It's  now  time  for  us  to  understand  it.
All  right  Let's  talk  about  another  perspective  on  the  importance  of  the  oceans.
Seconds  after  this  video  was  taken  people  in  beijing.
I  Won't  talk  a  lot  about  most  of  them  right  here.
This  is  going  to  be  much  more  powerful  than  having  a  single  ship  in  a  single  location, then  move  to  a  new  location.
Robotics  systems  are  just  incredible  these  days, absolutely  incredible  
What  are  the  troops?
They  Eject  it  to  the  surface  where  it  floats, and  it  is  picked  up  by  an  autonomous  airplane  and  It's  brought  back  to  the  laboratory  within  24  hours  of  the  eruption  
A  laboratory, many  of  you  heard  what  happened  on  9/7  
We  could  do  work  on  the  sea  floor  that  would  be  stunning, and  it  would  be  on  live  tv.
So  we  can  bring  an  entirely  new  telepresence  to  the  world  throughout  the  ocean.
It's  going  to  be  amazing  
He  won  the  nobel  prize  for  literature  in  1948  
But  it  is  a  story  of  effort  and  struggle  against  Improbabilities  
These  are  the  dimensions  that  i  like  to  work  with  
It's  something  very  personal  
It's, not  perhaps  the  dimensions  appreciated  by  art  critics  or  architecture  critics  or  city, planners  ,
And  today  we  have  a  kind  of  evangelical  pessimism  all  around  us.
I  have  never  been  a  fan  of  the  neutral  
Expressive  spaces  are  not  spaces  that  simply  confirm  what  we  already  know.
Life  is  not  just  an  Anesthetic  to  make  us  smile, but  to  reach  out  across  the  abyss  of  history  to  places  we  have  never  been  and  would  have  perhaps  been  had.
Radical, what  does  it  mean  It's? Something, which  is  rooted  and  something  which  is  rooted  deep  in  a  tradition?
It's, not  something  that  has  a  good  ending  or  a  bad  ending.
Therefore, i  believe  it  should  not  be  cool.
Listening  to  all  of  you, the  complexity  of  thought, the  complexity  of  layers  of  meaning  is  overwhelming  
The  political  is  not  an  enemy  of  architecture.
So  the  unexpected  is  always  unexpected.
So  not  the  habitual  architecture  that  Instills  in  us, the  false  sort  of  stability, but  an  architecture  that  is  full  of  tension, an  architecture  that  goes  beyond  itself  to  reach  a  human  soul  and  a  human  heart. And  that  breaks  out  of  the  Shackles  of  habits.
What  is  raw? The  raw  i  would  say, is  the  naked  experience  untouched  by  luxury  untouched  by  expensive  materials, untouched  by  the  kind  of  Refinement  that  we  associate  with  high  culture.
So  that  is  indeed, what  is  memory  
And  It's  not  only  our  memory. But  those  who  remember  us, which  means  that  architecture  is  not  mute.
You  know, it  costs  a  lot  of  money  and  so  on. But  yes, it  should  not  play  it. Safe.
It's  about  carving  out  a  space  for  trees, 
And  yet, in  all  its  Messiness  in  all  its  difficulties, i  would  not  have  liked  somebody  to  say.
And  it  is  about  the  dirty  word.
It's, difficult  2011, 2013  freedom  tower, the  memorial  
Daniel  libeskind, look: we  have  to  cure  ourselves  of  the  notion  that  we  are  authoritarian  that  we  can  determine  everything  that  happens.
Namibia  has  got  21  million  people, but  it  is  only  twice  the  size  of  california  
Most  people  that  are  following  the  story  of  Angelina  Jolie  and  brad  pitt  will  know  where  namibia  is  
You  might  wonder, why  are  you  wearing  these  western  clothes?
Boy, if  you  are  looking  after  our  livestock  and  you  see  a  cheetah, eating  our  goat  --  cheetah  is  very  nervous  --  just  walk  up  to  it.
But  then  he  said, boy, if  you  run  into  a  lion  Don't, move  
We  lived  under  apartheid  regime.
And  then, in  the  same  year, we  almost  lost  everything  
With  independence, the  whole  approach  of  community, getting  involved  was  embraced  by  our  new  government  
Three  things  that  actually  help  to  build  on  this  foundation. The  very  first  one  is  honoring  of  tradition  and  being  open  to  new  ideas.
And  at  this  sacred  fire, the  spirit  of  our  ancestors, speak  through  the  Headman  and  advise  us  where  to  get  water  where  to  get  Grazings  and  where  to  go  and  hunt  
Transporting  Rhinos  using  helicopters. I   think  is  much  easier  than  talking  through  a  spirit  that  you  Can't  see  Isn't.
The  other  partners  that  we  have  got  is  business  communities, 
And  so  far  with  the  support  of  world  wildlife  fund, We've  been  able  to  scale  up  the  very  small  programs  to  national  programs  today.
Namibia  or  Sesfontein  was  no  more  an  isolated  village  somewhere  hidden  away  in  namibia  
What  started  as  very  small  community  rangers, getting  community  involved  has  now  grown  into  something  that  we  call  Conservancies  
In  2008  Conservancy  generated  57  million  dollars  
This  is  our  new  economy  --  an  economy  based  on  the  respect  of  our  natural  resources.
You  know  that  africa  is  being  affected  by  these  viruses.
There  is  great  confusion  when  the  two  look  at  each  other  
I'm  fascinated  by  the  beauty  of  it, the  Mutability  of  it, the  malleability  of  it  and  the  fabulous  shapes  in  which  it  can  carve  itself.
That's  outside  antarctica  
It's  a  big  undertaking. I   stand  here  before  you  tonight  as  an  ambassador  for  my  whole  team.
There's, a  lot  of  people  working  on  this  right  now, 
If  everybody  in  the  developed  world  understood  this  graph  and  Emblazoned  it  on  the  inside  of  their  Foreheads, there  would  be  no  further  societal  argument  about  climate  change.
This  is  what  one  of  our  cameras  saw  over  the  course  of  a  few  months.
That's  the  retreat  of  this  glacier  
Geologic  process  in  action  here, 
Greenland  took  a  little  while  to  start  reacting  to  the  warming  climate  of  the  past  century, but  it  really  started  galloping  along  about  20  years  ago.
Helicopter  in  front  of  the  calving  face  for  scale, quickly  dwarfed  
It's  flowing  out  to  the  atlantic  ocean  on  the  left  
We  just  downloaded  these  pictures  a  couple  weeks  ago, as  you  can  see, june  25th  monster, calving  events  happened.
Huge  icebergs  rolling  over  
So  an  illustration, again, gives  you  a  feeling  for  scale.
This  is  a  terrific  terrific  call  to  arms  to  do  the  right  thing  for  ourselves.
Understanding  all  of  this  enables  us  to  shift  our  perception  of  seafood  away  from  a  commodity  to  an  opportunity  to  restore  our  ecosystem  
Great  for  fishermen, lots  of  money  supporting  local  economies  
So  the  first  thing  about  this  idea  of  restorative  seafood  is  that  it  really  takes  into  account  our  needs  
And  the  best  part  is  all  of  those  ingredients  are  available  to  every  family  at  the  neighborhood. Walmart.
Forget  nuclear  holocaust  It's, the  fork  that  we  have  to  worry  about  
People  started  buying  Appetizers  and  salads  because  they  knew  they  Weren't  going  to  fill  up  on  the  Entrees  alone.
People  spent  more  time  engaging  in  their  meals  engaging  with  each  other  over  their  meals  
They  got  healthier, i  made  more  money.
I  get  sick  when  i  go  to  Steakhouses  
The  punch  line  
And  this  is  a  song  medley: i  put  together  --  did  you  ever  notice  that  four  in  the  morning  has  become  some  sort  of  meme  or  shorthand  
A  time  for  plotting  to  whack  the  chief  of  police, like  in  this  classic  scene  from  the  godfather  
It  works  a  little  something  like  --  this  is  a  recent  google  search  for  four  in  the  morning.
Coincidence  to  me  has  a  much  simpler  metric  
Herbert  powell, sure, That's  what  He's  paid  for  
And  folks, you  can  buy  a  copy  of  bill  Clinton's, my  life  from  the  bookstore  here  at  ted  
By  his  own  writing, this  man  was  either  asleep  at  a  prayer  meeting  with  al  and  tipper  or  learning  how  to  launch  a  nuclear  missile  out  of  a  suitcase  
And  once  we  get  involved  in  the  therapeutic  decisions  again, either  personally  or  with  our  loved  ones  and  family  members, we  also  very  quickly, learn  the  benefits, the  trade-offs  and  the  limitations  of  these  tools.
We  can  all  picture  astronauts  in  space, 
And  in  that  space  station, we  have  the  genetic  material, the  chromosomes  within  a  nucleus  
And  when  that  cellular  space  station  is  within  the  electric  field, it  acts  on  those  highly  charged  proteins  and  Aligns  them  
What  we  saw  in  that  trial  is  that  that  the  life  expectancies  of  both  groups  --  so  the  chemotherapy  treated  group  and  the  tumor  treating  field  group  --  was  the  same  
Importantly, it  was  the  first  time  ever  that. The  fda  included  in  their  approval  of  an  oncology  treatment, a  quality  of  life  claim.
You  can  see  that  the  black  regions  in  the  upper  right  Quadrant  are  the  areas  where  he  had  surgery.
At  this  point  he  was  told  by  his  doctors  that  he  had  about  3  months  to  live  
First  of  all, these  electrodes  are  noninvasive  
There's, none  of  what  is  called  the  chemo  head  
It's  a  medical  device.
It's  now, five  years  since  Robert's  diagnosis  and  He's  alive, but  importantly, He's  healthy  and  He's  at  work  
I'm  going  to  let  him  in  this  very  short  clip, describe  his  impressions  of  the  therapy  in  his  own  words, 
I'm  going  to  show  you  another  clip  of  a  woman  named  lydia  
She  underwent  four  different  regimes  of  chemotherapy  over  two  years.
Her  cancer  continued  to  grow  
She's  interacting  with  her  kids  and  her  grand  kids  
It's  only  the  beginning  
And  i  firmly  believe  that  in  the  next  10  years, tumor  treating  fields  will  be  a  weapon  available  to  doctors  and  patients  for  all  of  these  Most-difficult-to-treat  solid  tumors, 
And  the  water  will  go  where  it  should  go  
And  people  made  their  house  and  the  water  storage  tanks  
This  is  near  jaipur.
It  can  break  sometimes  
It  can  envy  many  municipalities, the  color  the  taste, the  purity  of  this  water  
And  people  started  renovating  their  own  structures.
Such  a  limited  rainfall  and  highest  colorful  life  flourished  in  these  areas.
But  it  is  invisible  
And  then  they  will  come  and  worship  this  pond, pay  respect  their  gratitude  
And  perhaps  they  knew  the  future  also  
How  they  maintain  them  
Don't  spit  Don't  do  anything  wrong.
If  you  climb  these  three  six  steps, you  will  find  something  very  nice  
They  say  that  a  picture  is  worth  a  thousand  words. So  we  can  say  a  thousand  words  right  now.
There  were  no  english  medium  schools  at  that  time, even  no  hindi  schools, [unclear]  schools, 
But  not  to  create  the  engineering  colleges, 
So  you  can  find  through  your  jeep, a  camel  and  a  cart  
Thank  you  very  much  
So  the  ponds, the  open  bodies  are  everywhere  right  from  sri  lanka  to  Kashmir.
And  these  [unclear]  which  stored  water, there  are  two  type  of  things.
It  was  never  popular  with  many  political  leaders, especially  those  in  the  united  states, who  somehow  thought  that  new  media  would  be  able  to  do  what  missiles  Couldn't  
And  they  are  building  what  i  call  the  Spinternet  
And  police  said  that  it  happened  because  he  was  playing  hide  and  seek, which  is  Elude  the  cat  in  chinese  Slang  with  other  inmates  and  hit  his  head  against  the  wall, which  was  not  an  explanation  which  sat  well  with  many  chinese  bloggers  
So  they  immediately  began  posting  a  lot  of  critical  comments.
And  this  actually  fits  with  another  interesting  theory  about  What's  happening  in  authoritarian  states  and  in  their  cyberspace  
And  first  It's  quite  simple  
So  from  this  perspective, having  blogs  and  wikis  produce  knowledge  has  been  great  
So  inviting  people  to  all  sorts  of  public  forums, having  them  participate  in  decision, making  It's  actually  great  
And  It's  great  simply  because  they  can  gather  open  source  intelligence, 
I  mean, Kgb  and  not  just  Kgb  used  to  torture  in  order  to  actually  get  this  data  
Now, It's  all  available  online  
So, what  should  we  do  about  it?
Why  are  you  crying  
No  the  boy  said  to  me  --  the  boy  said  to  me, it  would  destroy  me.
And  he  did  spend  a  lot  of  time  up  to  no  good  
His  father  Wasn't  on  the  set  
We  all  looked  up  to  him  
She's  what  i  know  today  to  be  mentally  ill  Higher-functioning  at  times  than  others, 
So  when  i  go  in  the  room, i  close  the  door  
Now, i  say  this  all  with  remorse, and  i  was  feeling  a  tremendous  amount  of  remorse  at  that  time. But  i  was  Conflicted.
I  need  you  working  with  me  and  me  working  with  you  on  how  we  raise  our  sons  and  teach  them  to  be  men  --  that  It's, okay, to  not  be  dominating  that  It's. Okay, to  have  feelings  and  emotions  that  It's. Okay, to  promote  equality  that  It's. Okay, to  have  women  who  are  just  friends  and  That's  it  that  It's.
Indeed, what  worries  me  is  the  entire  notion  of  world  leadership  seems  to  me  terribly  archaic  
It's  Redolent  of  james  bond  movies  and  Kipling  ballads  
And  in  the  information  era, we  all  live  in  today, what  we  might  call  the  ted  age  I'd, say  that  countries  are  increasingly  being  judged  by  a  global  public  That's, been  fed  on  an  Incessant  diet  of  internet  news  of  Televised  images  of  cellphone  videos  of  email, gossip, 
We've  been  selling  15  million  cellphones  a  month  
They  had  to  suspend  functions  at  830  
And  they  Scrawled  on  the  windshield  in  a  reference  to  the  Show's, heroine  Tulsi  Zindabad  long, live  Tulsi, 
In  fact, legend  has  is  that  when  Doubting  thomas  the  Apostle, saint  thomas  landed  on  the  shores  of  kerala, my  home  state  somewhere  around  52  ad.
But  the  fact  is  that  the  last  elections  five  years  ago  gave  the  world  extraordinary  phenomenon  of  an  election  being  won  by  a  woman  political  leader  of  italian  origin  and  roman  catholic  faith  Sonia, gandhi, who  then  made  way  for  a  Sikh  Mohan  singh  to  be  Sworn  in  as  prime  minister  by  a  muslim, president  abdul  Kalam  in  a  country, 81  percent  hindu  
All  the  others  have  been  all  those  three  
In  fact, you  Can't  even  take  the  name  of  the  country  for  granted  because  the  name  india  comes  from  the  river.
It's  the  idea  of  an  Ever-ever-land  emerging  from  an  ancient  civilization, united  by  a  shared  history, but  sustained  above  all  by  Pluralist  democracy  
Now, that  is  the  india  that  is  emerging  into  the  21st  century.
And  i  mean, the  world  apparently  is  running  out  too  
And  trying  to  attach  this  to  things  that  were  themselves  attached  to  certain  specific  target  zones  bacteria  that  we  Don't  like  
So  you  can  find  a  little  feature  on  a  bacterium  that  you  Don't  like  like  Staphylococcus  --  i  Don't  like  it  in  particular  because  it  killed  a  professor  friend  of  mine.
So  this  was  pretty  shocking  to  me  that  we  could  do  this  
And  There's  the  very  important  thing  there, if  you  want  to  survive  the  cold, you  ought  to  be  suspended  right. .
The  highest  concentration  is  in  our  brains.
And  so  we  wanted  to  find  out  might  we  be  able  to  use  hydrogen  sulfide  in  the  presence  of  cold, and  we  wanted  to  see  whether  we  could  reproduce  this  skier  in  a  mammal  
So  we  wondered, can  we  do  anything  useful  with  this  capacity  to  control  metabolic  flexibility?
We  ought  to  be  able  to  lower  supply  to  unprecedented  low  levels  without  killing  the  animal  
And  this  company, the  first  thing  it  did  was  make  a  liquid  Formulation  of  hydrogen  sulfide, an  Injectable  form  that  we  could  put  in  and  send  it  out  to  physician. Scientists  all  over  the  world  who  work  on  models  of  critical  care  medicine. And  the  results  are  incredibly  positive  .
And  i  should  say  that  the  concentrations  of  hydrogen  sulfide  required  to  get  this  benefit  are  low  incredibly  low  
You  Don't  want  to  be  Gorking  people  out  just  to  save  them, It's, really  confusing  
I’m  going  around  the  world, giving  talks  about  darwin  and  usually  what  I’m  talking  about  is  Darwin’s  strange  inversion  of  reasoning  
Exactly  exactly, and  it  is  a  strange  inversion.
If  you  looked  at  glucose  molecules  till  you  were  blind, you  Wouldn’t  see  why  they  tasted  sweet  
And  It’s  a  good  thing  that  there  Isn’t, because  if  there  were  then  mother, nature  would  have  a  problem. How  on  earth?
What  we  see  with  say, chocolate  cake  is  It’s  a  supernormal  stimulus  to  tweak  our  design  wiring  
You’ve  got  30  seconds, You’d  better, be  fast  
Yes, Lot’s  of  laughter.
So  we  might  have  a  wild  idea, but  We’re  afraid  to  share  it  with  anybody  else.
They  just  quite  happily, show  their  masterpiece  to  whoever  wants  to  look  at  it.
Now  that  Wasn’t  just  Self-indulgence  
It  takes  more  than  Decor, but  i  think  We’ve  all  seen  that  creative  companies  do  often  have  symbols  in  the  workplace  that  remind  people  to  be  playful, and  that  It’s  a  Permissive  environment, 
But  why  is  it  important  
We  use  it  in  a  pretty  pragmatic  way  to  be  honest, 
And  you  know, the  more  creative  of  them  might  get  to  a  really  interesting  example.
So  another  one  of  bob  Mckim’s  favorite  exercises  is  called  the  30  circles  test  
Okay, put  down  your  pencils, as  they  say, 
15, 20: anybody  get  all  30  
I  just  wanted  you  to  fill  in  as  many  circles  as  possible  
We  stop  ourselves  from  doing  things.
I  think  the  eameses  are  wonderful  examples  of  experimentation.
They  went  from  designing  Splints  for  wounded  soldiers  coming  out  of  world  war  ii  and  the  korean  war  i  think. And  from  this  experiment, they  moved  on  to  chairs.
When  play  is  about  building  a  tower  out  of  blocks, the  kid  begins  to  learn  a  lot  about  towers.
And  as  they  repeatedly  knock  it  down  and  start, again, learning  is  happening  as  a  sort  of  By-product  of  play  
So  they  learned  their  way  to  that  by  building  prototypes  
And  all  of  a  sudden  a  productive  conversation  was  happening  about  design  around  a  tangible  object.
The  prototyping  carts  filled  with  colored  paper  and  play-doh  and  glue  sticks  and  stuff  --  i  mean, they  do  have  a  bit  of  a  kindergarten  feel  to  them  
But  by  giving  project  teams  and  the  clients  who  They’re  working  with  permission  to  think  with  their  hands, quite  complex  ideas  can  spring  into  life  and  go  right  through  to  execution, much  more  easily  
We’re  doing  the  same  thing  as  designers  
So  remember, the  sketching  task, we  did  at  the  beginning  
As  designers  we  need  to  be  able  to  transition  in  and  out  of  play  also  
And  it  Doesn't  take  long  to  go  downhill.
And  i  got  distracted  by  it  
And  suddenly, i  was  on  the  phone  to  my  Stockbroker  and  my  real  estate  agent  when  i  should  have  been  talking  to  my  clients  
My  partner  and  i  thom, we  had  to  let  all  our  employees  go  
Because  with  no  employees, there  was  nobody  for  me  to  manage  
And  i  grew  up  in  this  little  farming  town  in  northern  nevada, 
Britlin  was  so  innocent  and  so  sweet  and  her  voice  was  so  pure  
And  i  had  this  idea  if  i  could  get  50  people  to  all  do  this  same  thing: sing, their  parts  --  soprano, alto, Tenor  and  bass  --  wherever  they  were  in  the  world  post  their  videos  to  youtube.
And  i  sent  out  this  call  to  singers  
And  i  made  free  the  download  of  the  music  to  a  piece  that  i  had  written  in  the  year  2000  called  lux  Aurumque, which  means  light  and  gold  
This  is  Evangelina  Etienne  from  massachusetts, 
I  was  told  later, and  also  by  lots  of  singers  who  were  involved  in  this  that  they  sometimes  recorded  50  or  60  different  takes  until  they  got  just  the  right  take  --  they  uploaded  it  
He  scrubbed  the  audio  
And  then  we  posted  this  video  to  youtube  about  a  year  and  a  half  ago, 
We  had  a  million  hits  in  the  first  month  and  got  a  lot  of  attention  for  it.
And  there  were  900  people  involved  in  that  
And  we  also  put  a  page  on  facebook  for  the  singers  to  upload  their  Testimonials, what  it  was  like  for  them  their  experience  singing  it.
My  sister  and  i  used  to  sing  in  choirs  together, constantly  
Me  too  
It  is  a  dream  come  true  to  be  part  of  this  choir  as  I've  never  been  part  of  one  
And  the  second  is  that  people  seem  to  be  experiencing  an  actual  connection.
It  Wasn't  a  virtual  choir  
But  i  know  myself  too, i  feel  this  virtual  Esprit  de  corps  if  you  will  with  all  of  them  
This  is  a  recording  i  made  of  a  mantis  shrimp  That's  found  off  the  coast  of  california  
And  mantis  shrimp  are  called  mantis  shrimp  after  the  praying  Mantises, which  also  have  a  fast  feeding  appendage. And  i  started  to  think, well, maybe  it  will  be  interesting  while  listening  to  their  sounds  to  figure  out  how  these  animals  generate  very  fast  feeding  strikes.
So  we  got  this  incredible  video  system  It's, very  new  technology  --  it  just  came  out  about  a  year  ago  --  that  allows  you  to  film  at  extremely  high  speeds  in  low  light  
And  as  You'll  notice  It's  still  pretty  gosh, darn  fast  slowed  down  333  times  It's, an  incredibly  powerful  movement.
So  what  we  calculated  was  that  the  limbs  were  moving  at  the  peak  speed, ranging  from  10  meters  per  second, all  the  way  up  to  23  meters  per  second  
It  takes  a  long  time  for  the  muscle  to  contract  and  a  very  short  time  for  the  limb  to  fly  out  
There  needs  to  be  some  kind  of  Spring-loaded  mechanism  in  order  to  generate  the  amount  of  force  that  we  observe  and  the  speed  that  we  observe  and  the  output  of  the  system.
The  saddle-shaped  structure  is  also  known  as  a  hyperbolic  Paraboloid  surface  or  an  Anticlastic  surface.
In  biological  systems, It's  important, not  to  have  a  whole  lot  of  extra  material  requirements  for  building  it  
And  so  this  is  just  a  regular  video  of  the  animal  just  smashing.
And  again, i  think  this  will  be  a  world  record.
And  what  I'd  like  you  to  do  in  this  shot  is  keep  your  eye  on  this  on  the  surface  of  the  load  cell, as  the  limb  comes  flying  through  
People  have  been  struggling  for  years  to  try  and  design  a  very  fast  rotating  boat  propeller  that  Doesn't  Cavitate  and  literally  wear  away  the  metal  and  put  holes  in  it.
In  fact, you  might  have  even  seen  some  cavitation  going  up  the  edge  of  the  limb.
Very, very  convenient  solution  to  that  particular  problem, 
And  There's  actually  a  spectacular  colored  dot  in  the  center  of  the  saddles  of  many  species  of  stomatopods  
And  this  is  quite  interesting  to  find  evolutionary  origins  of  visual  signals  on  What's, really  in  all  species, their  spring  
And  so  I'm, very  curious  about  whether  those  colored  dots  in  the  center  of  the  saddles  are  conveying  some  kind  of  information  about  their  ability  to  strike  or  their  strike  force. And  something  about  the  time  period  in  the  molting  cycle.
We  still  have  one  foot  in  the  dark, ages  
Ts, eliot  really  said  it  for  me  --  and  this  should  give  you  goose  bumps. We  shall  not  cease  from  exploration. And  the  end  of  our  exploring  shall  be  to  return  where  we  started  and  know  the  place  for  the  first  time.
It’s, a  thin  film, two-dimensional  existence, 
And  if  you  Hefted  those  two  things, you  might  find  that  the  relative  scale  of  those  is  20  to  1  
It  actually  is  a  very  good  working  sub  --  That’s  what  it  was  designed  for  
A  seat  works  in  a  two-dimensional  world  where  gravity  blasts  down  on  that  seat.
Most  of  life  on  earth  is  in  that  inner  atmosphere.
This  is  a  three-dimensional  machine.
This  is  Man’s  first  attempt  at  flying  underwater  
Chris  asked  us  to  show  stuff  that  Hasn’t  been  shown  before  
I’m  trying  to  do  everything  very  gently  
This  is  the  first  flying  machine.
There’re, no, silly  Buoyancy  tanks  --  It’s, permanently  positively  buoyant  
She’s  just  a  few  inches  off  the  top  of  my  head  
And  so  how  i  see  my  work  contributing  is  sort  of  trying  to  literally  Re-imagine  these  connections  and  physically, rebuild  them  
So  the  era  of  big  infrastructure  is  over  
So, albeit  a  very  small  creature  and  very  modest  this  creature  is  incredible  because  it  can  Agglomerate  into  these  Mega-reef  structures.
But  you  can  see  even  just  intuit  from  this  map  that  the  harbor  has  Dredged  and  flattened  and  went  from  a  rich  three-dimensional  mosaic  to  flat  muck  in  really  a  matter  of  years.
Now, the  gowanus  is  particularly  smelly  --  i  will  admit  it  
When  we  started  this  project, one  of  the  core  ideas  was  to  look  back  in  history  and  try  to  understand  what  was  there  
We  also  learned  at  this  time  that  you  could  eat  an  oyster  about  the  size  of  a  dinner  plate  in  the  gowanus  canal  itself  
It  accepts  algae  and  Detritus  in  one  end  and  through  this  beautiful  glamorous  set  of  stomach  organs  out.
Basically  new  york  was  built  on  the  backs  of  Oystermen, and  our  streets  were  literally  built  over  oyster  shells.
What  is  fuzzy  rope?
So  we  imagine  that  we  would  actually  potentially  even  host  a  bake  sale  to  start  our  new  project.
So  get  your  Tevas  on  
And  then  those  spat  are  then  seeded  
And  also  showing  oyster  gardening  for  the  community  along  its  edges.
And  finally, how  much  fun  it  would  be  to  watch  the  Flupsy  parade  and  cheer  on  the  oyster  Spats  as  they  go  down  to  the  reef  
So  sorry  --  it  just  feels  like  i  should  be  doing  stand-up  up  here  because  of  the  setting  
Because  if  we  get  it  out  of  the  streets, It'll  smell  much  better. And  --  oh, right?
And  He'd  made  the  case  in  a  number  of  papers  and  done  a  number  of  studies.
You  Can't  really  see  it  in  this  map. But  this  is  the  map  that  becomes  the  central  focus  in  the  second  half  of  my  book.
So  it  was  this  incredibly  terrifying  event.
Just  an  extraordinary, terrifying  scene, 
And  eventually, snow  made  a  map  of  the  outbreak  
And  he  thought  about  representing  that  as  a  kind  of  a  table  of  statistics  of  people  living  in  different  neighborhoods, people  who  Hadn't, you  know, percentages  of  people  who  Hadn't.
And  so  with  the  help  of  this  map  and  with  the  help  of  more  Evangelizing  that  he  did  over  the  next  few  years, and  that  whitehead  did  eventually, actually  the  authorities  slowly  started  to  come  around  
We  Don't  worry  that  new  york  city  is  going  to  collapse  in  on  itself  quite  the  way  that  you  know, rome  did  and  be  10  percent  of  its  size  in  100  years  or  200  years.
His  whole  monastery  was  thrown  into  prison  at  the  time  of  the  uprising  when  the  dalai  lama  had  to  leave  tibet.
And  it  just  so  happened  on  the  fifth  week, there  was  a  public  teaching  by  the  dalai  lama  
I  interview  and  do  portraits  
So  this  is  our  icon  to  Non-violence  in  our  world  --  one  of  our  living  icons  
This  is  Mengatoue  
He's  the  shaman  of  the  huaorani, and  he  said  to  us, you  know, I'm  an  older  man. Now, I'm  getting  tired. You  know, I'm  tired  of  Spearing.
And  this  kid  lived  in  the  village  --  he  Wasn't  there  at  the  time  --  and  this  is  the  little  movie.
It's  a  question  of  What's, the  continuity  
We  draw  this  set  of  nested  spheres  cut  away.
So  if  you  take  a  picture  of  What's  going  on  It's  10  years  ago, 
And  we  go  through  a  period  of  accelerating  expansion  and  the  universe  expands  and  cools  until  it  gets  to  the  point  where  it  becomes  transparent, then  to  the  dark  ages, and  then  the  first  stars  turn  on  and  they  evolve  into  galaxies.
I  always  think  of  space-time  as  being  the  real  substance  of  space  and  the  galaxies  and  the  stars, just  like  the  foam  on  the  ocean  
And  just  put  Radially  They're  going  out  that  way, 
What  happens  is  you  take  pictures  as  the  earth  rotates, you  get  a  fan  across  the  sky.
Do  you  see  the  Fan-like  scans  made  across  the  sky  
So, again, you  can  see  the  extension  of  this  great  wall  of  galaxies  showing  up  here.
And  we  had  to  add  one  more  thing  to  make  the  universe  come  out  right?
So  I'll  show  you  the  next  movie.
We're  going  to  keep  zooming  in.
And  so  i  forgot  to  tell  you  the  scale  
So  it  takes  light  three  billion  years  to  travel  over  that  distance.
There's  a  very  simple  fluid  to  begin  with  
And  so  you  know, when  you  first  saw  this  picture, it  Didn't  mean  quite  so  much  to  you  
Here  You're, looking  across  one  percent  of  the  volume  of  the  visible  universe  and  You're  seeing  billions  of  galaxies, right  and  nodes. But  you  realize  They're, not  even  the  main  structure.
And  We're  going  to  fly  around  and  We'll  fly  around  and  You'll  see  occasionally  a  couple  of  filaments  intersect, and  you  get  a  large  cluster  of  galaxies  
So  the  question  is, how  hard  would  it  be  to  assemble  this  right? ?
And  so  here  we  are  
This  is  how  if  you  took  billions  of  years  to  go  around, it  might  look  to  you  right.
And  if  you  could  see  invisible  matter  too  ,
We're  going  to  start  and  realize  that  the  entire  visible  universe, everything  we  can  see  in  every  direction  with  the  hubble  space  telescope, plus  our  other  instruments, was  once  in  a  region  that  was  smaller  than  an  atom.
So  I'm  going  to  show  you  one  that  can  be  run  on  a  desktop  in  two  days  in  the  next  picture, 
And  at  that  point, the  universe, mysteriously  starts  accelerating  its  expansion  and  cuts  off  the  formation  of  Larger-scale  structure.
The  fact  is  that  We're  living  longer  
It  really  involves  many  different  areas.
And  That's  where  the  field  is  today, 
We  then  grow  the  cells  outside  the  body, take  the  scaffold  coat  the  scaffold  with  the  cells  --  the  Patient's  own  cells, two  different  cell  types, 
So  the  strategy  here  is  --  this  is  actually  a  ct  scan, an  x-ray  --  and  we  go  layer  by  layer  using  computerized  Morphometric  imaging  analysis  and  3d  reconstruction  to  get  right  down  to  those  Patient's  own  kidneys.
And  this  is  actually  a  new  technology  We're  working  on  now  
I  was  able  to  do  more  things  
Most  of  my  professors  were  all  for  it, and  they  said, bring  pictures  and  show  me  the  clips  online  and  I'm  happy  for  you  
'i  Failed', he  cried  
One  was  --  never  be  late, never  be  late  
That's  what  he  tried  to  teach  me  and  my  brothers  at  one  time, 
He  spelled  moriarty  with  only  one  'i'  
You  and  i  know  deeper  down  There's, always  a  chance  to  win  the  crown  
Giving  all  it  seems  to  me  is  not  so  far  from  victory  
Don't  whine: Don't  complain  Don't, make  excuses  
Not  necessary  to  what  you  would  want  them  to  be, but  they  will  be  about  what  they  should. And  only  you  will  know  whether  you  can  do  that.
I  mention  in  my  book, they  call  me  coach  ,
So  they  had  qualities  that  --  they  came  close  to  --  as  close  to  reaching  possibly  their  full  potential  as  any  players.
So  in  other  words, What's  happening  here  is  that  swaptree  solves  my  carrying  Company's, sugar  rush  problem.
So  What's  happening  here  
We're  Bartering  trading  Swapping  sharing, but  They're  being  reinvented  into  dynamic  and  appealing  forms  
Over  the  next  minute  You're  going  to  see  a  bit  like  a  conceptual, fireworks  display  of  all  the  dots  that  went  on  in  my  head  
I  mean, We're  monkeys  and  We're  born  and  bred  to  share  and  cooperate  
And  we  were  doing  so  for  thousands  of  years, whether  It's  when  we  hunted  in  packs  or  farmed  in  Cooperatives  before  this  big  system  called  hyper-consumption  came  along, and  we  built  these  fences  and  created  out  own  little  Fiefdoms  
They're  growing  up  sharing  --  files  video  games, knowledge, 
Thomas  friedman  is  one  of  my  favorite  new  york  times  Columnists.
The  second  is  collaborative  lifestyles, 
Just  think  of  libraries  and  Laundrettes  
They  are  what  i  consider  to  be  the  cities  of  tomorrow, the  new  urban  world  
Now, why  do  i  say  that  
After  we  finished  armstrong, straightened  his  tie, put  on  a  wool, sports  jacket  and  we  headed  out  into  the  glare  
I  thought  they  might  be  playing  king  of  the  hill, but  i  was  wrong.
'it's  a  simple  life, but  nobody  is  restricting  you  
Beer  is  a  very  important  thing  in  brazil  
This  here, on  the  right-hand  side  is  What's  called  a  --  if  you  look  at  the  fine  print  under  the  Awning  --  It's, a  hotel  
And  the  second  aspect  is  that, once  you  have  2000  people  in  the  community, you  can  petition  the  government  to  be  recognized  as  a  legal  Sub-municipality, 
My  family  moved  We're, nomads, 
But  these  two  people  worked  something  out  
Right  now, those  and  other  neurologic  diseases  --  for  which  we  have  no  cure  or  prevention  --  cost  about  a  third  of  a  trillion  dollars.
It  will  be  well  over  a  trillion  dollars  by  2050  
And  the  avian  flu  is  also  not  a  good  idea.
You  should  also  keep  your  blood  pressure  down  because  chronic  high  blood  pressure  is  the  biggest  single  risk  factor  for  Alzheimer’s  disease.
And  of  course, when  it  comes  to  cognitive  effects, use  it  or  lose  it  applies.
And  one  of  the  first  things  that  i  started  to  investigate  was  the  history  of  the  name  of  technology  
And  obviously  technology  had  existed  before  then, but  we  Weren't  aware  of  it. And  so  it  was  sort  of  an  awakening  of  this  force  in  our  life.
And  That's  the  very  first  use  of  the  word  
Even  the  hunter-gatherers  used  some  elementary  tools  
So  climate  change  is  not  a  new  thing.
And  flowers  and  plants  are  the  same  thing  extended. And  technology  is  basically  an  extension  of  life.
And  the  energy  density  that  we  see  in  the  greatest  of  anywhere  in  the  universe  is  actually  in  a  pc  chip  
And  there  are  things  moving  towards  greater  complexity, moving  towards  greater  diversity, moving  towards  greater  specialization, sentience  Ubiquity  and  most  important  Evolvability, those  very  same  things  are  also  present  in  technology.
He  could  buy  things  that  king, henry  in  all  his  wealth  could  never  buy  
And  what  i  mean  by  that  is  that  we  find  a  new  job  for  it.
So  better  ideas  is  really  --  always  the  response  to  technology  that  we  Don't  like  is  basically  better  technology.
And  so  every  technology  is  sort  of  a  creative  force, looking  for  the  right  job.
And  we  are  aware  of  the  price  
Great  movement  that  is  starting  billions  of  years  ago  is  moving  through  us, and  it  continues  to  go  and  our  choice. So  to  speak  in  technology  is  really  to  align  ourselves  with  this  force, much  greater  than  ourselves.
I  really  appreciate  your  attention  today.
Neil  and  i  were  sitting  there, comparing  how  little  We've, slept  in  anticipation  for  this  I've  never  been  so  nervous  --  and  i  do  this  when  I'm  nervous, i  just  realized  
In  the  brooklyn  neighborhood  that  i  lived  in  park  slope, there  are  a  lot  of  writers  --  It's, like  a  very  high  per  capita  ratio  of  writers  to  normal  people  
So  when  i  moved  back  to  san  francisco, we  rented  this  building  
So  we  thought, We'll  have  all  these  writers  and  editors  and  everybody  --  sort  of  a  writing  community  --  coming  into  the  office  every  day. Anyway, why  Don't? We  just  open  up  the  front  of  the  building  for  students  to  come  in  there  after  school, get  extra  help  on  their  written  homework. So  you  have  basically  no  border  between  these  two  communities.
And  we  looked  around  and  somebody  else  said, well, you  should  sell  supplies  to  the  working  Buccaneer  
This  is  replacement  eyes  in  case, you  lose  one  
While  You're  reading  the  sign, we  pull  a  rope  behind  the  counter  and  eight  mop  heads  drop  on  your  head.
It  became  mop  heads. And  this  is  the  fish  theater, which  is  just  a  saltwater  tank  with  three  seats. And  then  right  behind  it. We  set  up  this  space, which  was  the  tutoring  center.
And  we  thought, oh  They're  going  to  storm  the  gates, They're, Gonna, love  it.
You  know, It's  been  proven  that  35  to  40  hours  a  year  with  one-on-one  attention.
But  there  was  something  psychological  happening  there.
They're  allowed  to  go  home  at  530, Pm, enjoy  their  family, enjoy  other  hobbies, get  outside  play.
Then  we  said, well, what  are  we  going  to  do  with  the  space  during  the  day? Because  it  has  to  be  used  before  230?
So  this  is  one  of  the  books  that  they  do  
So  meanwhile, There's  an  adult  in  the  back  typing  this  up, taking  it  completely  seriously, which  blows  their  mind  
It's  right  off  the  library, and  there  we  serve  all  529  kids  in  this  middle  school  
You  can  see  amy  tan  sponsored  the  next  one  i  might  get  somewhere  
We  sell  all  the  student  books  
They  would  say, what  is  this  
So  the  store  actually  did  really  well  
This  is  sam  Potts', great  design  that  did  this  
This  is  a  little  Vault  --  you  have  to  put  your  product  in  there. It  goes  up  an  electric  lift. And  then  the  guy  behind  the  counter  tells  you  that  you  have  to  recite  the  vow  of  heroism  which  you  do  if  you  want  to  buy  anything. And  it  limits  really  their  sales.
So  then  the  secret  door  --  this  is  one  of  the  shelves. You  Don't  see  when  you  walk  in, but  it  slowly  opens  .
This  is  one  of  the  students: khaled  Hamdan, 
Came  in  got  this  concentrated  attention, 
I'm  going  to  switch  to  we  and  not, i  hope  we  hope  that  the  attendees  of  this  conference  will  usher  in  a  new  era  of  participation  in  our  public  schools.
We  hope  that  you  will  take  the  lead  in  Partnering, your  innovative  spirit  and  expertise  with  that  of  innovative  educators  in  your  community.
Hot  studio  did  a  great  job  in  a  very  tight  deadline.
I've  been  a  priest  in  the  church  for  20  years.
Do  we  really  believe  that  god  is  the  kind  of  male  boss  that  We've  been  presenting  in  our  worship  and  in  our  Liturgies  over  all  these  years  
Suggesting  that  god  expresses  himself  or  herself  through  Powerlessness, rather  than  power  
Acknowledging  that  god  is  unknown  and  unknowable  by  definition, 
And  this  is  what  i  said, 
And  we  want  an  explanation  from  god  
For  hundreds  of  years, the  prevailing  Orthodoxy  the  accepted  truth  was  that  god, the  father, the  creator  is  unchanging.
And  the  devastating  events  of  the  20th  century  have  forced  people  to  question, the  cold, Unfeeling, god, ,
Who  is  god  in  all  this  
Do  we  have  a  local  god  who  can  do  little  things  like  parking  spaces, but  not  big  things  like  500, Mile-per-hour  waves, 
That's  just  not  acceptable  to  intelligent  christians, and  we  must  acknowledge  it  
You  probably  heard  some  of  them, the  man  who  Surfed  the  wave, the  teenage  girl  who  recognized  the  danger, because  she  had  just  been  learning  about  Tsunamis  at  school  
If  we  believe  something  like  this, we  must  let  go  of  the  Puppet-master  completely  take  our  leave  of  the  almighty  controller. Abandon  traditional  models.
Maybe  god  Isn't  an  agent  like  all  of  us  are  agents  
The  people  knew  their  god  by  his  mighty  acts.
In  the  incredible  Intricacy  and  magnificence  of  the  natural  world  
In  the  end, we  have  to  say, i  Don't  know  
To  have  faith  in  this, god  would  be  more  like  trusting  an  essential  benevolence  in  the  universe  and  less  like  believing  a  system  of  Doctrinal  statements  
And  how  would  one  Deepen  such  a  faith  
But  in  the  end, the  only  thing  i  could  say, for  sure, was  i  Don't  know, and  that  just  might  be  the  most  profoundly  religious  statement  of  all  
It  was  deep  at  night  
And  i  kept  on  staring  at  it  until  it  disappeared, 
This  is  not  a  story  of  a  nameless  survivor  of  war  and  nameless  refugees  whose  stereotypical  images  we  see  in  our  newspapers  and  our  tv  with  Tattered  clothes, dirty  face  scared, eyes, 
War, a  friend  of  mine  said, is  not  about  sound  at  all  
It  is  actually  about  silence.
I  have  since  left  iraq  and  founded  a  group  called  women  for  women, international  that  ends  up  working  with  women  survivors  of  wars  
She  said, but  It's, not  fair  because  there  is  only  one  life, and  there  should  only  be  one  death.
Ninety  percent  of  modern  war  casualties  are  civilians  
How  interesting  
There  is  a  side  that  is  led  by  men. And  there  is  a  side  that  is  led  by  women.
There  is  no  way  we  can  talk  about  the  building  of  stability.
She  got  into  women  for  women  International's  program, 
To  start  with  these  women  that  i  told  you  about  are  dancing  and  singing  every  single  day.
By  accepting  this  dichotomy, whether  It's  Tongue-in-cheek  when  we  attempt  to  accommodate  it  in  our  world, and  we  try  to  build  our  foundation  for  the  world, We're  messing  up  the  future.
Now  i  grew  up  in  the  '60s  and  I'll  admit  it  actually  my  childhood  Spanned, the  '60s, and  i  was  a  Wannabe  hippie.
And  i  know  there  are  people  here  the  younger  generation  who  want  to  be  hippies, but  people  talk  about  the  '60s  all  the  time. And  they  talk  about  the  anarchy  that  was  there. But  when  i  think  about  the  '60s, what  i  took  away  from  it  was  that  there  was  hope  for  the  future.
You  see, i  always  assumed  i  would  go  into  space  because  i  followed  all  of  this, but  i  also  loved  the  arts  and  sciences  
Now, my  mother  helped  me  figure  that  one  out  
But  when  i  went  into  space, when  i  went  into  space, i  carried  a  number  of  things  up  with  me. I   carried  a  poster  by  alvin  ailey, which  you  can  figure  out.
And  yeah, Sub-atomic  physics  is  Deconstructive. You  literally  try  to  tear  atoms  apart  to  understand  What's  inside  of  them, but  sculpture  from  what  i  understand  from  great  Sculptors  is  Deconstructive  because  you  see  a  piece  and  you  remove  what  Doesn't  need  to  be  there.
It's  the  universe  as  experienced  by  everyone  and  the  arts  manifest  our  desire, our  attempt  to  share  or  influence  others  through  experiences. That  are  peculiar  to  us  as  individuals.
Do  you  know  these  books  these  such  and  such  for  dummies  
But  i  was  looking  online  at  Amazoncom  for  other  books, like  this  
There's  a  sort  of  business  model  around  being  stupid  in  some  sense, 
I  was  in  milan  last  week  for  the  italian  launch  
So  it  was  Traumatizing  actually  
Modernism  means  white  box  and  It's  a  perfect  white  box.
I  have  a  default  title  as  a  father  of  a  bunch  of  daughters  
As  a  child, we  used  to  wake  up  at  1  am  and  work  till  6  Pm, six  days  a  week.
Thank  you  
But  the  media  lab  is  an  interesting  place  and  It's  important  to  me, because  as  a  student, i  was  a  computer  science  undergrad. And  i  discovered  design  later  on  in  my  life.
And  there  was  this  person: muriel  cooper  
It  was  the  best  advice  i  ever  got.
I  think  that  the  mentors  that  we  all  meet  sort  of  humanize  us, 
So  if  you  sort  of  compare  that  like  this  You'll  see  that  computer  versus  human  --  I've  been  tracking  this  for  the  last  year  --  computer  versus  human  over  the  last  year  has  changed  
I  spent  my  entire  early  career  making  complex  stuff  
Lots  of  complex  stuff, 
This  is  a  floral  theme  calendar  in  1997. And  this  is  a  Firework  calendar.
I've  been  lucky  to  have  been  there  before  people  made  these  kind  of  things. And  so  i  made  all  this  kind  of  stuff  that  messes  with  your  eyes.
And  eye  meat  is  something  different  something  more  Fibrous, something  more  powerful, perhaps, but  what  could  that  be  eye  meat?
So  i  went  back  to  the  computer  and  i  bought  five, large  fries  and  scanned  them  all.
And  also, as  a  child, i  was  the  Fattest  kid  in  class. So  i  used  to  love  cheetos. Oh, i  love  cheetos.
I  discovered  that  cheetos  are  good.
It's  a  strange  business  model, i  can  come  into  work  everyday  and  staple, five  pieces  of  paper, and  just  stare  at  it  with  my  latte.
In  japan, they  say  that  sushi  is  challenging  .
This  book  i  wrote  because  i  want  to  figure  out  life  
He's  an  expert  in  aging. This  horizontal  axis  is  how  old  you  are  --  twelve  years  old. Twenty-four  years  old, Seventy-four, Ninety-six  years  old  --  and  this  is  some  medical  data. So  brain  strength  increases  up  to  60. And  then  after  60, it  sort  of  goes  down, kind  of  depressing  in  a  way.
Your  social  responsibility  is  very  interesting  
How  dare  we  be  optimistic  
But  as  important  as  it  is  to  change  the  Lightbulbs, it  is  more  important  to  change  the  laws.
And  there  are  lots  of  those, but  the  climate  crisis  is  the  rare, but  all-important  global  or  strategic  conflict.
Greenland  remains  Twenty-eight  years  ago. This  is  what  the  polar  ice  cap  --  the  north  polar  ice  cap  --  looked  like  at  the  end  of  the  summer  at  the  fall.
This  last  fall, i  went  to  the  snow  and  ice  data  center  in  boulder, colorado  and  talked  to  the  researchers  here  in  monterey  at  the  naval, Postgraduate  laboratory  
The  north  polar  ice  cap  is  the  same  size, geographically  --  Doesn't, look  quite  the  same  size  --  but  it  is  exactly  the  same  size  as  the  united  states, minus  an  area, roughly  equal  to  the  state  of  arizona  
They  have  exactly  the  same  amount  of  carbon  
What  is  missing  is  a  sense  of  urgency, 
Nbc  --  I'll  show  all  of  the  networks  here  --  the  top  journalists  for  nbc  asked, 956  questions  in  2007  of  the  presidential  candidates. Two  of  them  were  about  the  climate  crisis.
This  is  gasoline  consumption  in  all  of  these  countries  and  us  
We  have  the  technologies  
We  have  to  have  a  unified  view  of  how  to  go  about  this, the  struggle  against  poverty  in  the  world, and  the  challenge  of  cutting  wealthy  country  emissions. All  has  a  single  very  simple  solution.
But  responses  can  actually  make  a  huge  difference  in  the  poor  countries. This  is  a  proposal  that  has  been  talked  about  a  lot  in  europe.
Lot  of  other  things  contributed  to  it. But  the  new  prime  minister  announced  that  his  very  first  priority  would  be  to  change  Australia's  position  on  kyoto.
But  we  have  a  planetary  emergency  
If  we  had  just  one  Week's  worth  of  what  we  spend  on  the  iraq  war, we  could  be  well  on  the  way  to  solving  this  challenge  
This  challenge  is  part  of  the  fabric  of  our  whole  civilization.
Demand  --  change  the  light  bulbs, but  change  the  laws  change.
Now, nobody  is  talking  on  that  scale, but  i  do  believe  that  between  now  and  november, it  is  possible.
In  terms  of  your  own  personal  role  going  forward. Al  is  there  something  more  than  that?
Al  gore: thank  you  so  much  for  coming  to  ted  
And  That's  certainly  how  it  seemed  to  me  when  i  started  this  project, 
All  this  noise  around  us  actually  has  information  
So  what  i  started  thinking  was, perhaps  there  is  something  like  open  source  intelligence.
So  we  started  doing  this, and  you  can  see  here  on  the  horizontal  axis, You've  got  the  number  of  people  killed  in  an  attack  or  the  size  of  the  attack.
You  take  all  of  the  conflict, all  of  the  chaos, all  of  the  noise. And  out  of  that  comes  this  precise  mathematical  distribution  of  the  way  attacks  are  ordered  in  this  conflict.
And  we  found  that  not  only  were  the  distributions  these  straight  lines.
And  we  could  generate  an  equation  that  could  predict  the  likelihood  of  an  attack  
This  is  data  statistics. What  does  it  tell  us  about  these  conflicts?
Turns  out  we  kind  of  do  a  reasonable  job  
So  What's  going  on  
Why  should  these  different  --  seemingly  different  conflicts  have  the  same  patterns?
What  does  it  look  like?
We  can  push  it  up? The  forces  become  more  fragmented. There  is  more  of  them, but  they  are  weaker.
The  opposite  happened.
The  groups  became  stronger  
But  designers  are  great  at  taking  big  revolutions  that  happen  and  transforming  them, so  that  we  can  use  them  
You  work  over  different  time  zones  you  talk  to  very  different  people, you  Multitask, we  all  know  it.
And  all  of  a  sudden  scientists  are  seeking  designers, just  like  designers  are  seeking  scientists  
And  keith  has  come  and  also, jonathan  has  come  and  many  others.
And  it  was  great  because  at  the  beginning  was  this  Apology  Fest  --  you  know, scientists  would  tell  designers, you  know, i  Don't  know  what  style  is  I'm, not  really  elegant  
Paul  Steinhardt, a  physicist  from  new  york  and  Aranda/lasch  architects, collaborated  in  an  installation  in  london  at  the  serpentine  
I'm  showing  to  you  different  sections  of  the  show  right  now, just  to  give  you  a  taste  of  it.
In  this  case, I'm  showing  more  the  Designers'  work  because  They're  the  ones  that  have  really  been  stimulated  
But  the  problem  is  that  It's  a  really  ugly  Patty  
When  you  Don't  have  to  kill  cows  and  it  can  have  any  shape, what  should  it  be  like?
One  of  the  most  important  topics  of  the  show  --  you  know, as  anything  in  our  life  today  we  can  look  at  it  from  many, many  different  viewpoints  and  at  different  levels.
One  of  the  most  interesting  and  most  important  concepts  is  the  idea  of  scale. We  change  scale  very  often. We  change  resolution  of  screens  and  We're, not  really  Fazed  by  it.
You  can  be  in  the  subway, and  you  can  be  completely  isolated  and  have  your  own  room  in  your  ipod.
Again, this  communal  sense  of  experience  that  seems  to  be  so  important  today  
And  so  this  student  at  the  rca  designed  this  beautiful  Blown-glass  object, where  the  bees  move  from  one  chamber  to  the  other, if  they  detect  that  particular  smell, that  Signifies  in  this  case, pregnancy  
Design  for  debate  is  a  very  interesting  new  endeavor  that  designers  have  really  shaped  for  themselves.
And  usually  they  are  accompanied  by  videos.
It's  quite  amazing, how  these  things  can  make  you  smile  can  make  you  laugh  can  make.
Thank  you  very  much  
The  only  trouble  is  the  people  next  door. I   Can't  stand  them.
And  yet, if  i  just  allowed  myself  to  be  overwhelmed  by  these  feelings, i  Wouldn't  be  doing  my  job  --  because  i  have  to  actually  be  there  for  them  and  make  sure  that  rituals  happen  that  Practicalities  are  seen  to  
Who  Cannot  be  touched  by  compassion, when  we  see  the  terrible  horrors  of  the  results  of  war  or  famine  or  earthquakes  or  Tsunamis  
And  of  course, you  Can't  do  that  unless  you  understand  yourself  a  bit  more  
Therefore  there  should  be  justice  throughout  the  world.
So  like  Snoopy, we  Can't  just  lie  there, and  think  great  thoughts  about  our  neighbors.
There  has  to  be  a  willingness  to  do  good  deeds. But  not, of  course, at  the  expense  of  our  own  sanity.
What  does  this  compassion  entail  
And  as  many  people  do  he  was  dozing  off  during  the  sermon  
And  he  rushed  home  and  after  the  sabbath, he  made  12  Loaves  of  bread, took  them  to  the  synagogue, went  into  the  synagogue  opened  the  ark  and  said, god, i  Don't  know  why  you  want  this  bread.
And  he  called  the  two  of  them  to  his  office  
You  mean, god  Didn't  want  my  bread  
And  the  rabbi  said, You've  misunderstood  me  
You've  misunderstood, totally.
Please  keep  your  seat  
Wrap  it  in  an  ace  Bandage, take  some  ibuprofen  for  a  week  or  two  and  That's, the  end  of  the  story  
How  can  the  nervous  system  get  this?
In  your  house  wires  run  in  the  wall  from  the  light  switch  to  a  junction  box  in  the  ceiling, and  from  the  junction  box  to  the  light  bulb.
It's  almost  as  if  somebody  came  into  your  home  and  Rewired  your  walls.
If  you  look  out  your  window  and  you  can  see  Long's  peak  You're, probably  familiar  with  it  
Take  Meeker  mt, Meeker  lump  that  in  there  and  put  that  in  space  as  well  and  mt.
Because  back  then  video  cameras  were  just  starting  to  become  popular, and  people  would  bring  them. Parents  would  bring  them  to  their  Kids'  football  games  to  film, their  kids, play  football.
This  did  a  huge  amount  of  damage  
The  one  over  tunguska  was  probably  made  of  rock  and  That's  much  more  Crumbly. So  it  blew  up  in  the  air  either  way.
I  Don't  think  apophis  is  a  problem  
In  fact, apophis  is  a  blessing  in  disguise  because  it  woke  us  up  to  the  dangers  of  these  things.
Well, let  me  ask  you  what  happens  if  You're  standing  in  the  middle  of  the  road  and  a  Car's  headed  for  you? What  do  you  do?
I  think  even  nasa  can  do  that, and  they  proved  that  they  can  
After  the  big  macho, Rrrrrrr, bam, We're  Gonna  hit  this  thing  in  the  face. Then  we  bring  in  the  velvet  gloves.
There's  a  group  of  scientists  and  engineers  and  astronauts, and  they  call  themselves  the  B612  foundation  for  those  of  you  Who've  read  the  little  prince, you  understand  that  reference. I   hope  the  little  prince  who  lived  on  an  asteroid.
So  think  about  this  right  
Now, those  of  you  who  are  lucky  enough  to  live  in  those  societies  that  represent  17  percent, i  think  should  enjoy  it  until  it  lasts  
My  story  starts  --  the  story  i  want  to  share  --  starts  in  1991  
The  problem  was  that  we  had  to  Re-tape  that  history  a  week  later, because  if  we  did  not, we  could  not  afford  enough  tapes  to  keep  archives  of  that  history.
So  here  we  are  having  our  first  client, brilliant, ,
It's  a  kind  of  very  nice  sophisticated  way  how  to  economically  Strangle, a  daily  newspaper, 
And  we  said, That's, fine, Let's, meet  You'll, bring  us  your  business  plan, which  eventually  they  did  
We  start  the  meeting  
But  however, you  put  it, you  know, the  numbers  do  not  make  any  sense.
We  were  the  best  that  they  could  do  
We  do  it  in  17  countries  of  the  developing  world  
So  what  the  governor  got  was  an  empty  shell  
So  from  that  perspective, what  we  did  is  just  really  one  drop  in  the  sea  of  that  need  that  we  can  identify  
Imagine  two  thirds  over  here  running  excellent  organizations  doing  very  important  work.
Now, imagine  that  every  second  person  over  here  is  deaf, does  not  hear  and  switch  the  lights  off  
So  we  thought  that  some  kind  of  a  big  idea  is  needed  to  reform  to  totally  rethink  fundraising  
And  then  two  weeks  later, Iqbal  Quadir  can  issue  his  electricity  in  bangladesh  bonds  
So  indeed, i  have  spent  my  life  looking  into  the  lives  of  presidents  who  are  no  longer  alive.
So  since  i  tell  stories, let  me  look  back  on  the  lives  of  two  of  the  presidents  I've, studied  to  illustrate  this  point  --  abraham  lincoln  and  lyndon  johnson  
But  he  read  books  in  every  spare  moment, he  could  find  
Three  things  had  combined  to  lay  him  low  
He  was  so  depressed  that  friends  worried.
And  his  great  friend  speed, went  to  his  side  and  said, lincoln, you  must  rally, or  you  will  die. .
And  with  a  beauty  of  language  --  almost  as  if  the  shakespeare  and  the  poetry  he  had  so  loved  as  a  child  had  worked  their  way  into  his  very  soul.
Knowing  that  tolstoy  was  in  their  midst, they  asked  him  to  tell  stories  of  the  great  men  of  history.
But  instead  surprisingly, he  said, oh, bring  her  down  here  for  a  year.
But  they  were  great  nonetheless, 
But  i  also  worried  that  part  of  it  was  that  i  was  then  a  young  woman  
And  there  was  wine  and  cheese  and  a  Red-checked  tablecloth  --  all  the  romantic  trappings  
And  the  british  people  were  still  upset  about  losing  the  revolution. So  they  decided  to  embarrass  him  a  little  bit  by  putting  a  huge  picture  of  general  washington  in  the  only  outhouse  where  He'd  have  to  encounter. It.
Which  allows  me  from  the  beginning  of  spring  training  to  the  end  of  the  fall  to  have  something  to  occupy  my  mind  and  heart  other  than  my  work.
But  it  so  happened.
So  i  went  to  my  father  in  tears, what  are  we  going  to  do  
I  tried  to  sandwich  it  in  between  talking  too  much  in  church, wishing  harm  to  others  being  mean  to  my  sisters, 
Well, Here's  an  example  from  my  own  experience, 
There  are  lots  of  people  who  believe  that. And  i  think  it  is  utter  baloney.
I  think  That's  the  main  point  to  be  made  
And  i  Won't  go  into  a  lot  of  stuff  about  quantum  mechanics  and  what  It's  like  and  so  on  
There  are  even  movies  about  it  with  a  lot  of  wrong  stuff.
And  in  a  lot  of  familiar  cases, they  of  course, are  
So  It's, not  a  theory  of  everything. And  in  fact, a  huge  amount  of  the  information  in  the  universe  around  us  comes  from  those  accidents  and  not  just  from  the  fundamental  laws.
You  know  what  it  means. A   circle, for  example, is  symmetric  under  rotations  about  the  center  of  the  circle.
Maxwell's  equations  are, of  course, symmetrical  under  rotations  of  all  of  space.
The  next  --  second  --  equation  says  that  there  is  no  magnetism  other  than  that.
So  here  we  say, again, what  we  said  before  that  each  skin  of  the  onion  shows  a  similarity  to  the  Adjoining  skins, 
And  therefore  it  looks  beautiful  because  we  already  know  how  to  write  it  in  a  lovely  Concise  way.
Steps  toward  unification, exhibit  the  simplicity  
Symmetry  exhibits  the  simplicity  
Now  who  today  would  claim  that  as  a  mere  conceit  of  the  human  mind, 
They  are  what  we  call  emergent  properties.
You  Don't  need  --  you  Don't  need  something  more  to  get  something  more  
Life  can  emerge  from  physics  and  chemistry, plus  a  lot  of  accidents, 
The  things  we  make  have  one  supreme  quality  --  they  live  longer  than  us.
We  perish  they  survive, we  have  one  life, they  have  many  lives. And  in  each  life, they  can  mean  different  things.
The  central  element, still  of  the  notion  of  return  a  central  part  of  the  life  of  judaism  
All  of  those  are  respected  by  cyrus, 
It  left  a  dream  of  the  middle  east  as  a  unit  and  a  unit  where  people  of  different  faiths  could  live  together.
For  them, of  course, it  Can't  possibly  by  marduk  that  made  all  this  happen.
And  It's  quite  clear, the  cylinder  is  older  than  the  text  of  isaiah.
The  state  of  israel  is  setup.
It's  shown  being  presented  here, put  into  its  case  by  the  director  of  the  national  museum  of  tehran.
And  It's  the  subject  of  a  huge  debate  about  what  this  cylinder  means  what  cyrus  means. But  above  all  cyrus  as  articulated  through  this  cylinder  --  cyrus, as  the  defender  of  the  homeland, the  champion  of  course  of  iranian  identity  and  of  the  iranian  peoples  tolerant  of  all  faiths.
Will  iran  set  free, the  people  that  the  Tyrants  have  enslaved  and  Expropriated  
A  replica  of  this  is  at  the  united  nations, 
But  i  think  It's  possible  that  the  most  powerful  and  the  Wisest  voice  of  all  of  them  may  well  be  the  voice  of  this  mute  thing.
Making  sense  of  those  things  is  a  very  difficult  thing  to  do  
In  fact, i  have  got  qualifications.
So  i  started  thinking  about  peace, and  i  was  obviously, as  i  said  to, you  very  much  moved  by  these  images, trying  to  make  sense  of  that  
Could  i  go  and  speak  to  older  and  wiser, people  who  would  tell  me  how  they  made  sense  of  the  things  that  are  going  on  
And  that  was  when  i  had  the  idea  
There  was  no  day  of  global  unity  
And  That's  why  we  wanted  it  to  be  the  21st  of  september  as  the  date  of  peace.
Could  you  give  me  a  flight  because  We're  going  to  go  see  him  
And  of  course, we  went  and  saw  him, and  it  was  amazing  
And  just  staying  in  the  moment  with  it  was  a  beautiful  thing, and  really  empowering  actually  
And  we  were  listening  to  everybody  
And  working  with  ngos  and  building  this  case, 
I  felt  that  i  was  presenting  a  case  on  behalf  of  the  global  community  to  try  and  create  this  day.
And  this  young  child  Who'd  taken  about  an  inch  and  a  half  out  of  her  leg  with  no  Antiseptic.
If  this  is  the  only  film  that  i  ever  make  I'm  going  to  document  until  this  becomes  a  reality  
The  costa  Rican  government  and  the  british  government  had  put  forward  to  the  united  nations, general  assembly  with  54  Co-sponsors, the  idea  of  the  first  ever  Ceasefire  nonviolence  day, the  21st  of  september  as  a  fixed  calendar  date. And  it  was  unanimously  adopted  by  every  head  of  state  in  the  world.
And  as  i  mentioned, when  it  started, we  were  at  the  globe, and  there  was  no  press  
It's  been  created, nobody  knows  
But  we  have  to  continue  this  journey, and  we  have  to  tell  people, and  we  have  to  prove  it  can  work.
And  after  lots  and  lots  of  meetings, obviously  I'm  delighted  that  this  man  Ahmad  Fawzi, one  of  my  heroes  and  mentors, really, he  managed  to  get  unicef  involved.
And  i  saw  him  because  he  was  an  actor. I   was  an  actor. I   had  a  connection  to  him  because  we  needed  to  get  to  the  press  we  needed. This  attraction, we  needed  the  media  to  be  involved.
Because  if  we  start  pumping  it  up  a  bit, maybe  more  people  would  listen  and  There'd  be  more  --  when  we  got  into  certain  areas, maybe  there  would  be  more  people, interested  
I  Won't  go  into  that  
So  jude  said, okay, I'll  do  some  statements  for  you  
And  i  could  sort  of  see  a  little  look  in  his  eye  of  interest.
So  these  guys  were  absolutely  crucial  
This  amazing  woman, Fatima  Gailani  was  absolutely  instrumental  in  what  went  on  as  she  was  the  Spokesperson  for  the  resistance  against  the  russians  
And  her  afghan  network  was  just  absolutely  everywhere.
We  will  observe  this  day  
We  see  it  as  a  window  of  opportunity.
And  so  then  we  wrapped  the  film  up  and  we  put  it  together  because  we  had  to  go  back  
And  we  wanted  to  go  back  and  show  them  the  film  and  say, look, you  guys  made  this  possible. And  thank  you  very  much.
And  i  kept  thinking  about  this  70  percent  
70  percent  reduction  in  violence  --  in  what  everyone  said  was  completely  impossible.
He's, an  amazing  man, 
It's  all  about  the  individuals, 
And  it  then  made  me  think  about  a  glass  of  water, which  is  clear  
Thank  you  very  much.
There  was  not  a  flashlight, not  a  Lantern, not  a  candle  --  pitch  black  
Anesthetic  wears  off  the  patient  feels  pain  
And  her  recommendation  is  take  this  opportunity  to  fire. Everyone  start  all  over  again.
Now, what  does  this  have  to  do  with  leadership?
They  are  the  elite, they  are  our  leaders.
And  we  need  to  train  them  right?
And  one  day  i  go  to  the  airport  to  meet  my  father, and  as  i  walk  up  this  grassy  slope  from  the  car  park  to  the  terminal  building  I'm  stopped  by  two  soldiers, wielding  ak-47  assault, weapons, 
So  a  few  years  after  this  event, i  leave  ghana  on  a  scholarship  to  go  to  swarthmore  college  for  my  education.
They  wanted  us  to  be  analytical, 
They  wanted  us  to  be  concerned  about  social  issues.
It  was  brilliant  
Somebody  trained  them  to  do  the  work  that  they  do  
Now  we  Cannot  achieve  perfection, but  if  we  reach  for  it, then  we  can  achieve  excellence.
I  Don't  know, ultimately  what  they  will  do  
But  the  conversation  They're  having  now  --  about  what  their  good  society  should  look  like  what  their  excellent  society  should  look  like, is  a  really  good  thing.
Now, i  just  wanted  to  leave  that  slide  up  because  It's  important  that  we  think  about  it.
I  am  even  more  thrilled  by  the  fact  that  least  year  our  student  body  elected  a  woman  to  be  the  head  of  student  government  
It's  the  first  time  in  the  history  of  ghana  that  a  woman  has  been  elected  head  of  student  government  at  any  university  
It  says, a  lot  about  her  peers  who  elected  her  
My  job  is  to  make  arms  and  legs  --  well, It's, not  completely  true  
And  then  not  only  for  war  victims, but  it  was  for  any  kind  of  patient  
I  was  also  working  in  the  orthopedic  center.
But  it  was  a  terrific  job.
So  the  orthopedic  center  was  closed, because  physical  rehabilitation  was  not  considered  a  priority  
Anyway, you  know  every  time  i  make  this  speech  --  It's, not  the  first  time  --  but  It's  an  emotion  
I  wanted  to  go  home.
And  everybody  disappeared  from  the  street  
The  man  was  without  legs  and  only  with  one  arm  
And  i  ask, what  are  you  doing  out  in  the  street  in  this  situation?
And  then  i  said, oh  my  god, what  did  i  say  
He  was  coming  every  day  crossing  the  front  line, 
Two  groups  of  Mujahideen  started  fighting  
So  we  Dashed  all  of  us  towards  the  shelter  
Everybody  was  grabbing  something  
And  i  will  never  forget  mahmoud  and  his  son, walking  together, pushing  the  empty  wheelchair  ,
I  Don't  want  them  to  be  Teased  at  school  by  the  other  students, 
I  said, okay, 
And  then  he  sat  down  
So  the  only  things  i  could  manage  to  obtain  was  a  kind  of  a  compromise  
I  understood  that  i  was  wrong  again, 
And  then  we  started  a  new  policy  --  a  new  policy  completely  different  
We  decided  to  employ  as  many  disabled  as  possible  to  train  them  in  any  possible  job.
I  said, no, no, no, no, we  Can't  
And  you  should  see  me  during  the  match  
I  shout  like  a  true, italian  
In  this  image  of  the  tokyo  skyline, I've  hidden  data  from  the  newest  Planet-hunting  space  telescope  on  the  block, the  kepler  mission  
There  we  go  
And  we  can  measure  this  very, very  precisely  with  kepler  and  trace  their  effects  
Wrong  I'm, not  looking  at  you.
I  have  to  do  something. Now, which  seems  a  little  bit  strange  for  a  magician.
Oh  they  Gladly  sell  you  that  yes, 
But  the  one  thing  that  has  made  a  big  Comeback, just  recently, is  this  business  of  speaking  with  the  dead  
I  Don't  think.
Good  bye  
The  second  question  that  I'd  like  to  ask  rather  simple, suppose  i  ask  them  to  contact  the  spirit  of  my  deceased  Father-in-law, as  an  example, 
Is  this  a  hunting  game  
But  it  is  a  cruel  vicious.
Folks  That's, what  dying  is  all  about  
Now, it  may  bring  a  certain  amount  of  comfort, but  that  comfort  lasts  only  about  20  minutes  or  so  
We  all  know  who  he  is  on  television  
He's  well, educated, He's  smart.
Because  the  bottom  line  is  the  sponsors  love  it, and  he  will  expose  her  to  television  publicity  all  the  time.
Now  without  that, how  could  we  possibly  function  
She  gives  you  the  names  of  previous  lives  who  you  were  in  previous  lives.
Duh  
Nothing  is  ever  said  about  a  14  year-old  Bootblack  in  the  streets  of  london  who  died  of  consumption.
All  the  more  reason  to  take  the  million  dollars  Wouldn't, you  think  sylvia  
Why  Don't  they  affect  me  
Now  folks, this  is  not  just  a  metaphor  I'm  going  to  give  you  now  It's.
And  another  claim  that  they  make  --  You'll  love  this  one  --  the  more  dilute, the  medicine  is, they  say, the  more  powerful.
Largely  It's, the  media  who  are  to  blame  for  this  sort  of  thing.
It's  the  bottom  line, the  dollar  line  
Now  We've  offered  this  carrot, as  i  say, We've  Dangled, the  carrot  
Ladies  and  gentlemen, I'm  james  randi  and  I'm, waiting  
And  one  of  the  major  gaps  in  care  almost  across  the  board  is  access  to  safe  surgery.
In  the  background, there  is  a  very  sophisticated  anesthesia  machine: 
In  order  to  operate  this  machine  needs  a  number  of  things  that  this  hospital  has  to  offer  
And  finally, i  think  you  can  see  that  infrastructure  is  not  very  strong  
Similarly, compressed  oxygen  and  other  medical  supplies  are  really  a  luxury  and  can  often  be  out  of  stock  for  months, or  even  a  year  
One  of  our  partners  at  johns  hopkins  was  observing  surgeries  in  sierra  leone  about  a  year  ago.
And  the  first  surgery  of  the  day  happened  to  be  an  Obstetrical  case, 
And  everything  began  pretty  Auspiciously  
My  colleague  dr, paul  Fenton  was  living  this  reality.
He  went  to  work  every  day  in  an  operating  theater, like  this  one  trying  to  deliver  anesthesia  and  teach  others  how  to  do.
But  this  gives  control  to  the  provider  whether  There's  power  or  not  because  they  can  adjust  the  flow  based  on  the  percentage  of  oxygen.
This  is  in  13  hospitals  in  four  countries, and  since  2010  We've  done  well  over  2000  surgeries  with  no  clinically  adverse  events, 
So  We're  thrilled, 
Because  only  once  before  has  the  fate  of  individual  people  and  the  fate  of  all  of  humanity  been  so  intertwined, 
Maybe  a  few  lung  diseases  here  and  there, but, you  know, That's  not  such  a  big  deal.
But  back  to  animals  and  junk  food, 
Two  both  have  been  marketed  heavily  creating  unnatural  demand  
And  they  do  this  here.
That's, just  the  united  states  
There  were  no  restaurant  chains.
Fats  carbs: proteins  --  they  Weren't  bad  or  good.
The  south  and  west  became  agricultural  hubs.
If  we  had  a  slide  of  Salisbury  steak, even  more  so  right  
Thanks  to  farm  subsidies, the  fine  collaboration  between  agribusiness  and  congress  soy  corn.
Not  that  they  were  any  good, but  they  were  there.
For  dessert  Store-bought  ice  cream  or  cookies  
So  now, You've  got  your  pizza  nights. You've  got  your  microwave  nights, You've  got  your  grazing  nights, You've  got  your  Fend-for-yourself  nights.
Meat  junk  food, cheese, the  very  stuff  that  will  kill  you  
So  now  we  Clamor  for  organic  food  
I  Don't  know, 
Ann  Cooper's, right  
The  usda  is  not  our  ally  here.
Cruelty, i  knew  that  the  10  billion  animals  we  raise  each  year  for  meat  are  raised  in  factory  farm  conditions  that  we  Hypocritically  Wouldn't, even  consider  for  our  own  cats  dogs  and  other  pets.
So, why  was  i  Stalling  
Best  of  all  I'm  healthier, i  know  that  I'm  going  to  live  longer  and  I've  even  lost  a  little  weight.
Thank  you  
Some  of  these  have  already  been  touched  upon  by  other  speakers, which  is  encouraging  ,
The  first  is  --  death  is  a  big  problem.
Sometimes  we  Don't  see  a  problem  because  either  It's  too  familiar  or  It's  too  big  
People  like  --  It's, roughly  the  population  in  this  room  has  just  died  
Suppose  we  Approximated  one  person  with  one  book, 
So  That's, the  first  big  problem, 
Well, Let's, first, look  at  the  probability  --  and  this  is  very, very  difficult  to  estimate  --  but  there  have  been  only  four  studies  on  this  in  recent  years, which  is  surprising  
He  estimated  a  probability  that  we  will  fail  to  survive  the  current  century, 50  percent  
Another  author  Doesn't  give  any  numerical  estimate, but  says, the  probability  is  significant  that  it  will  fail.
Now, if  we  think  about  what  just  reducing  the  probability  of  human  extinction, by  just  one  percentage  point  --  not  very  much  --  so  That's  equivalent  to  60  million  lives  saved  if  we  just  count, the  currently  living  people, the  current  generation  
The  only  thing  you  should  focus  on  would  be  to  reduce  existential  risk, because  even  the  tiniest  decrease  in  existential  risk  would  just  overwhelm  any  other  benefit.
And  even  if  you  just  look  at  the  current  people  and  ignore  the  potential  that  would  be  lost, if  we  went  extinct, it  should  still  have  a  high  priority  
We  were  very  successful  
We  might  end  up  with  something  like  this, which  is  --  i  mean, It's  a  heck  of  a  lot  better  than  that  
And  they  also  all  seem  a  little  bit  --  most  people  have  this  instinct  that  well  sure  there  needs  to  be  anti-depressants  for  the  really  depressed.
Intellectual  capacity  --  Let's  take  that  box, which  falls  into  a  lot  of  different  Sub-categories, memory  concentration, mental  energy, intelligence, empathy, ,
Able  to  switch  back  and  forth, more  easily  would  be  a  neat  thing  to  be  able  to  do  --  easier  to  achieve  the  flow  state  when  You're  totally  immersed  in  something  you  are  doing  .
If  you  could  actually  choose  to  preserve  your  romantic  Attachments  to  one  person  Undiminished  through  time, so  that  Wouldn't  have  to  --  love  would  never  have  to  fade  if  you  Didn't  want  it  to  
Might  be  more  complicated  in  humans, but  perhaps  not  that  much  
Well, we  know  already  that  in  this  little  human  circle, there  there  are  these  enormously  wonderful  and  worthwhile  modes  of  being  --  human  life  at  its  best  is  wonderful  
We  have  no  reason  to  believe  that  within  this  much  much  larger  space, there  would  not  also  be  extremely  worthwhile  modes  of  being  perhaps  ones  that  would  be  way  beyond  our  wildest  ability, even  to  imagine  or  dream  about  
And  so  to  fix  this  third  problem, i  think  we  need  --  slowly  carefully  with  ethical  wisdom  and  constraint  --  develop  the  means  that  enable  us  to  go  out  in  this  larger  space  and  explore  it  and  find  the  great  values  that  might  hide  there.
The  sun  end  was  about  four  inches  in  diameter, and  then  it  Tapered  over  about  35  feet  to  about  a  millimeter  at  the  earth, end  
So  i  got  it  down  to  just  one  tether  to  be  able  to  support  that  
So  many  forces  there  
If  i  throw  a  very  concentric  circle  or  concentric  ellipse, it  just  dutifully  makes  these  evenly  spaced  lines  which  get  closer  and  closer  together, which  describes  how  gravity  works.
Because  since  it  has  the  ability  to  make  forms  that  look  like  forms  that  We're  familiar  with  in  biology, It's  also  making  other  forms  that  We're  not  familiar  with  
Oh  Let's  hope.
And  i  think  nature  wants  to  express  itself  in  the  sense  that  we  are  nature. Humans  are  of  the  universe.
And  we  are  expressions  of  the  universe, basically, 
As  humans, ultimately, being  part  of  the  universe, We're  kind  of  the  Spokespeople  or  the  observer  part  of  the  constituency  of  the  universe.
And  to  interface  with  it  with  a  device  that  lets  these  forces  that  are  everywhere  act  and  show  what  they  can  do, giving  them  Pigment  and  paint, just  like  an  artist  It's, a  good, ally  ,
It's  become  an  art  form, a  form  of  sculpture, 
But  even  more  importantly, he  created  a  language  a  way  we  could  communicate  a  code  of  dots, Dashes  and  arrows.
This  is  an  origami  figure  --  one  sheet, no  cuts, folding  only  hundreds  of  folds  
This  too  is  origami.
You  can  get  horns  Antlers  --  even  if  you  look  close  Cloven, hooves  
And  what  changed  is  something  you  might  not  have  expected  in  an  art, which  is  math  
I  mean, a  Stag  beetle  --  It's  got  two  points  for  jaws  It's  got  antennae. Can  you  be  that  specific  in  the  detail?
If  i  make  the  flaps  Skinnier, i  can  use  a  bit  less  paper.
And  i  can  use  those  patterns  now  to  create  origami  shapes, 
Do  a  little  more  complicated  instrument, 
And  he  used  it  to  design  this  solar  array  
The  telescope  going  up  in  space, it  unfolds  in  two  places.
The  design  called  for  Geosynchronous  orbit, 25000  miles  up, 100-meter  diameter, lens, 
And  rockets  are  small.
But  this  Pattern's  not  going  to  work  to  get  something  100  meters  down  to  a  few  meters  
And  they  want  to  do  their  design  by  simulation  
And  as  weird  and  surprising  as  it  may  sound, origami  may  someday  even  save  a  life  
Now, ecstasy  in  greek  meant  simply  to  stand  to  the  side  of  something  
You  Can't  understand  more  than  two  people  talking  to  you  
And  it  has  become  a  kind  of  a  Truism  in  the  study  of  creativity  that  you  Can't  be  creating  anything  with  less  than  10  years  of  Technical-knowledge  immersion  in  a  particular  field  
Whether  It's  mathematics  or  music, it  takes  that  long  to  be  able  to  begin  to  change  something  in  a  way  that  It's  better  than  what  was  there  before.
You  see  that  these  people  define  success  as  something  that  helps  others  and  at  the  same  time  makes  you  feel  happy  as  you  are  working  at  it.
The  other  combinations  of  challenge  and  skill  become  progressively, less  optimal, 
And  that  is  the  kind  of  challenge  that  We're  trying  to  understand  
Not  a  lot  of  women  did  
The  '20s  and  the  '60s  also  come  to  mind  
This  is  really  just  about  the  facts  of  this  economic  moment  that  we  live  in  
This  second  set  of  headlines  --  you  can  see  that  families  and  marriages  are  starting  to  shift  
And  so  they  decided  because  they  were  intrigued  by  this  finding  to  do  a  nationwide  survey  
So  they  spread  out  all  the  census  data. And  what  they  found  the  guy  described  to  me  as  a  shocker, which  is  that  in  1997  out  of  2000  communities, women  young  women  were  making  more  money  than  young  men.
Watch  what  happens  to  the  women?
It  looks  like  women  got  some  power  boost  on  a  video  game, or  like  they  snuck  in  some  secret  serum  into  their  Birth-control  pills  that  lets  them  shoot  up  high  
What  It's  about  is  that  the  economy  has  changed  a  lot.
So  That's  childcare  elder  care  and  food  preparation  
And  some  people  say  It's  because  in  9th  grade, boys  start  dropping  out  of  school  
Basically  the  way  they  said  it  to  me  is  that  they  would  be  working  18  hours  a  day  that  their  husband  would  maybe  have  a  job.
And  this  was  kind  of  a  shocker  to  me  
They  basically  enshrined  the  Second-class  status  of  women  in  the  civil  code.
For  one  thing, it  puts  men  and  women  in  a  really  Antagonistic  relationship  with  one  another, because  the  men  are  these  Devious  Tricksters  up. There.
So  the  image  that  i  like  to  think  of  instead  of  glass  ceiling  is  the  high  bridge  
There's, no  man  or  woman  standing  in  the  middle  about  to  cut  the  cables  
To  the  dismay  of  my  mother, this  is  dangerous  teenage  fashion, right?
Really  make  a  fully  integrated  product, something  beautiful  
This  baby  is  fully  electric  
All  the  projections  [say  That], this  one  [billion]  will  [only]  grow  with  one  to  two  or  three  percent.
[but  this  Second]  grows  with  seven  eight  percent. And  then  they  will  end  up  here.
They  will  start  flying  
Because  we  already  have  this  [growth]  in  process, 
The  year  is  1960  
Can  you  see  as  the  years  pass  by  child  survival  is  increasing  
It's  only  by  child  survival  that  we  will  stop  population  growth.
In  the  front, you  see  actually  joe  murray  getting  the  patient  ready  for  the  transplant  while  in  the  back  room, you  see  Hartwell  Harrison, the  chief  of  Urology  at  harvard  actually  harvesting  the  kidney  
That  really  has  to  do  with  our  aging  population  
It's  not  really  that  foreign  of  a  concept.
So  your  body  is  constantly  Regenerating  
So, how  can  we  harness  that  power  
That's  exactly  what  you  see  here.
To  the  naked  eye, they  look  like  a  piece  of  your  blouse  or  your  shirt.
It  Disintegrates, a  few  months  later, 
What  about  other  structures  
This  is  actually  an  engineered  blood  vessel  
You  now  have  your  fully  seeded  scaffold  
We  then  take  a  scaffold  that  we  shape  like  a  bladder  
We  place  it  back  into  this  oven-like  device.
So  bladders  are  definitely  a  little  bit  more  complex  than  the  other  structures.
But  there  are  other  hollow  organs  that  have  added  complexity  to  it  
We  exercise  these  prior  to  Implantation  
All  we  are  left  with  is  the  skeleton.
This  is  still  experimental, but  we  are  able  to  actually  reproduce  the  functionality  of  the  liver  structure.
So  another  strategy  We're  following  is  actually  to  create  Wafers  that  we  stack  together  like  an  Accordion.
If  at  all  possible, we  really  would  like  to  use  smart  biomaterials, that  we  can  just  take  off  the  shelf  and  regenerate  your  organs.
Why  because  We'd  rather  take  those  cells, which  already  know  that  those  are  the  cell  types, you  want  
And  we  prefer  cells  that  will  not  reject  and  will  not  form  tumors.
And  We're  working  a  lot  with  the  stem  cells  that  we  published  on  two  years  ago, stem  cells  from  the  Amniotic  fluid  and  the  placenta, which  have  those  properties.
So  i  always  like  to  show  this  cartoon  
And  there  you  see  the  Stagecoach  driver, and  he  goes  on  the  top  panel.
Entrepreneurs  are  people  --  because  we  have  a  lot  of  them  in  this  room  --  who  have  these  ideas.
And  as  a  young  kid, nobody  can  say  it  Can't  happen  because  You're  too  dumb  to  realize  that  you  Couldn't  figure  it  out  
If  we  can  teach  our  kids  to  become  entrepreneurial  --  the  ones  that  show  those  traits  to  be  --  like, we  teach  the  ones  who  have  science  gifts  to  go  on  in  science. What  if  we  saw  the  ones  who  had  entrepreneurial  traits  and  taught  them  to  be  entrepreneurs?
We  could  actually  have  all  these  kids  spreading  businesses, instead  of  waiting  for  government  handouts, 
And  the  media  says  that  It's  really  cool, if  we  could  go  out  and  be  a  model  or  a  singer  or  a  sports  hero, like  Luongo, Crosby  
Our  mba  programs  do  not  teach  kids  to  be  entrepreneurs.
We  Didn't  fit  in  the  normal  work. We  Couldn't  work  for  somebody  else  because  We're  too  stubborn. And  we  have  all  these  other  traits.
I  could  go  on  and  on  
Fit  into  this  other  system, and  try  to  become  a  student  
I'm  also  quoted  --  and  i  told  the  person  who  wrote  the  textbook  --  I'm  now  quoted  in  that  exact  same  university  textbook  in  every  canadian  university  and  college  studies  
I  open  up  chapter  eight  talking  about  Budgeting  
And  i  told  the  author  after  they  did  my  interview  that  i  cheated  in  that, same  course, 
And  my  mom  came  into  the  room, and  she  said, where  are  you  going  to  get  the  coat  hangers  to  sell  to  the  dry  cleaners?
I'm  like, but  you  have  two  cars, and  they  Don't  have  license  plate  protectors  
So  i  knew  there  were  two  cars  with  two  license  plates  on  each  
But  it  was  obvious  to  me  right?
Don't  try  to  sell  to  the  poor  kids. They  Don't  have  cash.
So  That's  obvious, right, 
And  making  money  off  that  too  
I  built  these  little  Pincushions  when  i  was  11  years  old  in  cubs, and  we  made  these  pin  cushions  for  our  moms  for  Mother's  day.
And  You'd  make  these  chairs  
You  get  the  golf  balls  and  you  just  throw  them  in  your  bathing  suit  trunks.
And  they  could  use  those  for  practice  balls.
But  it  paid  the  bills  
I  remember  being  told  to  walk  out  in  the  middle  of  a  street  in  Banff  alberta  because  I'd  thrown  a  penny  out  in  the  street. And  my  dad  said, go  pick  it  up.
But  then  we  negotiate  on  what  They're  going  to  get  paid  
You  breed  that  kind  of  stuff.
The  50  percent  that  goes  in  their  house  account, every  six  months  goes  to  the  bank  
Just  do  that  kind  of  stuff  and  have  fun  with  it.
We  have  all  these  lessons  in  front  of  us, but  we  Don't  take  those  opportunities. We  teach  kids  to  go  get  a  tutor.
My  kids  love, this  stuff, 
It's  a  video  that  was  done  by  one  of  the  companies  that  i  mentor  
They  were  trying  to  figure  out  how  to  rebuild  their  universities.
Since  education, under  the  soviet  union  was  essentially  propaganda, serving  the  purposes  of  a  state  ideology.
You  may  think  you  know  what  is  going  on  in  that  jane  austen  novel  --  that  is  until  your  first  encounter  with  postmodern  Deconstructionism  
When  the  astronomical  distance  between  the  realities  of  the  academy  and  the  visionary  intensity  of  this  challenge  were  more  than  enough, i  can  assure  you  to  give  one  pause, what  was  happening  outside  higher  education  made  backing  off  unthinkable.
And  that  was  only  the  beginning  
Incredibly  this  nation  with  all  its  material, intellectual  and  spiritual  resources  seems  utterly  helpless  to  reverse  the  Freefall  in  any  of  these  areas.
We  are  playing  with  fire, 
On  a  more  personal  note, this  betrayal  of  our  principles, our  Decency, our  hope  made  it  impossible  for  me  to  avoid  the  question. What  will  i  say  years  from? Now, when  people  ask  'where  were  You'  as  president  of  a  leading  liberal  arts  college  famous  for  its  innovative  history, there  were  no  excuses.
The  challenge  to  figure  out  what  it  will  take  to  actually  do  something  that  makes  a  significant  and  sustainable  difference.
Even  more  valuable  history  provides  a  laboratory  in  which  we  see  played  out  the  actual  as  well  as  the  intended  consequences  of  ideas.
Students  in  turn  continuously, move  outside  the  classroom  to  engage  the  world  directly.
This  is  a  political  education  to  be  sure  
The  center  will  embody  and  sustain  this  new, educational  commitment, 
What  is  certain  is  that  the  individual  talent  exhibited  in  such  abundance  here  needs  to  turn  its  attention  to  that  collaborative  messy  frustrating, contentious  and  impossible  world  of  politics  and  public  policy  
All  right, okay, so  perfect  
They  go  to  church  by  which  i  mean, they  do  lots  of  things  for  free  for  each  other  
Now, i  know  you  Don't, believe  me, really  here  
He's  a  terrible  producer  of  videos, but  It's  great  content.
So  here  he  is  beginning.
This  is  this  fantastic  brat  pack  remix  set  to  Lisztomania  
They  decided  they  wanted  to  do  the  same  
So, That's  importantly, different  from  the  earlier  videos, we  looked  at  because  here  remix  Isn't, just  about  an  individual  doing  something  alone  in  his  basement. It  becomes  an  act  of  social  creativity.
Indeed, Mickey  mouse  himself. Of  course, as  Steamboat.
He  is  the  celebration  and  ideal  of  exactly  this  kind  of  creativity.
But  then  the  company  passes  through  this  dark  stage  to  this  democrat  
Okay, for  a  second  example, think  about  this  cultural  hero  icon  on  the  left  creator  of  this  character, 
Look  at  the  site  that  he  built  star: wars: Mashups, inviting  people  to  come  and  use  their  creative  energy  to  produce  a  new  generation  of  attention  towards  this  extraordinarily  important  cultural  icon, 
So  the  point  is  the  republicans  here  recognize  that  There's  a  certain  need  of  ownership, a  respect  for  ownership, the  respect  we  should  give  the  creator, the  Remixer, the  owner, the  property  owner, the  copyright  owner  of  this, extraordinarily  powerful  stuff  and  not  a  generation  of  Sharecroppers  
Now, i  think  there  are  lessons  we  should  learn  here  lessons  about  openness.
Our  lives  are  sharing  activities, at  least  in  part.
That's  number  one: number  two: this  ecology  of  sharing  needs  freedom  within  which  to  create  
And  number  three, we  need  to  respect  the  creator.
These  tools  that  we  built  enable  this  sharing  in  parts  through  licenses  that  make  it  clear  and  a  freedom  to  create  without  requiring  permission  first, because  the  permission  has  already  been  granted  and  a  respect  for  the  creator, because  it  builds  upon  a  copyright.
And  it  explains  the  vast  right-wing  conspiracy  That's, obviously  developed  around  these  licenses  as  now  more  than  350  million  digital  objects  are  out  there  licensed  freely  in  this  way.
Now  if  we  can  learn  those  values  from  at  least  some  influences  on  the  right, if  we  can  take  them  and  incorporate  them, maybe  we  could  do  a  little  trade.
In  fact, someone  on  reddit  thought, oh  what  a  great  thing  we  should  all  vote.
And  that  was  that  the  internet  loves, mister  splashy  pants  
They  even  created  an  E-card, so  you  could  send  your  friend, a  dancing  splashy  
There  are  so  many  great  publishing  tools  that  are  available. It  only  takes  a  few  minutes  of  your  time.
If  you  want  to  succeed, You've  got  to  be  okay  to  just  lose  control.
Well, we  all  know  the  world  wide  web  has  absolutely  transformed  publishing  broadcasting, commerce  and  social  connectivity.
Vannevar  bush  was  the  us  Government's  chief  scientific  adviser  during  the  war.
And  the  memex  would  link  information  one  piece  of  information  to  a  related  piece  of  information  and  so  forth.
He  built  a  system  
And  we  delivered  the  World's  first  hypertext  system  
They  had  a  12-page  supplement  in  the  wall  street  journal  the  day  it  launched  
I  thought, well, you  know, interesting, but  a  guy  from  cern, He's  not  going  to  do  this  
In  1992, his  paper  was  rejected  for  the  hypertext  conference.
Secondly, for  the  first  time, in  the  modern  era, the  dominant  country  in  the  world  --  which  i  think  is  what  china  will  become  --  will  be  not  from  the  west, and  from  very, very  different  civilizational  roots  
Now, i  know  It's  a  widespread  assumption  in  the  west  that  as  countries  Modernize, they  also  Westernize  
It  will  remain  in  very  fundamental  respects, very  different  
In  other  words, china, unlike  the  western  states, and  most  countries  in  the  world  is  shaped  by  its  sense  of  civilization, its  existence  as  a  civilization-state, rather  than  as  a  nation-state.
Well, basically  the  east  was  swallowed  by  the  west  
Hence, their  attitude, for  example, to  the  Uyghurs  and  to  the  Tibetans  
This  is  the  chinese  view  of  the  state  --  very, very  different  to  ours  
Know  that  china  believes  in  the  market  and  the  state  
Moreover, this  is  a  very  old  state  tradition, a  very  old  tradition  of  Statecraft  
And  yet  we  still  insist  by  and  large  in  thinking  that  we  can  understand  china  by  simply  drawing  on  western  experience, looking  at  it  through  western  eyes, using  western  concepts  
But  It's, not  
Whereas  those  cultures  --  virtually  the  rest  of  the  world, in  fact, which  have  been  in  a  far  weaker  position  vis-a-vis  the  west  --  have  been, thereby  forced  to  understand  the  west  because  of  the  West's  presence  in  those  societies.
Because  What's  happening  back  to  that  chart  at  the  beginning, the  goldman  sachs  chart  
Europe  was  not  at  the  final  negotiating  table.
Well, maybe  That's  true, maybe  That's, an  exaggeration  
But  There's, another  problem, which  goes  along  with  this  --  that  europe  is  increasingly  out  of  touch  with  the  world  --  and  that  is  a  sort  of  loss  of  a  sense  of  the  future.
Or  take  this.
Accelerometers, on  each  hand, read  hand, position, 
And  he  was  very  impressed, he  was  all  tearing  up  ready  to  hug  me.
I  must  have  done  about  30000  Caricatures  
That  evening, i  came  home  to  hundreds  of  hate  Mails  hundreds  of  people  telling  me  how  they  could  have  lived  another  day  without  seeing  this  
I  was  also  asked  to  leave  the  organization  a  Cartoonists'  organization  in  america  that  for  me, was  my  Lifeline  
And  all  of  a  sudden, my  paintings  came  alive, 
The  collaborative  effort  was  fabulous  
Since  i  mentioned, my  wife, the  most  important  collaboration  has  been  with  her.
I  must  have  been  19  and  a  half  then, and  it  was  love  at  first  sight.
I  lived  in  india, she  lived  in  america.
Notice, one  thing  We're  equal  here, 
We  had  fashion  designers  installation  artists  models, we  had  makeup  artists, jewelry, designers, all  kinds  of  people  working  with  me  to  make  my  wedding, an  art  installation  
And  i  had  a  special  installation  in  tribute  to  my  In-laws  
I  could  not  live  this  larger  than  life  person.
This  time, i  said, Let's, try  something  different  
And  this  was  just  eight  months  ago, 
I  walk  into  her  room, and  there  was  a  shy  girl, and  she  was  bald, and  she  was  trying  to  hide  her  baldness  
I  whipped  out  my  pen, and  i  started  drawing  on  her  head, and  i  drew  a  crown  for  her  
Our  computers, our  systems  will  be  as  primitive  as  the  Apollo's  are  for  today.
We  can  develop  any  part  of  the  body  
The  other  major  development  is  going  to  be  in  the  area  of  what  can  happen  in  genetics.
This  would  imply  a  massive  leap  in  migration, 
An  individual  for  the  first  time  in  the  history  of  humanity  will  have  the  capacity  by  2030  to  destroy  the  planet  to  wreck  everything  through  the  creation, for  example, of  a  Biopathogen  
More  people  smaller  spaces, less  stuff.
For  example, i  want  to  use  zipcar  
And  so  from  a  branding  perspective, they  got  a  lot  right  
Platforms  are  invitations.
So  creating  craigslist  or  itunes  and  the  iphone  developer  network, there  are  all  these  networks  --  facebook  as  well.
Essentially  there  are  all  sorts  of  restaurants  in  oakland  near  where  i  live  
And  one  quick  example  is  Velib  in  2007, came  forward  in  paris  with  a  very  bold  proposition: a  very  big  Bike-sharing  service, 
We're  at  the  very  beginning  of  something  that  what  We're  seeing  and  the  way  that  mesh  companies  are  coming  forward  is  inviting  It's, engaging, but  It's  very  early  
You  have  to  make  a  wish  to  save  the  world  
I  mean, i  Can't  save  the  world.
I  know  those  guys  
It  was  the  only  one  i  had  at  that  time.
They  were  making  scary  faces  to  play  the  Caricature  of  themselves.
So  we  decided  to  take  portraits  of  palestinians  and  israelis  doing  the  same  jobs  --  Taxi-driver  lawyer, cooks, 
The  experts  said, no  way, 
We  said, okay, Let's  try  and  push  as  far  as  we  can  
Okay, for  example, That's  palestine, 
Three  kids  --  that  was  three  students  --  were  [detained]  by  the  army  because  they  were  not  carrying  their  papers.
We  need  culture  out  there.
You  see  that  enough  in  the  media  
What  i  want  to  show  is  the  incredible  life  
During  that  time, you  Haven't  thought  about  what  You're  going  to  eat  tomorrow.
When  you  look  at  kibera, now  they  look  back  
So  we  could  just  walk  in  the  street  during  the  next  days, and  the  photos  would  get  revealed  by  themselves.
So  we  Didn't  get  caught  this  time.
Hopefully  You'll  see  the  film  and  You'll  understand  the  scope  of  the  project.
Because  That's  a  big  part  of  it  There's  layers  behind  each  photo, 
But  tell  me  advertising  for  what  
The  people  i  photograph  were  proud  to  participate  in  the  project, and  to  have  their  photo  in  the  community  
The  importance  is  what  you  do  with  the  images, the  statement  it  makes  where  It's  pasted  
This  image  of  three  men  wearing  gas  masks  was  taken  in  chernobyl  originally, and  i  pasted  it  in  southern  italy  where  the  mafia  sometimes  bury  the  garbage  under  the  ground  
So  a  subject  You're  passionate  about  a  person  who  you  want  to  tell  their  story, or  even  your  own  photos  --  tell  me  what  you  stand  for  
Einstein's, especially  interested  in  Penelope's, talk  
A  lot  of  her  research  goes  on  in  caves, which  can  get  pretty  dusty  
Well, That's  really  cool.
That  is  one  big  peanut  since  einstein  is  a  bird  She's, very  interested  in  things  that  fly  
E: [spaceship, Noise]  sw: even  if  it  Doesn't  have  a  laser  
E, [squawks]  sw: yeah, it  sure  can.
Or  maybe  sirena  Huang  would  like  to  learn  some  arias  on  her  violin, and  einstein  can  sing  along  with  some  opera  
E: [operatic.
Or  maybe  Stu  just  needs  another  backup, singer, 
You  like  to  drink  water, 
Again, 
E: Ooooowww!
E: goodbye!
And  about  five  years  ago  we  asked, what  was  the  most  important  need  for  innovation  in  schooling  here  in  the  uk, 
The  minister  of  education  down  south  in  london  described  himself  as  a  big  fan  
They're, not  like  all  of  you  who  can  sit  in  rows.
I  would  run  into  the  living  room  jump  up  on  the  couch, rip, the  cushions  off, throw  them  on  the  floor, scream  at  the  top  of  my  lungs  and  run  out. Because  i  was  the  incredible  hulk.
And  i  would  like  to  share  my  art  
So  moving, onward  
First  principles: this  is  very  important  
I  tried  Kickboards  
Hand, paddles, everything  
Kicking  harder, Doesn't  solve  the  problem. Because  the  average  swimmer  only  transfers  about  three  percent  of  their  energy  expenditure  into  forward. Motion.
So  Let's  look  at  some  examples.
Rather  he  is  entering  the  water  at  a  45-degree  angle  with  his  forearm  and  then  Propelling  himself  by  Streamlining  --  very  important  
Below  is  what  most  Swimmers  will  find  enables  them  to  do  what  i  did, which  is  going  from  21  strokes  per  20-yard  length  to  11  strokes  in  two  Workouts  with  no  coach, no  video  monitoring  
In  freestyle, easiest  way  to  remedy. This  is  to  turn  with  body  roll.
Then  i  transferred  to  a  different  school  sophomore  year, and  i  had  a  choice  of  other  languages.
I  Couldn't  believe  i  was  on  the  other  side  of  the  world.
And  a  teacher  came  up  to  me  and  handed  me  a  piece  of  paper  
And  That's  pretty  much  my  response  
Nothing  worked  until  i  found  this  
Many  of  the  publications  in  japan  limit  themselves  to  these  characters  to  facilitate  literacy  --  some  are  required  to  
And  now  i  love  languages  
I  was  so  concerned  with  her  perception  of  what  i  was  doing  that  it  exploded  in  my  face. Never  to  return  to  the  ballroom  dancing  club.
Everyone  burst  into  laughter.
So  i  had  a  very  short  deadline  for  a  competition.
These  seemed  to  be  the  three  areas  that  i  could  exploit  to  compete. If  i  wanted  to  Comptete  against  people  Who'd  been  practicing  for  20  to  30  years.
That  photo  is  of  the  Semi-finals  of  the  buenos  aires  championships.
Then  one  month  later, went  to  the  world  championships  made  it  to  the  Semi-final  and  then  set  a  world  record  following  that  two  weeks  later, 
So  he  can  lift  the  woman  to  break  her, for  example, 
There  are  many  different  types.
I  have  hundreds  of  hours  of  footage  --  all  categorized  much  like  george  Carlin  categorized  his  comedy  
So  fear  is  your  friend  fear  is  an  indicator  
Especially  with  fears, you  gained  when  you  were  a  child  
And  if  any  of  you  are  interested  in  that, i  would  love  to  speak  with  you  
But  i  ask  a  lot  of  questions  and  i  would  love  your  advice  
It's  written  using  wiki  software  --  which  is  the  type  of  software. He  just  demonstrated  --  so  anyone  can  quickly  edit  and  save. And  it  goes  live  on  the  internet. Immediately.
So  when  yochai  is  talking  about  new  methods  of  organization, He's  exactly  describing  wikipedia  and  what  I'm  going  to  do  today  is  tell  you  a  little  bit  more  about  how  it  really  works  on  the  inside  
And  so  if  you  think  about  what  that  means, it  means  a  lot  more  than  just  building  a  cool  website.
And  so  That's  a  big  part  of  why  We've  chosen  the  free  licensing  model  because  that  empowers  local  entrepreneurs  --  or  anyone  who  wants  to  can  take  our  content  and  do  anything  they  like  with  it  --  you  can  copy  it  redistribute  it, and  you  can  do  it  commercially  or  Non-commercially  
The  biggest  languages  are  german  japanese  french  --  all  the  western  european  languages  are  quite  big  
So  the  big  question, when  You've  got  this  really  chaotic  organization  is  why  Isn't  it  all  rubbish.
The  actual  truth  about  the  specific  bush-kerry  incident  is  that  the  bush-kerry  articles  were  locked  less  than  one  percent  of  the  time  in  2004, and  it  Wasn't  because  they  were  contentious, it  was  just  because  there  was  routine  Vandalism  --  which  happens  sometimes  even  on  stage  people  --  sometimes  even  reporters  have  reported  to  me  that  they  Vandalize  wikipedia  and  were  amazed  that  it  was  fixed.
So  the  biggest  and  the  most  important  thing  is  our  neutral  Point-of-view  policy  
If  you  engage  in  that  type  of  behavior  You'll  be  asked  to  leave  the  community  
And  then  users  can  set  up  their  own  personal  watch  list.
So  my  page  is  on  quite  a  few  Volunteers'  watch  lists  because  it  is  sometimes  Vandalized  
And  That's, a  really  important  thing  to  understand  is  that  the  vast  majority  of  the  edits  that  go  on  on  the  website  are  from  a  very  close-knit  community  of  maybe  600  to  1000  people  who  are  in  constant  communication.
Another  thing  that  we  do  within  the  community  is  we  leave  everything  very  open-ended  
I  give  this  talk  sometimes  with  Angela, who  was  just  Re-elected  to  the  board  from  the  community  --  to  the  board  of  the  foundation  with  more  than  twice  the  votes  of  the  person  who  Didn't  make  it  
Of  course, the  vote  ended  up  being  about  85  to  18. So  there  was  no  real  danger  to  our  democratic  processes.
It  strikes  me  that  much  of  the  textbooks  that  are  used  to  educate  our  children  are  inherently  biased  
Have  you  found  wikipedia  being  used  by  teachers  and  how  do  you  see  wikipedia  changing  education?
It  builds  on  the  storyline  of  bloggers  versus  newspapers.
I  sent  it  from  my  harvard  email  address.
And  so  the  wiki  books  project  is  an  effort  to  do  that  
In  the  jungles  of  guatemala, in  tikal  stands  a  temple  
His  name  was  Jasaw, Chan, K'awiil, 
He  lived  into  his  80s, and  he  was  buried  beneath  this  monument  in  720  ad  
They've, never  found  a  society  that  did  not  have  it  
It  was  told  by  an  anonymous  Kwakiutl  indian  of  southern  alaska  to  a  missionary  in  1896.
It's  below  your  emotions, 
It  comes  from  a  david  Mamet  play  and  There's, two, con  artists  in  the  play.
So  what  have  i  learned  from  this  experiment  that  i  would  like  to  tell  the  world  
Too  old  too  young, too  Scruffy, too  stupid, and  they  Won't  do  it  
And  in  fact, sometimes  i  feel  a  little  sorry  for  the  chicken  on  my  dinner  plate, when  i  think  of  how  intense  this  brain  system  is  
And  so  I've  spent  the  last  three  years  on  this  
And  so  There's, one  thing  that  makes  me  pursue  my  understanding  of  human  nature.

So  this  is  called  tembererana  
It's  based  on  an  Argentinian  rhythm, called  Carnivalito  
Yves  uses  his  body  to  steer  the  wing

And  his  equipment  as  well  
How  did  you  start  to  become  jetman?
And  That's, the  nearest  thing  to  the  dream  
When  i  exit  full  of  kerosene  I'm  about  55  kilos  
For  example, last  winter, i  began  with  kite  surfing  --  so  new  things  
Because  this  is  --  I'm  quite  an  experienced  manager  of  systems  as  a  pilot. But  this  is  really  --  you  need  fluidity. You  need  to  be  agile, and  also  to  adapt  really  fast.
So  i  was  at  my  minimum  altitude  in  that  vector  --  fast  --  so  i  pulled  that  
Exactly  there  is  a  rescue  parachute  for  the  wing  for  two  reasons. So  i  can  repair  it  afterward.
This  is  risky  stuff.
I  assume  you  have  standards, 
Let's  not  tell  you  employer  
Have  you  ever  seen  tandem  birds  
It  seems  a  little  bit  crazy, but  It's, not  
Thanks  to  the  increasing  technology, better  technology, it  will  be  safe  
They  wished  they  knew  how  to  prevent  their  food  supply  from  sometimes  failing  and  how  they  could  rest  when  they  were  tired  without  risking  starvation, be  warmer  cooler  safer  in  less  pain, 
But  they  failed  almost  completely  to  make  any  
Discoveries  like  fire  happened.
Within  40  years  physicists, discovered  the  whole  explanation  expressed  as  usual  in  elegant, symbols  
But  that  ability  to  make  progress  remained  almost  unused  until  the  event  that  revolutionized  the  human  condition  and  changed  the  universe.
But  that  Can't  be  what  made  the  difference  
And  that  rarely  if  ever  caused  anything  like  the  scientific  revolution, 
At  the  time, what  they  thought  distinguished  science  was  a  radical  idea  about  things  unseen  known  as  empiricism  
In  what  language  certainly  not  the  language  of  mathematics  in  which  galileo  rightly  said, the  book  of  nature  is  written  
By  the  way, why  Don't  we  do  that  
We  Don't  see  those  nuclear  reactions  in  stars, 
Some  rocks  and  some  Finches  
What  we  see  in  all  these  cases  bears  no  resemblance  to  the  reality  that  we  conclude  is  responsible  --  only  a  long  chain  of  theoretical  reasoning  and  interpretation  connects  them  
That  myth  is  testable  
It's, equally, testable  
The  search  for  Hard-to-vary  explanations  is  the  origin  of  all  progress.

There  are  just  way  too  few  eye  care.

But  this  glacier  Caved  into  the  water  and  a  seal  got  on  it  
They're  going  to  get  to  land  
But  unfortunately, 95  percent  of  the  glaciers  in  the  arctic  are  also  receding  right  now  to  the  point  that  the  ice  is  ending  up  on  land  and  not  injecting  any  ice  back  into  the  ecosystem.
These  Ringed  seals  also  live  out  their  entire  life  cycle  associated  and  connected  to  sea  ice.
Here's  me  in  my  office, 
After  an  hour  in  these  conditions  It's  so  extreme  that, when  i  go  down  almost  every  dive, i  Vomit  into  my  regulator  because  my  body  Can't  deal  with  the  stress  of  the  cold  on  my  head

When  I'm  on  my  deathbed  I'm  going  to  remember  one  story  more  than  any  other  
As  a  species  as  humans, we  like  to  say  penguins  are  really  cute, therefore  leopard  seals  eat  them.
It  just  sees  this  big  balloon  in  the  ocean  --  it  Doesn't  have  hands  --  It's  going  to  take  a  little  bite, the  boat  pops  and  off.
I'm  with  my  swedish  assistant  and  guide  
It's  time  for  you  to  get  in  the  water  
Why  else  would  she  release  these  penguins  at  me?
Because  she  Can't  believe, i  Can't  eat  this  penguin  
She's  about  to  let  me  know  She's  too  frustrated  with  me, 
What  had  happened  was  another  seal  had  snuck  in  behind  me, and  she  did  that  to  threat  display.
And  I'm  so  passionate  about  it  
They  go  to  see  Michelangelo's  david. And  when  they  finally  come  face  to  face  with  the  statue, they  both  freeze  dead  in  their  tracks.
If  you  know  about  this  trait, you  can  understand  a  lot  of  puzzles  about  human  behavior.
When  the  liberal  team  loses  as  it  did  in  2004  and  as  it  almost  did  in  2000, we  comfort  ourselves  
Developmental  psychology  has  shown  that  kids  come  into  the  world  already  knowing  so  much  about  the  physical  and  social  worlds  and  programmed  to  make  it  really  easy  for  them  to  learn  certain  things  and  hard  to  learn  others.
Here  are  the  results  
So, as  you  see  people  care  about  harm  and  care  issues, 
You  picked  a  particular  breed, you  learned  some  new  information  about  the  breed  
In  the  first  panel, we  see  the  moment  of  creation, 
It  shoots  up, and  it  keeps  going  up  
I  think  That's, probably  right, although  this  is  a  controversial  issue  
It's  just  a  lot  of  rock, and  then  a  lot  of  water  and  wind  and  a  lot  of  time, and  you  get  the  grand  canyon  
So  liberals  speak  for  the  weak  and  oppressed  
You  have  the  markings  of  Shiva  on  the  right  Shiva's, the  liberal  god, and  they  work  together  
But  as  we  learned  from  Samantha  power  in  her  story, about  sergio  vieira  de  mello, you  Can't  just  go  charging  in  saying, You're  wrong  and  I'm, right  
If  australia  had  to  send  a  thousand  people  tomorrow  to  west  papua, for  example, we  Don't  have  a  thousand  police  officers  hanging  around  that  could  just  go  tomorrow.
So  when  we  have  to  send  someone  we  send  the  military  --  because  They're  there  They're  available  and  heck  They're  used  to  going  off  and  doing  these  things  and  living  by  themselves  and  not  having  all  this  extra  support  
One  particular  thing  That's  come  up  that  i  am  especially  interested. In  is  the  question  of  whether  when  We're  sending  military  personnel  to  do  these  sorts  of  jobs, we  ought  to  be  Equipping  them  differently.
Military  personnel  are  being  trained  for  war. So  They're  trained  that, as  soon  as  things  go  bad, their  first  response  is  lethal  force.
And  of  course, being  australian  i  started  looking  at  stuff  in  australia, knowing  again  from  my  own  experience, about  various  times  when  non-lethal  weapons  have  been  introduced  in  australia, 
This  is  something  they  can  use  instead  of  a  Firearm  in  those  situations  where  they  would  have  previously  had  to  shoot  someone  
This  was  something  explicitly  introduced  to  be  an  alternative  to  Firearms, but  It's  being  routinely  used  to  deal  with  a  whole  range  of  other  sorts  of  problems.
Now, one  of  the  particular  issues  that  comes  up  with  military  use  of  non-lethal  weapons  --  and  people  when  They're  actually  saying, well, hey, there  might  be  some  problems  --  There's  a  couple  of  particular  problems  that  get  focused  on  
You  have  to  be  careful  about  who  You're  shooting  at  
They  were  holding  something  like  700.
And  It's, no  surprise  that  people  died  because  you  Don't  know  how  much  of  this  gas  each  person  is  going  to  inhale  what  position  They're  going  to  fall  in  when  they  become  unconscious.
The  person  Who's  spraying  the  Oc  spray  is  wearing  a  rubber  glove  to  make  sure  they  Don't  get  contaminated.
Just  in  case, you  think  It's  only  going  to  happen  in  the  united  states. It  happened  in  canada  as  well.
And  a  colleague  of  mine  sent  me  this  one  from  london  
I  looked  at  it, i  was  really  surprised  
So  if  you  have  these  problems  with  police  officers  with  non-lethal  weapons, what  on  earth  would  make, you  think  It's  going  to  be  better  with  military  personnel, 
What  would  these  guys  have  done  if  They'd  had  access  to  Tasers  or  to  a  manned  portable  version  of  the  active  denial  system  --  a  small  heat  ray  that  you  can  use  on  people  and  not  worry  about  it?
And  here  He'll  explain  a  little  bit  about  what  it  does  
And  i  found  this  old  video  
With  our  strengths  and  our  minds  and  spirit, we  gather  we  form  and  we  fashion  
This  particular  Reel  --  It's, an  industrial  video  --  but  it  was  shown  in  Drive-in  theaters  in  1961  --  in  the  detroit  area, in  fact  --  and  it  Preceded  alfred  Hitchcock's  psycho  
And  when  i  sat  down  next  to  him, he  was  telling  me  about  a  company  he  formed, and  he  was  building  some  robots  for  automobile  factories  to  move  things  around  on  the  factory  floor.
Now, the  other  thing  that  i  think  is  taking  off, another  reason  making  is  taking  off  today  is  There's  some  great  new  tools  out  there.
So  They're  the  brains  of  maker  projects  and  Here's  an  example  of  one  
These  guys  came  up  with  a  kit  version  for  750  dollars, and  that  means  that  hobbyists  and  ordinary  folks  can  get  a  hold  of  this  and  begin  playing  with  3d  printers  
Isn't  that  cool  
Well, he  did  a  little  bit  better  than  free  
So  we  all  think  we  know  what  glamour  is  here.
It's  glamorous  movie  stars  like  Marlene, dietrich  
Fantastic  glamorous  pictures  of  steel  mills  and  paper  mills  and  all  kinds  of  glamorous  industrial  places: 
You  had  a  glamour  
There  is  a  process  of  Idealization  Glorification  and  Dramatization  and  It's, not  just  the  case  for  people.
Glamour  Doesn't  have  to  be  people  
It  puts  you  into  this  special  special  world.
She's, not  looking  away  from  you  exactly, but  you  have  to  mentally  imagine  her  world  
She's  encouraging  you  to  contemplate  this  higher  world  to  which  she  belongs  where  she  can  be  completely  Tranquil, while  holding  the  iron  instruments  of  her  death  by  torture, 
This  sort  of  Streamlining  styling  is  not  just  glamorous  because  we  associate  it  with  movies  of  that  period.
To  conceal  all  art  and  make  whatever  is  done  or  said, appear  to  be  without  effort. And  this  is  one  of  the  critical  aspects  of  glamour.
But  if  you  look  in  a  catalog  --  particularly  a  catalog  of  modern  beautiful  objects  for  your  home  --  it  looks  like  this  
Part  of  the  thing  is  that  in  rear  window, the  question  is, is  she  too  glamorous  to  live  in  his  world?
And  the  answer  is  no.
So  this  Session's  supposed  to  be  about  pure  pleasure, but  Glamour's, really  partly  about  meaning, 
The  perfect  love  life  --  symbolized  by  the  perfect  necklace. The  perfect  diamond  ring.
This  is  an  interior  design  firm  that  is  literally  called  utopia.
But  There's  a  kind  of  wonder  in  the  stuff  that  gets  edited  away  in  the  cords  of  life.
David  Hockney  talks  about  how  the  appreciation  of  this  very  glamorous  painting  is  heightened. If  you  think  about  the  fact  that  it  takes  two  weeks  to  paint  this  splash, which  only  took  a  fraction  of  a  second  to  happen.
But  i  also  knew  how  hard  they  worked  all  week.
But  as  a  scientist, I'm  interested  in  a  different  problem  of  other  minds, and  that  is  the  one  I'm  going  to  introduce  to  you  today.
And  then  finally, to  show  that  some  of  the  differences  between  people  in  how  we  judge  others  can  be  explained  by  differences  in  this  brain  system  
Child, what  rs  pirates  really  like  cheese  sandwiches?
This  pirate  is  called  joshua  
Now, I'm  going  to  show  you  a  three-year-old  who  got  the  same  puzzle.
So  the  three-year-old  does  two  things  differently.
And  second, when  he  sees  ivan, taking  the  sandwich  where  he  left  his  where  we  would  say, He's  taking  that  one  because  he  thinks  It's  his  the  three-year-old  comes  up  with  another  explanation, He's  not  taking  his  own  sandwich, because  he  Doesn't  want  it.
So  That's, why  He's  taking  the  other  sandwich  
And  we  can  see  the  Continuation  of  this  process  of  learning  to  think  about  other  People's  thoughts  by  Upping, the  ante  and  asking  children  now  not  for  an  action  prediction, but  for  a  moral  judgment  
Remember  the  five-year-old  completely  understood  why  ivan  took  Joshua's  sandwich  
Was  ivan  being  mean  and  naughty  for  taking  Joshua's  sandwich, 
He  says, the  wind  should  get  in  trouble  for  switching  the  sandwiches.
And  so  what  we  wanted  to  know  was  could  differences  among  adults  in  how  they  think  about  other  People's  thoughts, be  explained  in  terms  of  differences  in  this  brain  region, 
And  her  friend  drinks  the  coffee  and  is  fine  
And  what  you  can  see  is  on  the  left  when  there  was  very  little  activity  in  this  brain  region, people  paid  little  attention  to  her  innocent  belief  and  said, she  deserved  a  lot  of  blame  for  the  accident.
First  I'm  going  to  show  you  that  this  is  a  magnetic  pulse.
I'm  going  to  show  you  what  happens  when  you  put  a  quarter  on  the  machine, 
But  in  the  case  of  a  failed  attempt  to  harm  where  grace  thought  that  it  was  poison, although  it  was  really  sugar  people. Now  say  it  was  more. Okay.
So  It's, not  a  Surreptitious  technology, 
So  I've  got  one  last  question.
Why  
Me  was  composed  of  stories  of  Cravings  of  Strivings  of  desires  of  the  future.
Me  only  existed  in  the  trying  
Babies  actually, Don't  come  out  of  your  mouth.
I  would  drive  it  and  demand  things  from  it.
I  Didn't  heed  it, no, i  organized  it, and  i  directed  it  
I  took  more  than  my  body  had  to  offer  
Cancer  exploded  the  wall  of  my  Disconnection  
Now  i  am  swimming  in  it.
So  we  brought  her  home, and  i  prayed  that  the  oil  Wouldn't  wash  up  on  her  beach  before  she  died.
And  i  said, but  What's, the  water  part  
It  was  my  whole  self  melting  into  Michaela's  lap.
It  was  finding  my  place  and  the  huge  responsibility  that  comes  with  connection.
It  was  energy  love  and  joy.
It  was  all  these  things.
Because  everyone  these  days  wants  to  know  how  to  slow  down, but  they  want  to  know  how  to  slow  down  really  quickly.
So  i  was  in  new  york  recently, and  i  walked  past  a  gym  that  had  an  advertisement  in  the  window  for  a  new  course, a  new, evening  course, 
You  know, a  Burnout, or  eventually, the  body  says, i  Can't  take  it  anymore  and  throws  in  the  towel.
Am  i  really  in  such  a  hurry  that  I'm  prepared  to  Fob  off  my  son  with  a  sound  Byte  at  the  end  of  the  day, 
I  just  thought, and  i  thought  long  and  hard  
And  by  the  time  i  got  off  that  plane, I'd  decided  i  wanted  to  do  something  about  it.
Time  is  scarce. So  what  do  we  do?
And  i  guess  that  the  question  is, is  it  possible  to  break  free  from  that  mindset?
And  in  this  kind  of  Cauldron  of  moments  and  places  and  acts  of  Deceleration  lie.
You  know, you  tap  into  that  --  those  deeper  sort  of  psychological  emotional  spiritual  currents, and  you  get  a  better  orgasm  with  the  Buildup  
I  mean, you  heard  that  i  got  a  speeding  ticket  while  i  was  researching  my  book  on  the  benefits  of  slowness  and  That's  true, but  That's, not  all  of  it.
I  think  There's  a  kind  of  metaphysical  dimension  --  that  speed  becomes  a  way  of  Walling  ourselves  off  from  the  bigger  deeper  questions.
We  fill  our  head  with  distraction  with  busyness, so  that  we  Don't  have  to  ask, am  i  well? Am  i  happy? Are  my  children  growing  up  right?
It's  become  my  reward  at  the  end  of  the  day, something  i  really  cherish  
I  was  downstairs  by  the  front  door, and  i  was  waiting  for  a  taxi, and  my  son  came  down  the  stairs  and  He'd  made  a  card  for  me.
So  what  I'd  like  to  talk  about  is  something  that  was  very  dear  to  Kahn's  heart, which  is, how  do  we  discover  what  is  really  particular  about  a  project  
This  used  to  be  an  island  --  Ackerman  island  --  and  we  filled  in  the  channel  during  the  depression  to  create  jobs  
And  Here's  the  building  as  it  opened  with  a  channel, overlooking  downtown, and  as  seen  from  downtown  ,
Every  piece  of  the  building  works  
I  was  very  moved  by  what  i  saw  today.
Let's  get  back  to  the  town  and  walk  to  the  site  
And  as  things  are  a  little  easier  in  india, the  site  was  purchased  within  a  week, and  we  were  working  
And  the  structures  rise  from  the  sand  cliffs  --  They're  built  in  concrete  and  Sandstones.
Back  to  Yad  Vashem  three  years  ago, after  all  this  episode  began, Yad  Vashem  decided  to  rebuild  completely  the  historic  museum.
They  said, Let's, rebuild  the  museum  
And  here  studying  in  three  dimensions, how  to  give  some  kind  again  of  order  a  structure, not  something  you  feel  you  could  just  change  because  you  stop  the  design  of  that  particular  process  
I'd  like  to  conclude  by  relating  all  of  what  I've  said  to  the  term, beauty  
We  call  a  natural  object, beautiful  because  we  see  that  its  form  expresses  fitness, the  perfect  fulfillment  of  function.
Nevertheless  beauty  as  the  kind  of  fit, something  that  tells  us  that  all  the  forces  that  have  to  do  with  our  natural  environment  have  been  fulfilled  --  and  our  human  environment  --  for  that  
He  who  seeks  truth  shall  find  beauty. He  who  seeks  beauty  shall  find  vanity.
He  who  considers  himself  the  servant  of  his  fellow  beings  shall  find  the  joy  of  self-expression. He  who  seeks  self-expression  shall  fall  into  the  pit  of  arrogance.
My  name  is  Kailash.
A  rising  tide  lifts  all  boats  
It  felt  like  it  was  really  important  
I  just  really  wanted  to  acknowledge  you  
It  is  really  a  sacred  space.
See  these  all  lie  right  inside  of  this  general  emotional  palette  that  we  were  painting  
The  only  way  that  i  would  say  it  was  a  mistake  is  in  that  we  Didn't  react  to  it  
It  was  an  opportunity  that  was  missed  .
So  It's  just  a  season, and  there  are  two  seasons  in  most  of  south  asia.
High  pressure  builds  over  india.
A  few  kilometers, maybe  is  quite  typical  
And  this  is  called  the  globe  Skimmer  or  wandering  glider  
But  it  really  Hasn't  been  studied, very  much  
It's  a  rather  mediocre, looking  dragonfly  
If  You're  going  to  study  dragonflies, you  want  to  study  those  really  bright  beautiful  ones  like  that  red  one  or  the  really  rare  ones.
And  they  were  there  for  some  time, and  then  they  were  gone  
And  i  Didn't  think  anything  more  of  it  until  the  following  year, when  it  happened  again  and  then  the  year  after  that, and  then  the  year  after  that  
And  on  top  of  the  coral  reefs  are  sand  banks, 
Those  of  you  who  are  indian  or  spent  your  childhood  here, let  me  have  a  show  of  hands  who  of  you  --  not  yet, not  yet  
So  are  these  things? How  are  these  things  getting  here?
It  stretches  about  500  miles, of  course, It's  india  here  
When  do  you  see  the  dragonflies  appear  
And  then  the  Southernmost, maldives, 
So  i  started  a  very  rigorous  scientific  process, 
It  Doesn't  make  sense.
And  We're  starting  in  june.
Nothing  for  these  dragonflies, there  is  no  more  seasonal  rain  
They're  looking  for  somewhere  to  breed.
They'll  hatch  out  in  six  weeks  by  that  time, the  seasonal  rains  have  moved  on  It's, not  there  It's  down  here.
They'll  fly  down  here.
So  the  little  fellow  that  Hatches  out  here  he  gets  up  into  the  air. He  is  automatically  carried  to  where  the  rain  is  falling.
So  in  four  generations, one  two  three  four  and  then  back  
A  complete  circuit  of  the  indian  ocean  
There  is  more  to  the  story.
Which  is  an  area  along  the  amur  river, which  is  up  here.
He's, an  engineer, 
Half  as  much  money  was  spent  on  this  norden  bombsight, as  was  spent  on  the  most  famous  military-industrial  project  of  the  modern  era.
It  allowed  you  to  bomb  only  those  things  that  you  absolutely  needed  and  wanted  to  bomb  
And  It's  carried  in  a  box  with  a  canvas  Shroud  over  it.
It's, never  allowed  to  be  photographed  
There  are  clouds  right?
The  Leuna  chemical  plant  after  one  of  the  most  extensive  bombings  in  the  history  of  the  war  was  up  and  running  within  weeks, 
So  i  would  like  to  invite  you  also  for  a  while  to  the  himalayas  themselves.
And  to  show  the  place  where  meditators  like  me  who  began  with  being  a  molecular  biologist  in  Pasteur  institute  and  found  their  way  to  the  mountains, 
I  just  wrote  an  essay  on  happiness, and  there  was  a  controversy.
As  pascal  said, even  the  one  who  hangs  himself  somehow  is  looking  for  cessation  of  suffering  --  he  finds  no  other  way.
Although  we  want  to  avoid  suffering, it  seems  we  are  running  somewhat  towards  it.
And  that  can  also  come  from  some  kind  of  Confusions  
It  is  something  that  --  changes  of  nature.
It  is  a  deep  sense  of  serenity  and  fulfillment  a  state  that  actually  Pervades  and  underlies  all  emotional  states  and  all  the  joys  and  sorrows  that  can  come  One's  way.
Can  we  have  this  kind  of  well-being  while  being  sad  in  a  way, why  not  
But  There's  also  wicked  joy, you  can  rejoice  in  Someone's  suffering, 
We  know  by  experience  that  we  can  be  what  we  call  a  little  paradise, and  yet  be  completely  unhappy  within  
The  experience  that  translates  everything  is  within  the  mind  
We  have  to  know  from  ourselves, there  are  certain  states  of  mind  that  are  conducive  to  this  flourishing  to  this  well-being.
Just  the  mere  fact  of  doing  that  fills  such  a  sense  of  Adequation  with  our  deep  nature, 
For  that  we  have  to  ask, what  is  nature  of  mind?
And  if  we  look  from  the  experiential  point  of  view, there  is  a  primary  quality  of  consciousness, That's, just  the  mere  fact  to  be  cognitive  to  be  aware.
Usually  when  we  feel  annoyed  hatred  or  upset  with  someone  or  obsessed  with  something, the  mind  goes  again.
But  we  think  we  could  sit  on  the  cloud  --  but  if  you  go  there, It's  just  mist  
Mind  transformation  --  that  is  the  very  meaning  of  meditation.
So  That's, what  those  great  meditators  have  been  doing  
If  you  are  happy  about  something  You'll  go  more  to  the  left  side, 
Here, the  -05  is  the  full  standard  Deviation  of  a  Meditator  who  Meditated  on  compassion  
So  I've, no  time  to  go  into  all  the  different  scientific  results.
Some  meditators  without  trying  to  stop  it. But  simply  by  being  completely  open  thinking  that  that  bang  is  just  going  to  be  just  a  small  event  like  a  shooting  star.
So  the  whole  point  of  that  is  not  sort  of  to  make  like  a  circus  thing  of  showing  exceptional  beings  who  can  jump  or  whatever  
We  are  ready  to  spend  15  years  achieving  education: 
I'm  not  going  to  show  you  a  presentation  I'm  going  to  talk  to  you  
The  thing  that  was  always  striking  to  me  was  that  we  as  people  could  have  so  many  really  amazing  ideas  about  things  We'd  like  to  do, but  are  so  often  unable  in  the  real  world  to  actually  do  those  things  --  to  actually  Cobble  together  the  materials  and  go  through  the  actual  execution  phase  of  building  something  that  you  imagine  from  a  design  perspective, 
It's  going  to  be  different  than  here.
To  give  you  an  idea  of  scale. Second  life  is  about  20000  Cpus  at  this  point.
And  let  me  justify  that  with  two  statements  
And  i  think  That's  something  that  people  have  talked  about  for  20  years  --  you  know  that  3d  that  lifelike  environments  are  really  important  in  some  magical  way  to  us  
Second  life  originally  had  16  simulators  it  now  has  20000  
And  we  had  --  we  Zoned  it, you  know, we  put  a  Nightclub, we  put  a  disco  where  you  could  dance. And  then  we  had  a  place  where  you  could  fight  with  guns. If  you  wanted  to.
And  so  the  existence  of  an  economy  is  critical  
The  question  is, there  appears  to  be  a  lack  of  cultural  Fine-tuning  in  second  life, 
And  so  the  multicultural  nature  and  the  sort  of  cultural  melting  pot  That's  happening  inside  second  life  is  quite  --  i  think, quite  remarkable  relative  to  what  in  real  human  terms  in  the  real  world, We've  ever  been  able  to  achieve  
Other  questions, right  here?
What's  your  demographic  
In  terms  of  Psychographic  --  oh  men  and  women, men  and  women  are  almost  equally  matched  in  second  life.
In  terms  of  Psychographic, you  know, the  people  in  second  life  are  remarkably  dissimilar  relative  to  what  you  might  think  when  you  go  in  and  talk  to  them  and  meet  them.
If  you  count, yeah, cities.
Yeah, so  let  me  Restate  that  
So  You're  saying  that  in  the  pamphlet  There's  a  statement  that  we  may  come  to  prefer  our  digital  selves  to  our  real  ones  --  our  more  malleable  or  manageable  digital  identities  to  our  real  identities  --  and  that, in  fact, much  of  human  life  and  human  experience  may  move  into  the  digital  realm.
That's, a  frightening  change, frightening  disruption  
I  guess  and  You're  asking, what  do  i  think  about  that?
(audience  if  someone  would  say  to  you, i  find  that  disturbing  what  would  be  your  Response)  pr.
Now, the  problem  of  human  diversity, like  all  big  scientific  questions  --  how  do  you  explain  something  like  that  --  can  be  broken  down  into  sub-questions?
What  We're  asking  about  though  is  human  ancestry, 
Digging  things  up  out  of  the  ground  and  largely  on  the  basis  of  morphology  --  the  way  things  are  shaped  often  skull  shape  --  saying, this  looks  a  little  bit  more  like  us  than  that.
You  think  You've  got  a  tough  job.
Now, a  quick  Primer  on  dna  
Mitochondrial  dna, tracing  a  purely  maternal  line  of  descent  
Turn  them  on  their  sides, combine  them  so  that  they  look  like  a  tree  with  the  root  at  the  bottom  and  the  branches  going  up  
Was  it  millions  of  years  ago, which  we  might  suspect  by  looking  at  all  this  incredible  variation  around  the  world  
Why  was  it  that  we  seem  to  have  come  out  of  africa?
What  was  going  on  to  the  World's  weather  around  60000  years  ago, 
The  reason  for  that  is  that  ice  actually  sucks  moisture  out  of  the  atmosphere  
Now  at  the  risk  of  Offending, any  Paleoanthropologists  or  physical  anthropologists  in  the  audience, basically, There's, not  a  lot  of  change  between  these  two  stone  tool  groups, 
Well, you  want  the  ultimate  african  success  story, 
Look  in  the  mirror, You're  it. The  reason  You're  alive  today  is  because  of  those  changes  in  our  brains  that  took  place  in  africa  --  probably  somewhere  in  the  region  where  We're  sitting  right  now  around  60, 70  thousand  years  ago  --  allowing  us  not  only  to  survive  in  africa. But  to  expand  out  of  africa.
These  would  have  been  savannah  hunters  
Entering  europe  around  35000  years  ago, and  finally, a  small  group  migrating  up  through  the  worst  weather  imaginable. Siberia  inside  the  arctic  circle, during  the  last  ice  age  --  temperature  was  at  -70  -80, even  -100, perhaps  --  migrating  into  the  americas.
The  changes  that  allowed  us  to  do  that.
The  field  research  that  We're  doing  around  the  world  with  indigenous  peoples  
The  human  genome  project  or  a  mars  rover  mission, 
In  this  case, you  actually  can  
And  You'll  now  see  the  yolk, and  the  white  have  separated  
And  we  all  know  in  our  heart  of  hearts  that  this  is  not  the  way. The  universe  works.
And  yet  look  around  us  
Now, we  move  forward  380000  years  
But  That's  not  completely  true  
Recent  studies  by  satellites, such  as  the  wmap  satellite, have  shown  that, in  fact, there  are  just  tiny  differences  in  that  background.
We  have  our  first  stars  
So  We've  crossed  a  fourth  threshold  of  complexity, 
So  it  copies  itself  and  Scatters  the  Templates  through  the  ocean  
And  That's, why  as  a  species  We're  so  creative  and  so  powerful  and  That's, why  we  have  a  history  
And  then, from  about  500  years  ago, humans  began  to  link  up  globally  through  shipping  through  trains, through  telegraph  through  the  internet, until  now  we  seem  to  form  a  single  global  brain  of  almost  seven  billion  individuals.
We've  been  on  a  journey, a  return  journey  of  137  billion  years.
And  It's  a  story  in  which  humans  play  an  astonishing  and  creative  role  
Collective  learning  is  a  very, very  powerful  force  and  It's, not  clear  that  we  humans  are  in  charge  of  it.
The  program  in  a  sense, is  an  example  of  behavioral  finance  on  steroids  --  how  we  could  really  use  behavioral  finance  
How  many  of  you  have  iphones  
And  That's  what  i  really  want  to  focus  on  today.
And  what  I'm  going  to  talk  about  today  is  save  more  tomorrow.
First  thing  to  notice  is  half  of  them  do  not  even  have  access  to  a  401  plan.
And  they  get  overwhelmed  and  the  just  Don't  join  
Suppose  we  had  another  wonderful  ted  event  next  week, 
The  same  people  that  imagined  themselves  eating  the  bananas  ended  up  eating  chocolates.
Self-control  is  not  a  problem  in  the  future.
Nobody  checks  boxes  
We're  going  to  talk  about  what  happens  if  people  are  overwhelmed  and  scared  to  make  their  401  choices, 
They're  really  mad  
We  first  implemented  it, richard  thaler  and  i  back  in  1998  
We  invited  them  to  save  three  percentage  points  more  every  time  they  get  a  pay, raise  
We're  seeing  here, a  three  and  a  Half-year  period, four  pay  raises  people  who  were  struggling  to  save  were  saving  three  percent  of  their  paycheck  three  and  a  half  years  later, saving  almost  four  times  as  much  almost  14  percent  
It's  been  part  of  the  pension  protection  act, 
The  average  household  spends  $4000  a  year  on  lottery  tickets.

This  song  is  called  fingertips.
This  is  eleanor  roosevelt  
Well, i  think  We're  going  to  stop  that  part  of  the  show  
Here's  a  song, we  like  to  think  of  as  the  future  anthem  of  ted  
And  the  third  said, Let's  find  another  director  
So  how  many  people  who  saw  the  film  did  not  get  that  here  was  a  woman  in  love  that  she  was  completely  innocent  and  saw  great  joy  in  her  life.
And  how  many  of  you  did  not  get  that  
It's  a  symbolic  gesture. I   tear  up  the  script  i  go.
Get  rid  of  your  mind  
In  delhi  we  used  to  live  --  we  used  to  call  it  a  Chhat  or  the  Khota  
And  i  Don't  know  why.
There  was  a  woodcutter  Who's  about  to  take  his  Ax  and  chop  a  piece  of  wood. And  the  whole  galaxy  is  one  atom  of  that  Ax.
And  when  that  Ax  hits  that  piece  of  wood  That's, when  everything  will  destroy  and  the  big  bang  will  happen  again, 
But  all  before  that, there  was  a  woodcutter  
So  every  time  i  could  tell  my  story  again  and  again  and  get  over  this  problem.
If  we  do  not  create  the  stories, we  probably  go  mad.
Are  you  with  child  
You  ask  my  permission  before  you  rut  before  you  breed  
Elizabeth, this  man  has  seduced  a  ward  of  the  queen, and  she  has  married  without  royal  consent.
Remember  the  word, i  said, suck  up  
But  i  can  go  on  about  telling  you  how  we  evolve  stories, and  how  stories  effectively  are  who  we  are  and  how  these  get  translated  into  the  particular  discipline  that  i  am  in  which  is  film.
We're  born  for  them, 
The  Children's  television  host  mr  rogers, always  carried  in  his  wallet, a  quote  from  a  social  worker  that  said, frankly, there  Isn't.
And  the  way  i  like  to  interpret  that  is  probably  the  greatest  story  commandment, which  is  make  me  care  --  please, emotionally  intellectually, Aesthetically  just  make  me  care.
And  so  if  i  were  going  to  give  you  the  ending  of  this  story, it  would  go  something  like  this  and  That's.
He  insisted, no  Embalming, no  open  coffin, no  funeral, 
It  Didn't  happen  to  me. It  happened  to  somebody  else, but  It's  going  to  be  worth  your  time.
♫  and  that  is  all  ♫  ♫  that  Love's  about  ♫  ♫  and  We'll  recall  ♫  ♫  when  time  runs  out  ♫  ♫  that  it  only  ♫  as  storytelling  without  dialogue, 
It  confirmed  something  i  really  had  a  hunch  on  is  that  the  audience  actually  wants  to  work  for  their  meal.
And  It's  something  that  always  drove  all  his  choices, 
Wall-e's  was  to  find  the  beauty  
Sometimes  you  can  make  some  horrible  choices  with  them  
But  a  major  threshold  is  passed  when  you  mature  enough  to  acknowledge  what  drives  you  and  to  take  the  wheel  and  steer  it  
And  That's, why  change  is  fundamental  in  story  
And  It's  interesting  to  see  how  that  led  us  places  that  were  actually  pretty  good  
And  we  got  a  hold  of  that  fax  
And  when  an  artist  does  that  to  another  artist  It's  like  You're, compelled  to  pass  it  on  ,
I  was  going  to  help  alleviate  poverty, 
We  paid  two  to  three  times  more  than  anybody  else.
We  may  have  some  innovative  new  ideas, 
There's  no  more  of  it  
This  is  where  we  stand  today.
And  then  we  need  to  use  less  again, 
Okay, so  Let's  be  generous  
How  do  you  evaluate  all  the  scientific  data  around  a  product, the  data  That's  changing  on  a  weekly  if  not  a  daily  basis, 
How  is  a  consumer  going  to  walk  through  this  Minefield  
These  are  the  15  commodities  that  fundamentally  pose  the  biggest  threats  to  these  places  because  of  deforestation  soil  loss, water  use  pesticide  use, Over-fishing, etc.
Are  we  going  to  work  with  15  billion  producers, 
If  we  work  with  those, if  we  change  those  companies  and  the  way  they  do  business, then  the  rest  will  happen  automatically.
Because  if  these  companies  demand  sustainable  products, They'll  pull  40  to  50  percent  of  production, 
By  companies  asking  for  this, we  can  leverage  production  so  much  faster  than  by  waiting  for  consumers  to  do  it.
After  40  years, the  global  organic  movement  has  achieved  07  of  one  percent  of  global  food.
We  Can't  wait  that  long  
We  need  change  That's  going  to  accelerate  
So  It's  the  demand  that  brings  them  to  the  table  
So  We're, pulling  out  all  the  stops  
They're  doing  it  with  ibm  and  the  usda  and  They're, putting  it  in  the  public  domain, because  they  want  everybody  to  have  access  to  this  data, because  they  want  everybody  to  help  them  make  cocoa  more  productive  and  more  sustainable.
If  you  divide  the  amount  of  water  into  what  the  farmer  was  paid, the  farmer  Didn't  receive  enough  money  to  pay  a  decent  price  for  water  in  any  of  those  commodities.
This  is  called  Bundling  It's, bringing  those  externalities  back  into  the  price  of  the  commodity  
We  Can't  just  focus  on  identifying  the  best  We've  got  to  move  the  rest  
And  I'm  honored  to  meet  you  the  future  leaders  of  great  britain.
And  my  mother, the  most  important  role  model  in  my  life  who  lives  with  us  at  the  white  house  and  helps  to  care  for  our  two  little  daughters, Malia  and  Sasha  
That's, why  all  of  this  that  You're  going  through  --  the  ups  and  the  downs, the  teachers  that  you  love  and  the  teachers  that  you  Don't  --  why  It's  so  important  
And  having  done.
I  liked  being  smart  
I  liked  being  on  time  i  liked  getting  my  work  done.
History  proves  that  it  Doesn't  matter, whether  you  come  from  a  council  estate  or  a  country  estate  
In  the  white  house, There's, the  desk  that  he  sits  at  --  It's  called  the  resolute  desk, 
She  is  a  world-class  soprano  singer  who  studied  in  Rochester  new  york  
For  me, the  human  voice  is  the  vessel  on  which  all  emotions  travel  --  except  perhaps  jealousy, 
When  You're  totally  in  the  moment, when  I'm  totally  in  the  moment, the  vessel  of  expression  is  open  
The  emotions  can  flow  from  me  to  you  and  back  
It's  called  aria  
For  example, there  are  different  colors, and  each  color  gets  a  different  type  of  singing  --  pop  country  and  western  opera  jazz  --  and  you  just  have  to  be  consistent  with  that  color  
They  had  one  great  limitation  and  one  great  freedom  as  they  tried  to  conceive  of  a  global  network.
So  unusual, in  fact, that  it  was  said  that  It's  not  clear, the  internet  could  work  
Now, of  course, in  a  Mosh  pit  It's  hard  to  Specify  a  destination  
This  is  a  system  that  relies  on  kindness  and  trust, which  also  makes  it  very  delicate  and  vulnerable.
So, for  example, last  year, the  government  of  pakistan  asked  its  internet  service  providers  there  to  prevent  citizens  of  pakistan  from  seeing  youtube  
And  here  is  the  message  where  one  of  them  says  looks  like  We've  got  a  live  one.
And  today, wikipedia  is  so  ubiquitous  that  you  can  now  find  it  on  chinese  restaurant, menus  
I  am  not  making  this  up  
And  there  are  a  bunch  of  people  who  on  a  sunny  day  would  rather  be  inside  and  monitoring  this  the  Administrator's  notice  board  itself  a  wiki  page  that  anyone  can  edit  
There  are  Spambots  crawling  it, trying  to  turn  every  article  into  an  ad  for  a  Rolex.
It's  something  they  feel  Impelled  to  do  because  they  care  about  it.
Here  is  just  a  snapshot  of  some  of  them.
If  you  do, it  will  be  removed  immediately  removed  by  people  who  may  have  Disagreed  with  the  original  decision, but  respect  the  outcome  and  work  to  make  it  stay  because  they  believe  in  something  bigger  than  their  own  opinion.
I  mean, this  is  a  2005  business  week  cover  
Yeah, i  know  number  four  It's, like, can  you  imagine  coming  home  to  that  cat  everyday?
This  one  says, Bucolic  meadow  with  Split-rail  fence, 
And  then  have  technology  that  the  person  taking  the  photo  will  know  later  this  person  Requested  to  be  contacted  before  this  goes  anywhere  big.
And  that  person  taking  the  photo  can  make  a  decision  about  how  and  whether  to  respect  it  
And  we  now  have  means  that  we  can  build  like  this  system, so  that  people  can  report  the  filtering  as  they  encounter.
Why  there  is  the  craigslist  Rideshare  board  
If  it  were  called  the  craigslist  hitchhiking  board, Tumbleweeds  would  be  blowing  through  it.
But  It's  the  Rideshare  board  and  It's, basically  the  same  thing.
It's  a  bee  that, yes, flies  
We  all  live  in  the  same  planet, but  There's  still  a  great  deal  of  poverty  in  the  world.
And  by  and  large, this  has  failed  
Aid  actually  did  the  opposite  
So  12  years  ago, i  was  trying  to  be  an  investment  banker  in  new  york  
And  it  reminded  me  of  a  day  in  1971  
And  after  all  poor  countries  like  rich  countries, one  thing  We've  got  equal  is  their  days  are  the  same  length, 24  hours  
The  question  was, how  much  did  it  cost  to  install  a  new  telephone  in  bangladesh  
It  turns  out  2000  dollars  
And  of  course, if  the  cost  of  installing  a  telephone  is  going  down  because  There's  a  digital  revolution  going  on, then  it  would  be  even  more  dramatic.
But  in  any  event, It's  connectivity, that  leads  to  Dependability  
There  were  a  lot  of  reasons  people  told  me  why  we  Don't  have  enough.
The  work  pays  them  a  salary, the  salary  allows  them  to  pay  for  the  car  over  time.
The  car  pays  for  itself  
See  you  need  some  kind  of  infrastructure  to  bring  a  new  thing.
For  instance, the  internet  was  booming  in  the  us.
And  she  sells  the  milk  to  the  villagers  and  pays  off  the  loan.
And  these  phones  are  generating  about  100  million  dollars  for  the  company.
It's  just  an  experiment  
I  was  a  guest  student  during  one  month  of  a  public.
They  read  the  textbook  twice  or  three  times  or  four  times  
And  they  were  the  first  to  twitter, Transatlantically  
Those  are  nice  words, but  i  got  sort  of  curious  of  what  he  meant  with  liberty  and  liberty  for  whom  
But  really, really  natural  sovereignty  was  good  for  japan  
In  1947, india, finally  gained  its  independence  
You  can  see  that  the  health  started  to  improve  
In  '92, india  follows  with  a  market  reform  
And  they  go  quite  closely  together, and  you  can  see  that  the  similarity  with  india  and  china  in  many  ways  are  greater  than  the  differences  with  them.
Kerala  is  flying  on  top  there  matching  united  states  in  health, but  not  in  economy  
We  have  an  enormous  disparity  in  the  world.
You  see  china  under  foreign  domination, actually  lowered  their  income  and  came  down  to  the  indian  level  here, 
Japan, did  it  like  this  until  full  catch  up? And  then  they  follow  with  the  other  high-income  economies.
Can  be  worse, can  be  better  
But  more  recently, I've  been  turning  my  attention  to  the  universe  on  the  largest  scale.
By  invisible, i  mean, it  Doesn't  absorb  in  the  electromagnetic  spectrum.
When  those  measurements  are  made  instead, what  we  find  is  that  the  speed  is  basically  constant  as  a  function  of  distance, 
In  fact, this  galaxy  and  every  other  galaxy  appears  to  be  embedded  in  a  cloud  of  this  invisible.
It  would  be  nice  if  we  could  see  this  dark  matter  a  little  bit  more  directly  
Now, how  do  we  deduce  where  the  galaxy  is  
Where  will  this  observer?
So  There's  a  whole  ray  of  light  --  rays  of  light  on  a  cone  --  that  will  all  be  bent  by  that  cluster  and  make  it  into  the  Observer's  eye.
So  actually  at  home  whenever  we  break  a  Wineglass, i  save  the  bottom. Take  it  over  to  the  machine  shop.
We  shave  it  off, and  i  have  a  little  gravitational  lens.
And  we  see  these  gravitational  lensing  effects. These  Distortions  that  say  that, again  clusters  are  embedded  in  dark  matter.
They're  moving  away  from  each  other  because  space  itself  is  getting  bigger. Ok?
So  in  the  last  century, ok, people  debated  about  whether  this  expansion  of  space  would  continue  forever, whether  it  would  slow  down, you  know, will  be  slowing  down, but  continue  forever, slow  down  and  stop  Asymptotically, stop  or  slow  down, stop  and  then  reverse. So  it  starts  to  contract. Again.
By  how  much  less  is  it  expanding  today, compared  to  say, a  couple  of  billion  years  ago, 
So  we  need  something  to  be  able  to  explain  that  
But  we  Don't  know  if  either  of  those  are  actually  the  dark  matter  candidate, ok, 
They  Haven't  seen  anything, ok, but  it  puts  limits  on  what  the  mass  and  the  interaction  strength  of  these  dark  matter  particles  are  
There's  going  to  be  a  satellite  telescope  launched  later  this  year, and  it  will  look  towards  the  middle  of  the  galaxy  to  see  if  we  can  see  dark  matter, particles, Annihilating  and  producing  gamma  rays  that  could  be  detected  with  this  
Now, unfortunately, there  is  a  lot  of  new  physics  whose  signature  could  be  missing  energy. So  it  will  be  hard  to  tell  the  difference.
And  finally, for  future  endeavors, there  are  telescopes  being  designed  specifically  to  address  the  questions  of  dark  matter  and  dark  energy  --  Ground-based  telescopes.
And  over  the  course  of  half  an  hour, not  one  syringe  was  filmed  being  Unwrapped

In  china, recycling  is  a  major  issue  
And  they  use  them  in  the  breaks  for  water  pistols.
And  they  are  having  great  fun  
And  they  squirt  the  water  into  their  mouths.
You  load  it  up  in  the  normal  way.
Imagine  that  Orchestration  
This  happens  every  year  
And  one  time  he  came  up  to  me  --  he  was  about  seven  or  eight  years  old  --  he  came  up  to  me.
And  there  was  a  Wasp's  nest  that  i  had  let  grow  in  my  yard  right  outside  my  door.
And  like  knock  like  a  Woodpecker  on  my  door, until  i  opened  it  up  
And  i  told  him, you  know, cody, the  wasps  actually  made  that  
They're  the  people  who  make  the  bullet  train  
And  those  bumps  act  like  a  magnet  for  water  
And  the  fog  comes  in, and  it  builds  up  on  the  tips.
Now  It's  reversing  that  equation  and  actually  sequestering  half  a  ton  of  co2.
They  actually  export  water  molecules  through  
And  those  Scalloped  edges  play  with  flow  in  such  a  way  that  is  reduces  drag  by  32  percent.
The  question  is  --  biomimicry  is  an  incredibly  powerful  way  to  innovate  
And  we  are  in  a  long  long  line  of  organisms  to  come  to  this  planet  and  ask  ourselves, how  can  we  live  here  gracefully  over  the  long, haul  
Now, in  order  to  do  this  the  design  challenge  of  our  century, i  think  we  need  a  way  to  remind  ourselves  of  those  geniuses  and  to  somehow  meet  them.
And  We're  working  with  Eol  encyclopedia  of  life.
And  this  is  a  pretty  well-educated  audience, so  i  imagine  you  all  know  something  about  aids  
If  you  know  something  more, you  probably  know  that  uganda  to  date  is  the  only  country  in  sub-saharan  africa  that  has  had  success  in  Combating.
But  I'm  going  to  use  tools  and  ideas  that  are  familiar  to  economists  to  think  about  a  problem  That's, more, traditionally  part  of  public  health  and  epidemiology  
We  see  almost  no  change  in  sexual  behavior.
Aids  is  the  same  kind  of  thing  It's  costly  to  avoid  aids  
And  the  way  that  I'm  going  to  do  that  is  I'm  going  to  look  across  areas  with  different  levels  of  malaria  
And  so  people  who  live  in  areas  with  a  lot  of  malaria  are  going  to  have  lower  life  expectancy  than  people  who  live  in  areas  with  limited  malaria, 
Even  if  you  only  cared  about  aids  in  africa, it  might  still  be  a  good  idea  to  invest  in  malaria  in  Combating, poor  indoor  air  quality  in  improving  maternal  mortality  rates.
If  people  have  no  incentive  to  avoid  aids  on  their  own, even  if  they  know  everything  about  the  disease, they  still  may  not  change  their  behavior.
We  know  they  had  this  campaign  That's, how  we  learn  about  what  works  
So  this  is  another  way  to  see  this  
So  i  am  going  to  talk  about  exports  and  prices  
But  openness  and  Inter-connectedness, it  comes  with  a  cost  when  we  think  about  disease, i  Don't  think  this  should  be  a  surprise  
Areas  with  a  lot  of  economic  activity  --  with  a  lot  of  roads  with  a  lot  of  urbanization  --  those  areas  have  higher  prevalence  than  others.
And  What's  really, really  great  about  being. Here  is  I'm.
It's  great  being  here  at  ted  
Their  relationship  is  a  love  story  that  feeds  the  earth  
It  reminds  us  that  we  are  a  part  of  nature  and  We're, not  separate  from  it.
Well, their  answer  was  It's, all  about  risk  and  reward  
And  chip  taylor  our  monarch  butterfly  expert. He  replied, nothing  lasts  forever.
And  that  blew  my  mind

This  is  about  tough, policing, equal  policing, 
I  now  went  to  a  prison  assignment  as  a  police  officer  
Here, i  got  a  prison  assignment, 
Obviously  it  was  
And  then  how  did  i  deal  with  them?
The  first  day, when  i  went  in, i  Didn't  know  how  to  look  at  them.
I  said, do  you  pray? Do  you  want  to  pray?
I  think  That's  the  bigger  change  
Teachers  were  prisoners.
You  want  to  know  more  about  this  go  and  see  this  film  doing  time  doing  Vipassana  
Let  me  wrap  it  up  
But  the  best  part  is  the  message  that  the  yahoo  help  desk  got  about  20  minutes  later, 
Captcha  project  is  something  that  we  did  here  at  carnegie  Melllon  over  10  years  ago  and  It's  been  used  everywhere.
So  then  i  started  feeling  bad  
So  can  we  get  you  to  do  useful  work  for  those  10  seconds?
So  you  start  with  a  book, and  then  you  scan  it  
For  example, for  things  that  were  written  more  than  50  years  ago, the  computer  Cannot  recognize  about  30  percent  of  the  words.
Johnedwardscom  so  we  keep  on  Insulting  people  left  and  right  everyday  
There  are  tens  of  thousands  of  these  
Some  of  them  are  very  cute  
And  it  is  numbers  like  these  that  motivate  my  research  agenda  
It  Hasn't  yet  been  launched  It's  called  duolingo, 
It  started  with  me  posing  a  question  to  my  graduate  student, Severin  hacker, 
Actually  it  was  a  forum  post, 
Remember  It's  a  question  about  javascript  
Okay, so  computer  translation  not  yet  good  enough, 
We  could  pay  professional  language  translators  to  translate  the  whole  web.
We  could  do  that  
If  we  wanted  to  translate  the  other  80  percent  into  spanish, it  would  cost  at  least  50  million  dollars  --  and  this  is  at  even  the  most  exploited  outsourcing  country  out  there.
So  it  would  be  very  expensive  
For  example, in  the  united  states  alone, there  are  over  five  million  people  who  have  paid  over  $500  for  software  to  learn  a  new  language.
There's, of  course, a  lot  of  very  simple  sentences  on  the  web.
Since  all  the  projects  that  my  group  has  worked  on  so  far  have  gotten  millions  of  users  We're, hopeful  that  We'll  be  able  to  translate  extremely  fast  with  this  project.
So  Here's  the  site  
But  then, by  the  end  of  the  decade, the  country  had  fallen  back  into  political  instability  and  Mismanagement  
We  the  children  had  gathered  at  a  Friend's  house  
I  wanted  to  document  on  film, the  2008  presidential  elections  
And  there  i  started  by  searching  for  the  footprints  in  my  childhood  
The  polling  stations  opened  to  the  voters  at  700  am  but  voters  eager  to  take  their  own  political  fate  into  their  hands  were  starting  to  line  up  at  400.
They  were  chanting: we  want  peace  
Now, the  uphill  battle  for  ghana, and  for  africa  is  not  over. But  i  have  proof  that  the  other  side  of  democracy  exists, and  that  we  must  not  take  it  for  granted.
That  --  you  know, i  was  born  thinking  about  things  that  way, and  i  had  always  been  like  a  little  scientist  guy  
And  people  in  the  17th  century, they  Didn't  really  understand  the  same  way  we  do  about, you  know, this  stuff  is  a  bunch  of  different  kinds  of  molecules, and  we  breathe  it  in  for  a  purpose.
And  boyle  said, bullshit  
And  so  charles  said  I'm  going  to  put  up  the  money, give  you  guys  a  building  come  here, and  you  can  meet  in  the  building, but  just  Don't  talk  about  religion  in  there.
But  experimental  science  had  been  tied  up  with  all  those  things  
Kary  Mullis, they  might  have  done  it  for  the  teddy  bear.
I  thought  that  anybody  with  any  brains  will  do  it  that  way  
I  was  thinking  about  making  my  own  little  rockets.
That's  why  i  thought, as  long  as  i  Don't  blow  my  eyes  out  
I  may  not  care  about  the  fact  that  It's  prohibited  from  heating, this  solution, 
I'm, sure, It's  got  to  do  with  rockets, or  it  Wouldn't  be  in  that  manual  
And  it  --  they  burned  
At  any  rate, i  bring  it  up  because  It's  a  good  story. And  he  said, tell  personal  things, you  know  and  That's, a  personal  --  i  was  going  to  tell  you  about  the  first  night  that  i  met  my  wife, but  that  would  be  too  personal  Wouldn't.
But  in  the  actual  process, you  get  an  idea  --  like, when  i  got  the  idea  one  night  that  i  could  amplify  dna  with  two  Oligonucleotides, and  i  could  make  lots  of  copies  of  some  little  piece  of  dna. You  know, the  thinking  for  that  was  about  20  minutes  while  i  was  driving  my  car. And  then  instead  of  going  --  i  went  back  and  i  did  talk  to  people  about  it.
But  i  knew  You'd  go  into  the  lab  and  You'd  try  to  make  it  work  yourself  and  then  You're  the  authority. And  you  can  say, i  know, it  works. Because  right  there  in  that  tube  is  where  it  happened. And  here  on  this  gel  There's, a  little  band  there  that  i  know  That's  dna  and  That's  the  dna, i  wanted  to  amplify  so  there. So  it  does  work.
So  you  have  to  be  honest  
Now, Let's  see  
They  made  bigger  guns  to  shoot  them  down  with  
And  the  people  I'm  talking  about  are  people  that  like  --  they  say  that  They're  a  member  of  the  committee  called  say, the  Inter-governmental  panel  on  climate  change, 
So  the  planet  should  get  warmer  
So  the  planet  is  a  pretty  amazing  thing, you  know, It's  big  and  horrible  --  and  big  and  wonderful, and  it  does  all  kinds  of  things.
In  new  york  city, rats  are  part  of  Commuters'  daily  lives.
I  was  very  fond  of  this  space  because  It's  the  first  massive  industrial  complex, i  found  on  my  own. That  is  abandoned  .
The  nature  had  really  Reclaimed  the  whole  complex  
I  was  really  frightened  at  first, but  i  Calmly  explained  to  him  that  i  was  working  on  an  art  project, and  he  Didn't  seem  to  mind. And  so  i  went  ahead  and  put  my  camera  on  Self-timer  and  ran  back  and  forth.
That  homeless  man  to  me  really  represented  an  element  of  the  unconscious  of  the  city.
They  were  consistently  dug  as  limestone  quarries. And  by  the  18th  century, the  Caving-in  of  some  of  these  quarries  posed  safety  threats. So  the  government  ordered  Reinforcing  of  the  existing  quarries  and  dug  new  observation  tunnels  in  order  to  monitor  and  map  the  whole  place.
As  you  can  see, the  system  is  very  complex  and  vast  
I'm  going  to  try  and  explain  why  it  is  that  perhaps  we  Don't  understand  as  much  as  we  think  we  do  
I  think  we  agree  on  that  where  does  the  tree  get  the  stuff  that  makes  up  this  chair? Right?
And  would  you  be  able  to  kind  of  draw  a  --  you  Don't  have  to  draw  the  diagram, but  would  you  be  able  to  draw  the  diagram  if  you  had  to  do  it?
That's, what  plants  actually  do  for  a  living  
So  these  mental  models  --  we  look  for  evidence  that  reinforces  our  models  
And  It's  amateur, but  amateur  in  the  best  sense.
And  governments  do  very  well.
Ok, we  Collude. And  actually, if  you  --  if  someone  had  designed  a  test  for  me, when  i  was  doing  my  biology  exams  to  really  understand  to  see  whether  I'd  understood  more  than  just  kind  of  putting  starch  and  Iodine  together  and  seeing  it, go  blue  and  really  understood  that  plants  took  their  mass  out  of  the  air. Then  i  might  have  done  better  at  science.
I  love  manipulating  the  infrastructure  of  biology, 
But  within  that  infrastructure, we  have  to  remember  that  the  driving  force  of  biology  is  really  coming  from  evolution.
This  is  a  dead  crystal  and  I'm  going  to  do  something  to  it  and  It's  going  to  become  alive.
But  There's  a  problem  because  up, until  maybe  a  decade  ago, we  were  told  that  life  was  impossible, and  that  we  were  the  most  incredible  miracle  in  the  universe.
If  we  can  make  matter  alive, would  we  have  a  Matterhazard  
Chemists  are  trying  to  study  the  molecules  to  look  at  disease.
You  can  decode  the  genome, you  can  look  back. You  can  link  us  all  together  by  a  mitochondrial  dna. But  we  Can't  get  further  than  the  last  ancestor, the  last  visible  cell  that  we  could  sequence  or  think  back  in  history.
What  is  life? What  is  this  stuff  of  life?
So  the  whole  Area's  been  stuck  for  a  while, and  it  got  Reignited  in  the  '80s  when  analytical  technologies  and  computer  technologies  were  coming  on  
And  the  answer, of  course, lies  with  mice  
They're  all  made  of  the  same  stuff, but  they  want  their  shape  to  win.
And  that  is  the  key  
Let's, zoom  out  to  what  that  could  mean  
If  we  could  get  evolution  into  the  material  world, then  i  propose  we  should  have  a  general  theory  of  evolution.
And  That's  really  worth  thinking  about  
So  that  means  we  could  then  start  to  develop  different  platforms  for  exploring  this.
So  you  imagine, if  We're  able  to  create  a  self-sustaining  artificial  life  form, not  only  will  this  tell  us  about  the  origin  of  life  --  that  It's  possible  that  the  universe  Doesn't  need  carbon  to  be  alive.
But  not  only  just  that, we  will  start  to  think  about  how  we  can  start  to  develop  a  symbiotic  relationship  with  biology.
Evolution  Cannot  be  cut  apart, 
And  We're  really  becoming  very  close  to  understanding  the  key  steps  that  makes  dead  stuff  come  alive.
We  are  here  today  because  [the]  united  nations  have  defined  goals  for  the  progress  of  countries.
Look  here  --  you  have  to  end, poverty, education, gender, child  and  maternal  health  control  infections, protect  the  environment  and  get  the  good  global  links  between  nations  in  every  aspect  from  aid  to  trade  
That's, a  four  percent  reduction  per  year  --  and  this  with  measuring  
I'll  prove  them  wrong  on  both  points.
And  i  will  take  kenya  as  an  example.
I  was  actually  on  friday  sitting  in  front  of  my  computer.
That's, unfair  
Had  i  been  in  the  ministry  of  health  in  kenya, i  may  have  joined  these  two  points.
So  look  at  the  average  here  --  this  is  the  average  for  all  of  sub-saharan  africa.
I  give  you  congo, which  was  high  ghana  --  lower  and  kenya  --  even  lower  
Their  countries  are  so  different, and  they  merit  to  be  recognized  in  the  same  way, as  we  Don't  talk  about  europe  as  one  place.
There  we  are  today  
How  the  heck  could  they  be  [a]  developing  country?
Look  --  even  if  we  look  in  africa  --  these  are  the  african  countries  
It's  very  clear  that  this  is  what  happens  
That  is  when  we  get  girls  in  school  We'll  get  an  impact  15  to  20  years  later, which  is  a  secular  trend, which  is  very  strong  
It's  a  decent  life  for  children.
Do  we  care  about  those  four  billion  people  whose  income  levels  are  less  than  two  dollars  a  day, the  so-called  bottom  of  the  pyramid, 
But  if  you  Don't  have  money, what  happens  
And  if  they  do  so  then, of  course, the  conditions  improve  and  they  start  riding  on  Scooters  
An  innovator  is  one  who  does  not  know  it  Cannot  be  done  
They  combine  all  that  
And  it  was  that  compassion  which  bothered  them.
For  example, how  we  started  ratan  just  began  with  a  Five-engineer  team, young  people  in  their  Mid-twenties  
It  was  an  open  innovation  ideas  from  all  over  were  welcome  :
And  the  seat  Riser, for  example, serving  as  a  mounting  for  the  seat  as  well  as  a  structural  part  of  the  functional  Rigidity  
And  british  motor  was  around  11000  
And  unbelievably  in  40  years, i  was  the  first  indian  to  be  honored  
And  unique, High-ankle  design  and  human-like  looks  [unclear]  and  functions.
Are  you  getting  more  drugs  because  you  are  spending  more  time  and  more  money, 
The  ideas  have  to  be  such  that  you  think, in  completely  different  terms, 
And  incubator  costs  2000  dollars  
But  then  he  held  it  for  a  little  while  lakshmi  
That  gave  me  a  great  message  focus, and  you  can  achieve  
And  currently  I'm  president  of  global  research  alliance, 60000  scientists  in  nine  counties, right  from  india  to  the  us.
Commodities  are  things  that  you  grow  in  the  ground, raise  on  the  ground  or  pull  out  of  the  ground  basically  animal  mineral  vegetable  
Long-distance  telephone  service, sold  on  price  price  price  fast-food  restaurants  with  all  their  value  pricing. And  even  the  internet  is  Commoditizing, not  just  goods, but  services  as  well.
Now, most  places  that  i  talk  to  when  i  talk  about  experience, i  talk  about  disney  --  the  World's  premier  Experience-stager  
And  then  i  always  finish  off  by  talking  about  --  the  thing  that  amazes  me  the  most  about  this  question, particularly  coming  from  the  dutch  is  that  the  netherlands  is  every  bit  as  manufactured  as  disneyland  
In  fact, you  can  look  at  how  each  of  these  economies  developed  that  each  one  has  their  own  business, imperative, matched  with  a  consumer  sensibility.
Because  all  businesses  are  man-made  objects. All  business  is  involved  with  money. All  business  is  a  matter  of  using  machinery.
At  the  end  of  a  laundry  list  of  advice  He's  giving  to  his  son  Laertes, he  says  this.
As  businesses  are  the  economic  offerings  you  are  providing  --  are  they  true  to  themselves?
And  of  course, if  you  are  both  true  to  yourself  and  are  what  you  say, you  are  then  You're, real, real  
Universal  city  walk  is  a  real  fake  --  in  fact, we  got  this  very  term  from  Ada  Louise  Huxtable's  book, the  unreal  america, 
But  is  it  really  true  to  itself  
So  she  calls  it  a  real  fake  
So  understand  what  --  your  past  limits, what  you  can  do  in  the  future.
Right  if  you  could  check  into  the  ads, You'd  have  a  great  experience.
Then  you  have  that  perception, that  you  are  phony  
A  few  words  about  how  i  got  started, and  it  has  a  lot  to  do  with  happiness  actually, 
I  would  make  things  for  people  as  a  way  of, you  know, giving  showing  them  my  love  
So  it  has  to  end  with  this  --  --  gratuitous  violence, 
So  that  was  how  i  first  started  to  explore  the  way  things  moved  and  expressed.
I  was  also  very  interested  in  perhaps  going  into  surgery  and  becoming  a  surgeon, because  it  meant  working  with  my  hands  in  a  very  focused  intense  way.
When  i  see  objects, i  imagine  them  in  motion  
That's  about  that  big  
This  kind  of  work  is  also  very  much  like  Puppetry  where  the  found  object  is  in  a  sense, the  puppet  and  I'm  the  Puppeteer  at  first  because  I'm  playing  with  an  object  
And  they  would  coalesce  for  just  a  moment. So  you  could  perceive  that  there  was  a  chair  there.
What  would  i  love  
So  this  is  a  little  Wire-bending  tool  
After  many  years  of  bending  gears  with  a  pair  of  Pliers, i  made  that  tool.
And  the  idea  their  premise  was  that  we  wanted  to  show  pieces  of  sculpture  on  the  street  and  There'd  be  no  subjective  decision  about  what  was  the  best  
So  I'll, just  let  this  chair  come  down.
And  what  we  were  going  to  do  was  scan  a  new  project  on  the  development  of  the  fetus  from  conception  to  birth  using  these  kinds  of  new  technologies.
25  days  heart  chamber, developing  32  days, arms  &amp. Hands  are  developing  36  days  beginning  of  the  primitive  Vertabrae.
51  days  52  days  developing  retina  nose  and  fingers, the  Fetus'  continual  movement  in  the  womb  is  necessary  for  muscular.
Every  six  months  until  They're  six  years  old  --  We're  going  to  be  doing  actually  to  about  250  children  --  watching  exactly  how  the  Gyri  and  the  Sulci  of  the  brains, fold  to  see  how  this  magnificent  development  actually  turns  into  memories  and  the  marvel  that  is  us  
I'm, a  Spectroscopist  
Sometimes  we  have  to  deal  with  just  one  tiny, weak  spectral  line  to  measure  the  composition  of  that  chemical  element  in  the  atmosphere.
For  instance, you  see  the  spectral  line  of  the  gold  is  the  only  spectral  line  in  the  spectrum  of  the  sun.
It's, a  heavy  element  produced  in  Thermonuclear  explosions  of  Supernovae  
It's  the  only  place  where  you  can  produce  actually  Osmium  
It  was  incredible.
They  actually  said  that  one  of  the  stars  you  see  in  the  spectra  is  an  alien. It  comes  from  a  different  galaxy.
And  sometimes  they  just  capture  stars  
We  were  very  surprised  to  discover  a  super  flare, a  flare, which  is  thousands  of  millions  of  times  more  powerful  than  those. We  see  in  the  sun.
This  can  be  done  with  the  future.
Coming  back  to  the  most  important  question, is  there  anybody  out  there? ?
Connection  between  life  and  radioactive  nuclei  is  straightforward  
It's  exactly  the  same  game, a  very  tiny  feature  
It's  amazing  that  we  can  detect  vegetation  from  a  spectrum.
Now, very  recently, very  recently, I'm  talking  about  last  six, seven, eight  months, water, methane, carbon  dioxide  have  been  detected  in  the  spectrum  of  a  planet  outside  the  solar  system.
And  with  the  known  physics, etc  It's  something  actually, which  has  been  pointed  out  by  frank  drake, many  years  ago  and  Shklovsky  
They  want  to  actually  signal  their  presence  through  these  spectral  lines  in  the  spectrum  of  a  star  in  different  ways.
And  we  are  doing  this  job  since  2000  and  It's  a  very  heavy  project, 
We  have  been  working  very  hard  
I  think  it  will  come  from  a  spectrum  like  this  
It  will  take  about  five  years.
And  she  said, but  the  thing  i  liked  about  your  talk  is  You're  a  storyteller  
And  she  said, I'm  going  to  call  you  a  storyteller  
I'm, a  qualitative, researcher  
And  maybe  I'm  just  a  storyteller  
The  other  thing  that  they  had  in  common  was  this, they  fully  embraced  vulnerability, 
They're  willing  to  invest  in  a  relationship  that  may  or  may  not  work  out  
Do  you  have  any  recommendations  
And  i  said, I'm, great  I'm, okay, 
I  just  need  some  strategies  
And  then, i  said, It's  bad  right, 
The  problem  is  --  and  i  learned  this  from  the  research  --  that  you  Cannot  selectively  numb  emotion, 
You  Can't  numb, those  hard  feelings  without  Numbing.
Religion  has  gone  from  a  belief  in  faith  and  mystery  to  certainty  
There's, no  conversation  
Which  just  i  hope  in  100  years, people  will  look  back  and  go. Wow? .
And  when  you  hold  those  perfect  little  babies  in  your  hand, our  job  is  not  to  say, look  at  her  She's, perfect  
My  job  is  just  to  keep  her  perfect  --  make  sure  she  makes  the  tennis  team  by  fifth  grade.
We  do  that  in  our  personal  lives, 
It  is, as  you  can  see  very  small  and  also  very  cheap  
So  that  when  we  think  about  using  them  to  get  some  systematic  improvement, we  also  think  about  how  they  can  be  useful  for  Self-improvement  for  Self-discovery  self-awareness, self-knowledge  
Some  people  will  say, It's  for  public  health  research  
Thank  you  
I  want  to  talk  about  it  in  the  context  of  a  story  
All  of  our  Statuses  are  different  
All  of  our  hopes  and  dreams, what  we  want  to  accomplish  is  different  and  our  paths  will  be  different. They  are  all  stories.
And  go  from  this  concept  of  walking  breathing  and  then  his  hands, speak  and  ultimately  happiness  and  function  
And  we  took  this  and  we  converted  it  into  data  
But  It's, not  a  data  point  at  that  one  moment  in  time, 
So  Here's, steven  alone, sharing  this  story  in  the  world, 
We  need  to  give  to  others  to  be  successful  
And  I'm  going  to  show  you  what  patients  like  me.
But  you  can  aggregate  this, and  you  can  discover  things  about  treatments.
So  you  can  see  the  duration  
I'm  going  to  log  in  
And  this  is  a  new  version  of  our  platform  We're  launching  right  now.
I'm  taking  three  drugs  to  manage  it.
So  can  i  take  this  data  --  rearrange  yourself  put  the  symptoms  in  the  left, the  drugs  across  the  top, tell  me  everything  we  know  about  steven  and  everyone  else.
Doctors  actually  love  this  sheet  and  They're  actually, really  engaged  
Ten  percent  of  the  people  in  our  system  took  lithium  
It's  never  going  to  work.
And  then  we  say, well, how  do  we  line  them  all  up  
And  it  works  almost  every  time.
And  yeah, all  the  clinicians  in  the  audience  will  talk  about  power  and  all  the  standard  Deviation  We'll  do  that  later  
We  hired  them  set  them  up  Assisting  at  lab.
Because  something  went  different  
And  i  am  thankful  
We  know  what  they  are  
The  B15  iceberg  broke  off  the  ross  ice  shelf, 
And  what  if  we  could  get  exquisite  control  over  the  essence  of  energy, the  electron  
A  tremendous  amount  of  energy  is  coming  at  us  from  the  sun.
Wouldn't  it  be  really  great  if  the  window  could  flick  back  the  heat  into  the  room, if  we  needed  it  or  flick  it  away  before  it  came  in  
We'd  have  to  see  at  night  right?
But  because  It's  flexible, it  can  be  on  any  surface  whatsoever.
It  was  in  actually  a  diner  outside  of  Dallas/fort  worth  airport.
Ebox  is  testing  new  Nanomaterials  to  park  an  electron  on  the  outside. Hold  it  until  you  need  it, and  then  be  able  to  release  it  and  pass  it  off.
19  trillion  dollars  is  what  We're  going  to  have  to  spend  
I'm  glad  to  be  working  with  incredibly  brilliant  and  kind  scientists, no  kinder  than  many  of  the  people  in  the  world. But  they  have  a  magic. Look  at  the  world.
By  any  standard, this  is  wrong.
I  was  two  years  older  than  my  sister  at  the  time  --  i  mean, I'm  two  years  older  than  her  now  --  but  at  the  time  it  meant  she  had  to  do  everything  that  i  wanted  to  do. And  i  wanted  to  play  war.
And  on  the  other  side  were  all  my  Sister's, my  little  Ponies, ready  for  a  cavalry  charge  
I  was  nervous, because  my  parents  had  charged  me  with  making  sure  that  my  sister  and  i  played  as  safely  and  as  quietly  as  possible  
With  one  broken  leg, 
I  can  delete  that  dot  because  That's  clearly  a  measurement  error  
So  one  of  the  very  first  things, we  teach  people  in  economics  and  statistics  and  business. And  psychology  courses  is  how  in  a  statistically  valid  way.
When  i  applied  to  harvard, i  applied  on  a  dare  
I  Didn't  expect  to  get  in  and  my  family  had  no  money  for  college  
Which  I'm  glad  you  liked, but  they  did  not  like  that  at  all  
Here's  how  we  get  to  health, we  need  to  reverse  the  formula  for  happiness  and  success  
Doctors  are  19  percent  faster, more  accurate  at  coming  up  with  the  correct  diagnosis  when  positive  instead  of  negative  neutral  or  stressed  
What  we  need  to  be  able  to  do  is  to  reverse  this  formula.
Exercise  teaches  your  brain  that  your  behavior  matters.
And  by  the  way, all  of  these  numbers  are  significantly  higher, if  you  happen  to  be  black, if  you  happen  to  be  poor, if  you  happen  to  exist  in  an  Overcrowded  school, 
And  so  We're  starting  to  see  the  establishment  of  men  centers  and  men  studies  to  think  about, how  do  we  engage  men  in  their  experiences? In  the  university?
The  next  reason  that  Boys'  cultures  are  out  of  sync  with  school  cultures, there  are  fewer  male  teachers, 
But  male  role  models  for  boys, that  say, It's  all  right  to  be  smart  --  They've  got  dads. They've  got  Pastors, They've  got  cub  scout  leaders. But  ultimately, six  hours  a  day  five  days  a  week, They're  spending  in  a  classroom. And  most  of  those  classrooms  are  not  places  where  men  exist.
This  is  a  place  for  girls.
We  have  a  serious  compression  of  the  curriculum  happening  out  there.
And  if  you  ask  title, 1  teachers  They'll  tell  you  They've  got  about  four  or  five  boys  for  every  girl  That's  in  their  program  in  the  elementary  grades  
All  of  those  conversations  need  to  be  happening  
Who  has  a  computer?
Ok, so  everyone  has  a  computer  
I  went  to  mit  did  my  math, but  i  had  this  wonderful  opportunity  because  computers  had  just  become  visual  
Remember  that  moment  --  publishing  your  designs, 
I  Didn't  quite  get  it. And  paul  rand  was  a  kind  of  Crusty  designer.
This  is  the  first  sort  of  play  thing.
This  is  actually  bad  human  experiments.
See  humans  Don't  know  how  to  take  orders  the  Computer's.
This  guy  figured  out  how  to  get  the  computer  to  draw  with  two  pens  at  once, you  know, you  pen  do  this.
And  after  this, i  wanted  to  build  a  computer  out  of  people  called  a  human-powered  computer  
I  have  behind  this  wall, a  disk  drive  a  cpu  a  graphics  card  a  memory  system.
On  the  computer, when  you  move  your  mouse  that  arrow  moves  around  
I  have  no  staff  It's  all  kind  of  made  by  hand  --  these  sort  of  broken  hands  
So  naomi  was  pivotal  in  that  
So  if  you  can  see  here, you  know  that  program  You're  seeing  in  the  corner, if  you  spread  it  out  It's  all  these  things  all  at  once  
You  get  it  no, ok?
They're  Littler  computers. So  the  One-chip  computers, i  began  to  program  One-chip  computers  and  make  objects  out  of  pc  boards  leds.
I  did  a  show  in  london  last  year  made  out  of  ipods  --  i  used  ipods  as  a  material  
We  have  this  gene  defect  in  our  mind  
This  is  from  the  cape  last  year  
This  is  also  out  there, you  know, 
And  i  went  after  it  with  passion  
I  was  like, aha, wait.
So  thank  you.
What  is  it  about  flying  cars?
But  we  Haven't  yet  gotten  to  the  point  where, on  your  way  here  this  morning, you  see  something  that  really  truly  seamlessly  integrates, the  two-dimensional  world  that  We're  comfortable  in  with  the  three-dimensional  sky  above  us  --  that  i  Don't  know  about  you, but  i  really  enjoy  spending  time  in  
For  those  of  us  that  spend  most  of  our  lives  on  the  ground, this  may  be  Counter-intuitive, but  driving  has  Potholes  Cobblestones  pedestrians  other  drivers  and  a  rather  long  and  detailed  list  of  federal  motor  vehicle  safety  standards  to  Contend  with  
You  just  push  a  few  buttons  in  the  cockpit  and  the  wings  come  out.
Radio, 2  that  was  gorgeous  
The  transition  will  cost  in  line  with  other  small  airplanes.
And  I'm  certainly  not  out  to  replace  your  chevy. But  i  do  think  that  the  transition  should  be  your  next  airplane.
And  mobility  to  your  destination  is  clearly  solved  
The  question  was  given  to  a  bunch  of  engineers  about  15  years  ago. How  do  we  make  the  journey  to  paris  better?
What  you  should, in  fact, do  is  employ  all  of  the  World's  top  male  and  female  Supermodels, pay  them  to  walk  the  length  of  the  train. Handing  out  free  chateau  Petrus  for  the  entire  duration  of  the  journey.
They  seem  fantastic  to  me.
Someone  was  actually  suggesting  that  you  can  take  this  concept  further  and  actually  produce  placebo  education.
Before  long, there  was  a  massive  underground  Potato-growing  operation  in  germany, 
Now, boring  people  would  have  just  simply  banned  the  veil  
All  value  is  perceived  value.
These  funny  signs, that  flash  your  speed  at  you, some  of  the  new  ones  on  the  bottom  right  now  actually  show  a  smiley  face  or  a  Frowny  face  to  act  as  an  emotional  trigger.
The  wealthy  Prussians  to  help  in  the  war  against  the  french  were  encouraged  to  give  in  all  their  jewelry  
The  interesting  thing  is  that  for  50  years, hence, the  highest  status  jewelry  you  could  wear  in  prussia  Wasn't  made  of  gold  or  diamonds.
It  was  made  of  cast  iron  
Because  actually  never  mind  the  actual  intrinsic  value  of  having  gold  jewelry.
If  you  think  about  it, Shakerism  was  a  Proto-environmental  movement.
And  that  what  we  add  on  top  is  kind  of  false  It's, a  fake  version  
However, what  we  do  have  now  is  a  much  more  Variegated  media  ecosystem  in  which  to  kind  of  create  this  kind  of  value  and  It's  much  fairer  
Yet, We've  never  created  the  opportunity  for  impulse  saving  
I  would  say, It's  a  work  of  genius  
So  i  just  want  to  get  your  first  impressions, when  you  see  that  when  you  see  the  diamond  shreddies  box, there  
But  It's  kind  of  like  flipping  a  six  or  a  nine  like  a  six.
Thank  you  very  much  indeed, 
We're  seeing  the  consequences  all  around  us, 
I  would  say, not  just  biological  design, but  all  of  the  design  that  we  think  of  as  human  design  
And  100  pages  later, 
And  another  100  pages  later, 
Or  design  out  of  chaos  without  the  aid  of  mind  
Chaos, no, what  mind?
But  that  it  will  get  copied  if  it  can  regardless  of  the  consequences  
This  is  design  process  going  on  
A  meme  is  not  equivalent  to  an  idea.
Audience: sink: toilet  ,
This  has  spread  all  over  the  world.
So  this  is  a  view  of  what  humans  are  
And  indeed, in  the  short  time, I've  already  been  at  ted, i  see  We're  even  closer  than  i  thought  we  were  before  
We'll  think, We're  choosing  these  things. But  the  temes  are  making  us.
It's  been  very  productive  that  equation.
Getting  a  new  replicator  is  dangerous.
We  may  take  the  Gaian  view, 
You  know, all  about  big  brains, 
And  why  would  they  do  that  
So  those  are  the  two  possibilities  
I  have  no  idea  
I  was  afraid  of  a  tsunami. What  i  Didn't  realize  was  there  was  a  greater  terror  in  haiti, and  that  was  building  collapse.
After  all, it  was  the  buildings, not  the  earthquake  that  killed  220000.
Behind  that  door  is  the  national  Judicial.
Now, There's  a  solution  to  all  these  problems.
And  because  i  had  70  percent  of  my  body  burned, it  would  take  about  an  hour.
So  originally, i  Didn't  have  much  money.
Now, ten  commandments  is  something  that  is  hard  to  bring  into  the  education  system. So  we  said, why  Don't?
And  this  is  particularly  interesting  because  mit  Doesn't  have  an  honor  code  
No  bill  ever  disappeared.
We  did  not  pay  them  with  dollars. We  paid  them  with  something  else.
But  this  did  not  solve  the  big  problem.
So  everybody  got  an  envelope  with  all  the  money  for  the  experiment. And  we  told  them  that  at  the  end, we  asked  them  to  pay  us  back  the  money.
What  would  happen  to  the  other  people  in  the  group?
Will  they  cheat  more, or  will  they  cheat  less  
All  of  the  subjects  sitting  in  the  experiment  were  carnegie  mellon, students  
When  we  remind  people  about  their  morality, they  cheat  less  .
But  unless  we  start  testing  those  intuitions  We're  not  going  to  do  better  
Okay, 
Well, Cèilidh, first  of  all  is  gaelic  for  party. But  kitchen  party  in  cape  breton  is  very  common. And  basically  somebody  drops  into  the  house  and  no  matter  what  house  you  go  to  in  cape  breton. There's, a  fiddle  there  guaranteed  and  I'd  say, well, There's, first  of  all  more  Fiddlers  per  capita  in  cape  breton  than  anywhere  in  the  world. So  ten  chances  to  one  the  fellow  who  walked  in  the  door  could  play  it. So  You'd  have  someone  come  into  the  house. You'd, invite  them  to  play  a  tune. And  lo  and  behold, a  little  party  would  start  up  and  somebody  would  dance  and  somebody  would  sing  and  all  that  sort  of  thing. So  it  was  a  wonderful  wonderful  way  to  grow  up. And  that  is  where  my  beginnings  in  music. Come  from  my  surroundings, my  family, just  my  bloodline  in  itself. And  oh, I've  done  lots  of  things  with  my  music.
Donnell  leahy.
We  learned  to  play  the  instruments, but  we  kind  of  had  to  come  from  within  or  go  from  within  because  we  Didn't  watch  television. We  Didn't  listen  to  a  lot  of  radio. We  went  to  church  and  to  school  sometimes  and  farmed  and  played  music. So  we  were  able  i  think  at  a  very  critical  age  to  develop  our  own  style, our  own  self. And  my  mother  plays, my  father  plays  and  the  style  that  came  from  the  ottawa  valley  in  ontario. We  call  it  French-canadian  style, but  it  originated  in  logging  camps.
Airs  were  played  in  europe  at  Burials  as  a  body  was  carried  out  from  the  wake  site  to  the  burial  site. The  procession  was  led  by  a  Piper  or  a  fiddle  player.
We're  laughing  like  because  our  styles  are  totally  different  as  you  can  hear  
Announcer: great  news  They're, running  late  downstairs, 
When  she  got  up  to  make  tea, she  placed  him  in  my  own  lap, and  i  had  never  felt  a  child  that  was  that  Emaciated  
Single  mother, hiv, positive  ,
I  photographed  her  before  and  after  the  birth  of  her  beautiful  baby.
Joyce's  mother  is  now  taking  care  of  her  daughter  like  so  many  other  Zimbabwean  children  Who've  been  orphaned  by  the  epidemic.
And  i  was  constantly  reading  the  new  york  times  and  stunned  by  the  statistics.
So  i  quit  my  job  and  decided  that  That's  the  subject  that  i  wanted  to  tackle  
We've  known  about  fusion  since  1920  when  sir  arthur  stanley  Eddington  and  the  british  association  for  the  advancement  of  science, Conjectured  that  That's  why  the  sun  shines  
And  once  it  was  sort  of  explained  to  me  how  fast  we  were  using  up  the  World's  resources, i  got  very  upset  about  as  upset  as  i  did. When  i  realized  that  the  earth  will  only  last  about  five  billion  years  before  It's  swallowed  by  the  sun.
Energy  at  the  moment  is  dominated  by  resource  
It's  a  medium-sized  nucleus  
And  indeed, That's  exactly  what  stars  do  
So  That's  that  process, there  Deuterium  and  tritium  goes  together  makes  helium  5  
And  that  energy  is  what  powers  fusion  
And  as  you  go  across  there, you  see  a  few  tens  of  years  of  oil  --  the  blue  line  by  the  way  is  the  lowest  estimate  of  existing  resources.
And  as  you  go  across  there, you  will  see  that  We've  got  a  few  tens  of  years.
So, how  would  we  make  it  
We  can  do  fusion  in  the  center  of  this  device.
If  you  want  to  know  how  ask  yourself  this  question, what  would  you  attempt  to  do  if  you  knew  you  could  not  fail?
Because  when  you  ask  it, you  begin  to  understand  how  the  fear  of  failure. Constrains  you  how  it  keeps  us  from  attempting, great  things  and  life  gets  dull. Amazing  things  stop  happening.
The  path  to  truly  new  Never-been-done-before  things  always  has  failure  along  the  way.
In  october  of  1903, the  prevailing  opinion  of  expert  Aerodynamicists  was  that  maybe  in  10  million  years, we  could  build  an  aircraft  that  would  fly  .
40  years  later, Aero  experts  coined  the  term  Transonic  
Since  we  took  to  the  sky, we  have  wanted  to  fly  faster  and  farther  
It's  Boosted  to  Near-space  atop  a  minotaur  iv, rocket  ,
That's  an  unnatural  act  for  a  rocket  
The  third  stage  has  a  camera  
This  is  the  actual  Rocketcam  footage  from  flight.
Now  to  conceal  the  shape, we  changed  the  aspect  ratio, a  little  bit  
This  is  a  hummingbird  drone.
It  does  not  eat  nectar.
Or  perhaps  spider  man  will  one  day  be  gecko.
Each  lightning  bolt  heats  the  air  to  44000  degrees  fahrenheit  --  hotter  than  the  surface  of  the  sun.
Using  a  grid  the  size  of  your  thumb  with  32  electrodes  on  the  surface  of  his  brain, tim  uses  his  thoughts  to  control  an  advanced  prosthetic  arm  
This  green  goo  is  perhaps  the  vaccine  that  could  save  your  life  
They  are  nerds, and  they  are  heroes  among  us.
There  is  only  time  enough  to  iron  your  cape  and  back  to  the  skies  for  you  
Well, i  Don't  think  we  ultimately  know  what  it  will  be  right.
It's  actually, look  at  that  cute  hummingbird  flying  into  my  headquarters.
Well, look  our  singular  mission  is  the  creation  and  prevention  of  strategic  surprise  
That's  what  we  do  
And  you  persuade  people  to  go  to  these  great  Feats  of  invention, but  at  a  personal  level  in  a  way, i  Can't  imagine  doing  your  job  
But  quite  frankly, on  this  issue, there  is  no  other  road.
Sorry, this  was  my  mother  by  the  way  in  her  bead  shop  in  london, 
Because  just  that  soil  could  make  the  acoustic  difference.
And  the  british  government  saying, you  need  to  be  in  the  top  five  
But  you  just  have  to  go  to  a  garden  center  and  They're  in  little  paper  packets  
And  so  there  was  one  particular  toy  that  gave  us  a  clue.
And  the  government  agreed  to  do  that  and  not  do  anything  else  and  focus  our  energy  on  that  
This  is  the  only  project  that  We've  done  where  the  finished  thing  looked  more  like  a  rendering  than  our  renderings.
I'm, sorry, about  my  stupid  voice: there  
So  if  we  could  chop  that  away  and  give  the  building  a  small  bottom, we  could  take  that  bit  and  put  it  at  the  top  where  the  greater  commercial  value  is  for  a  property.
Thank  you  
June  cohen, so  thank  you. Thank  you.
Well  that  fundamental  sense  of  oneness  is  lost  on  us  very  quickly.
The  self  changed  got  affected  broken  destroyed.
The  self  was  not  constant  
But  nature  had  its  wicked  way  and  brown  babies  were  born  
It  was  the  first  time  that  i  existed  inside  a  Fully-functioning  self  --  one  that  i  controlled  that  i  Steered  that  i  gave  life  to  
Well, i  thought  i  had  the  answer  to  that  one, and  i  said, skin  color, 
For  a  start, we  can  think  about  all  the  times  when  we  do  lose  ourselves.
I  take  it  to  therapy  
And  in  that  disconnected  state, yeah, we  can  build  factory  farms  with  no  windows  destroy  marine  life  and  use  rape  as  a  weapon  of  war  
Thank  you  for  listening  
You  can  see  my  fellow  riders  at  the  end  of  the  picture, looking  at  me  with  some  concern  
And  here  is  another  picture  of  them.
They  are  supposed  to  be  locked  up  
And  i  became  increasingly  more  and  more  Agitated, because  i  was  there  not  only  to  be  with  them, but  also  to  ride  and  create  a  team.
We're  going  downhill  in  some  rocky  terrain. And  the  front  tire  of  alex  gets  caught  in  one  of  these  crevasses  here.
I've  had  it  
It  took  me  several  such  incidents  to  figure  out  what  i  was  supposed  to  do.
At  the  beginning, it  was  a  disaster  
I  tried  harsh  words  and  threats, and  they  took  me  nowhere.
Go  away  you  Maniac-psychopath  
And  i  would  say, relax, alex, ,
So  for  such  a  kid, when  an  adult  that  he  learns  to  respect  stays  close  to  him  and  Doesn't  walk  away  from  him  in  any  situation, irrespective  of  how  he  behaves  It's, a  tremendous  healing  experience.
Now, i  come  from  a  Cutthroat  world  of  science  and  high  technology  
I  used  to  think  that  reason  and  logic  and  relentless  drive  were  the  only  ways  to  make  things  happen.
All  you  have  to  do  is  play  with  it  change  it  a  little  bit  and  come  up  with  something  that  does  help  that  does  work  
Or  you  can  also  look  back  in  time  and  realize  that  You've  already  conquered  Steeper  mountains  before  
And  so  we  talked  about  these  special  words  that  we  teach  them  
In  every  one  of  these  rides, i  always  end  up  standing  in  one  of  these  incredible  locations  taking  in  this  incredible  landscape  around  me.
The  blank  slate  was  an  influential  idea  in  the  20th  century.
This  is  a  recent  study  by  the  Neurobiologist.
And  as  you  can  see  large  amounts  of  the  brain  are  not  purple  showing  that  if  one  person  has  a  thicker  bit  of  cortex  in  that  region, so  does  his  fraternal  twin  
And  Here's  what  happens  if  you  get  a  pair  of  people  who  share  all  their  dna  --  namely, Clones  or  identical  twins.
Another  political  fear  of  human  nature  is  that  if  we  are  blank  slates, we  can  perfect  mankind  --  the  age-old  dream  of  the  Perfectibility  of  our  species  through  social  engineering.
And  so  when  thomas  jefferson  wrote  in  the  declaration  of  independence, we  hold  these  truths  to  be  Self-evident  that  all  men  are  created  equal. He  did  not  mean.
That  is  because  the  human  mind  is  a  complex  system  with  many  parts, and  some  of  them  can  inhibit  others.
For  example, There's  excellent  reason  to  believe  that  virtually  all  humans  are  born  with  a  moral  sense, and  that  we  have  cognitive  abilities  that  allow  us  to  profit  from  the  lessons  of  history.
Well, the  night  is  young, but  the  book  has  been  out  for  half  a  year  and  nothing  terrible  has  happened.
Visual  arts  --  decoration  of  surfaces  and  bodies  --  appears  to  be  a  human  universal  
A  paraphrase  of  a  quote  by  virginia  Woolf  and  There's  some  debate  as  to  what  she  actually  meant  by  that  
I  mean, this  is  perhaps  a  representative  example  of  the  visual  depiction  of  the  female  form  in  the  15th  century. Here  is  a  representative  example  of  the  depiction  of  the  female  form  in  the  20th  century.
Well, this  turned  out  to  be  probably  the  most  controversial  claim  in  the  book.
And  the  job  in  question  was  sheep: rancher  
This  one  was  actually  around  the  playing  cards. I   got  yesterday, but  it  had  a  certain  familiarity  to  it.
Albert  is  the  shepherd  in  question: ,
Albert  goes  in, i  follow  albert  the  crew  is  around  
I  say, time  out  stop  
We  Don't  fool  around, we  Don't  rehearse  --  we  shoot  what  we  get  
And  I'm, like  i  Don't  know  what  just  happened, but  there  are  Testicles  in  this  bucket  and  That's, not  how  we  do  it.
He  says, ok, 
Gets  up  walks  to  the  corner  It's  quivering, and  it  lies  down  and  It's  in  obvious, distress  
He's  like  a  day, 
And  i  was  reminded  how  utterly  wrong  i  am  so  much  of  the  time.
Melanie  picks  up  the  lamb, puts  it  on  the  post, opens  it  up  
I  do  
And  I'm  like, what  is  this  Jacked-up?
Anagnorisis  is  the  greek  word  for  discovery.
That's  Peripety  or  peripeteia  
It's  crushing  when  the  audience  sees  it, the  right  way, 
Looking  at  that  poor  other  little  thing  that  I'd  done  it, the  right  way  on. And  i  just  was  struck  by  if  I'm  wrong  about  that.
I  mean, these  are  the  people  that  i  work  with  every  single  day.
Because  dude, you  know, four  years  
You  know, follow  your  dreams  and  go  broke  right?
Right  
They  know  that  other  things  come  first  --  the  business  of  doing  the  work  comes  first  the  business  of  getting  it  done  
Most  Hazardous  environment  I'd  ever  seen. And  i  was  back  with  a  guy.
I  Scamper  down, i  go  into  the  Wheelhouse, and  i  say, with  some  level  of  Incredulity, captain  osha, 
It  goes  like  this  --  We've  declared  war  on  work  as  a  society.
We  turn  them  into  heroes, or  we  turn  them  into  punch  lines.
I  just  know  that  That's  a  front  in  this  war, 
And  i  realized  probably  too  late  in  this  game  --  i  hope  not  because  i  Don't  know  if  i  can  do  200  more  of  these  things  --  but  We're  going  to  do  as  many  as  we  can  
It's  been  great  talking  to  you  and  get  back  to  work.
Democracy, as  a  type  of  politics  is  a  technology  for  the  control  and  deployment  of  power  
I  would  put  it  in  the  following  equation.
Islam  represents  a  way  of  engaging  the  world  through  which  one  can  achieve  certain  desirable.
You  can  show  the  capitol  --  i  had  the  same  problem  when  i  was  designing  the  cover  of  my  Forthcoming  book, in  fact  --  what  do  you  put  on  the  cover  to  show  democracy?
You  can  show  a  mosque, or  you  can  show  Worshippers, but  There's, not  a  straightforward  way  of  depicting  islam  
These  are  contested  points  and  It's  impossible  to  answer  them  by  saying, ah, ha, i  looked  in  the  right  place.
And  i  think  that  That's, in  fact, probably  the  first  appropriate  response, 
And  the  hopeful  response  Derives  from  recognizing  that  islam  and  democracy  are  technologies  
And  They're  making  this  argument  wherever  They're  permitted  to  make  it  
They  were  actually  blocked  from  even  forming  a  party  under  the  political  system  there.
Now, what  i  want  to  suggest  to  you  is  that  the  reason  for  hope, in  this  case  is  that  we  are  on  the  edge  of  a  real  transformation  in  the  muslim  world.
When  these  heartbreaking  images  of  oiled  birds, finally  began  to  emerge  from  the  gulf  of  mexico. Last  year  during  the  horrific. Bp  oil  spill, a  german  biologist  by  the  name  of  Silvia  Gaus  was  quoted  as  saying  we  should  just  Euthanize  all  oiled  birds. Because  studies  have  shown  that  fewer  than  one  percent  of  them  survive  after  being  released.
And  the  local  Seabird  rescue  center  named  sanccob  immediately  launched  a  massive  rescue  operation  --  and  this  soon  would  become  the  largest  animal  rescue  ever  undertaken  
I  was  a  penguin  Aquarist  at  the  new  england  aquarium  
I  was  instantly  transported  back  to  that  moment  in  time.
So  for  the  few  of  us  that  were  there  in  a  professional  capacity, this  extraordinary  volunteer  response  to  this  animal  crisis  was  profoundly  moving  and  Awe-inspiring  
Now  mind  you  three  days  earlier, we  had  60  penguins  under  our  care, so  we  were  definitely  overwhelmed.
And  you  may  notice  They're  wearing  very  thick  gloves  
He  said, okay, why  Don't? We  try  and  collect  the  birds  at  the  greatest  risk  of  getting  oiled  --  they  collected  20000  --  and  We'll  ship  them, 500  miles  up  the  coast  to  port  elizabeth, in  these  open  air  trucks  and  release  them  into  the  clean  waters  there. And  let  them  swim  back  home.
About  a  year  prior  to  this  oil  spill, a  17  year-old  student  had  invented  a  Degreaser  
Just  look  at  that  17  year-old  
And  the  two  main  threats  to  penguins  today  are  overfishing  and  global  warming, 
And  i  was  doing  some  rather  controversial  religious  programs.
This  went  down  very  well  in  the  uk, where  religion  is  extremely  Unpopular  
Indeed, some  of  the  world  traditions, think  very  little  of  religious  Orthodoxy, 
You  behave  in  a  committed  way.
Why  because  in  compassion, when  we  feel  with  the  other, we  Dethrone  ourselves  from  the  center  of  our  world, and  we  put  another  person  there.
And  in  particular, every  single  one  of  the  major  world  traditions  has  highlighted  --  has  said  --  and  put  at  the  core  of  their  tradition, What's  become  known  as  the  golden  rule.
Hillel  stood  on  one  leg  and  said  that  which  is  hateful  to  you  do  not  do  to  your  neighbor. That  is  the  torah. The  rest  is  commentary.
So  the  traditions  also  insisted  --  and  this  is  an  important  point, i  think  --  that  you  could  not  and  must  not  confine  your  compassion  to  your  own  group, your  own  nation, your  own  Co-religionists, your  own  fellow  Countrymen. You  must  have  what  one  of  the  chinese  Sages  called  Jian  ai  concern  for  everybody. Love.
And  this  again  --  this  universal  outreach  --  is  getting  Subdued  in  the  Strident  use  of  religion  --  abuse  of  religion  --  for  Nefarious, gains  
Now, I've  lost  count  of  the  number  of  taxi  drivers, who  when  i  say  to  them, what  i  do  for  a  living  inform  me  that  religion  has  been  the  cause  of  all  the  major  world  wars  in  history  wrong.
Because  it  seems  to  me  that  with  --  our  current  situation  is  so  serious  at  the  moment  that  any  ideology  that  Doesn't  promote  a  sense  of  global  understanding  and  global  appreciation  of  each  other  is  failing  the  test  of  the  time.
I  was  part  of  that  united  nations  initiative  called  the  alliance  of  civilizations, which  was  asked  by  kofi  annan  to  diagnose  the  causes  of  extremism  and  to  give  practical  guidelines  to  member  states  about  how  to  avoid  the  Escalation  of  further  extremism  
It  was  just  one  of  those  Pot-luck  things  where  you  get  it  right  first  time, 
Moving  on  to  something  a  bit  larger.
It's, not  just  Topshop. I   get  some  strange  looks  when  i  go  out  getting  my  props.
And  to  carry  on  with  a  theme  that  We've  already  touched  with  is  how  nature  is  related  to  architecture.
In  fact, that  is  three  months  solid, X-raying, 
And  when  they  do  I'm  in  the  queue  
So  i  like  to  use  them  
That  flower  Doesn't  come  in  bright  orange.
I'm  now, going  to  show  you  a  short  film, I'll  step  to  the  side, 
The  bus  was  done  with  a  cargo-scanning  x-ray  machine, which  is  used  on  the  borders  between  countries, looking  for  contraband  and  illegal  immigrants  
I  will  show  how  the  capillary  action  works, how  it  feeds  I'll, be  able  to  get  all  the  cells  inside  that  stem  
Sometimes  you  keep  the  time  up  because  the  time  gives  you  detail  
The  longer  the  exposure  goes  on  for  the  more  detail.
I've  got  the  opportunity  now  to  show  you  what  I'm  going  to  be  doing  in  the  future  
Like  my  first  computer  was  a  big  movement  in  my  life.
Meet  tony  He's, my  student  
If  i  ever  get  out  of  here, there  will  always  be  a  mark  by  my  name.
I'm  a  Convict, i  am  branded  'wrong'. What  are  you  going  to  tell  me  about  right  and  wrong?
Then  can  you  tell  me  what  wrong  is  
Socrates  died  in  prison, his  philosophy, intact  ,
His  body  is  in  prison.
Yes, they  gave  12  monkeys  a  typewriter  for  a  week. And  after  a  week, they  only  used  it  as  a  bathroom.
You'll  been  engulfed  by  a  red  giant  
Love  does  not  die.
I'm  very  lucky  because  He's  better  than  all  the  other  children  
That's, the  wonderful  thing  about  evolution  --  the  predilection  to  believe  that  our  child  is  best  
Now, in  many  ways, That's  just  a  survival  thing.
The  fact  we  see  here  is  the  vehicle  for  our  genes, and  therefore  we  love  it  
But  we  Don't  notice  that  bit, we  just  Unconditionally  love  
Perhaps  You've  been  at  home  for  a  week  on  your  own  
You  house  is  in  a  terrible  state.
You  think, what  should  i  do  
For  me, It's  a  very, very  important  thing.
I  look  out  the  window, and  i  realize  that  every  single  time  we  stop  and  i  look  out  that  window  framed  in  that  window. Wherever  we  are. I   am  observing  more  life  than  there  is  in  the  rest  of  the  known  universe  beyond  the  planet  earth.
That  to  me  is  an  incredible  thing.
I  began  the  vagina  monologues, because  i  was  worried  about  vaginas  
What  does  anyone  mean  when  they  talk  about  real  security?
This  is, of  course, unless  your  whole  life  is  about  being  secure  
You  become  whatever  it  is  that  will  freeze.
But  all  this  does  actually  is  shut  down  your  mind  
One  of  the  amazing  things  that  I've  discovered  in  my  travels  is  that  there  is  this  emerging  species, 
I've  discovered  these  people  who  in  v-day  world, we  call  vagina  warriors.
They  raised  10000  dollars  on  a  production  that  never  occurred  
Now, this  seems  like  a  fairly, you  know, frivolous.
In  the  years  that  she  walked, she  educated, parents  mothers  fathers, 
Real  security  is  contemplating  death, not  pretending  it  Doesn't  exist.
And  i  think  part  of  what  I'm  learning  in  this  process  is  that  one  must  allow  oneself  to  feel  grief.
Now  i  was  stupid, but  not  so  stupid  that  i  turned  it  down  
It  is  the  story  factory.
But  they  all  have  one  thing  in  common. They  all  need  to  look  like  something.
They  all  need  a  face  
The  first  was  Katharine, Hepburn's  memoirs.
So  the  hepburn  story  is  words, and  the  dietrich  story  is  pictures.
And  what  i  ended  up  with  was  a  graphic  representation  of  us, seeing  this  animal  coming  into  being  
No  that  is  not  me.
That's  a  responsibility  
A  book  cover  is  a  distillation  
This  story  was  a  real  puzzle.
Huhh, and  now  the  sultan  is  in  danger, ,
Don't, get  me  started  
But  something  is  definitely  lost  tradition.
What  does  it  look  like?
Yes, it  can  it  does  and  it  will. But  for  this  book  designer  Page-turner  Dog-eared  Place-holder  notes  in  the  Margins-taker  Ink-sniffer.
The  students  should  teach  their  teachers  
Well, we  heard  that  one  too, but  pioneer  germ  fighters  totally  rules.
Instead  of  just  Scoffing  at  this  heresy, that  a  kid  wanted  to  get  published  or  saying, wait  until  You're  older, my  parents  were  really  supportive  
The  school  i  went  to  was  pretty  boring  
And  that  was  the  finishing  post, right  there  
But  our  school  at  that  time  got  a  grant  from  the  government, and  they  got  an  incredible  computer  --  the  research  machine, 3dz  --  and  they  left  the  programming  manuals.
That's  what  they  thought  they  had  built  it  for  
This  is  one  of  my  favorite  ones  here  where  they  have  rabbit  breeding.
So  i  went  on  for  the  next  20  years  or  so  making  a  lot  of  different  games.
Now, chris  did  ask  me  to  bring  some  statistics  with  me  so  I've  done  that  
But  83  percent  of  games  Don't  have  any  mature  content  whatsoever.
It  makes  about  80  million  bucks  a  month  in  subscriptions  
I  wanted  to  update  that  video  and  give  you  a  new  look  at  it.
I  played  in  the  backyard, learned  to  read  and  even  ate  some  of  my  vegetables  
But  as  was  the  case  for  most  of  my  generation, i  spent  a  lot  of  time  in  front  of  the  tv  
Their  importance  Blends  into  the  Sensationalized  drama  of  prime  time.
I  have  fought  in  wars  feared  for  my  own  survival, watched  my  Cohorts  die  on  beaches  and  woods  that  look  and  feel  more  real  than  any  textbook  or  any  news  story  
As  gamers, we  are  now  living  by  the  same  laws  of  physics  in  the  same  cities  and  doing  many  of  the  same  things  we  once  did  in  real  life, only  virtually  
The  sensory  cues  are  very  similar  
More  beautiful  and  rich  than  the  real  world  around  us.
Video  games  are  fun, engaging  and  leave  your  brain  completely  vulnerable  to  Re-programming  
There  is  a  potential  to  do  good  as  well.
Wow, 
This  is  just  a  cool  shot.
She's, never  going  to  know  a  world  where  video  games, Aren't, incredibly  emotional, and  will  probably  make  her  cry  
Chris  anderson: david  perry: that  was  awesome  
It's  this  change  in  perspective  on  what  it  is, we  think  We're  perceiving  that  has  helped  us  make  more  progress  in  the  last  400  years  than  we  have  in  the  rest  of  human  history.
So  one  of  the  things  that  goes  from  simple  to  complex  is  when  we  do  more, we  like  more  
And  in  fact, what  murray  was  talking  about  yesterday  in  the  fractal, beauty  of  nature  --  of  having  the  descriptions  at  various  levels, be  rather  similar  --  all  goes  down  to  the  idea  that  the  elementary  particles  are  both  sticky  and  Standoffish  and  They're  in  violent  motion  
Not  because  it  Wasn't  beautiful  or  anything, but  because  it  misses  the  thing  that  most  students  fail  to  understand  about  molecular  biology, and  that  is, why  is  there  any  probability  at  all  of  two  complex  shapes  finding  each  other  just  the  right  way?
So  they  had  created  these  artifacts  
So  That's, what  lauren  did  
Each  time, i  click  it  car.
Teacher, [choose]  objects  that  you  think  will  fall  to  the  earth  at  the  same  time.
Who's  got  the  apple  
We've  done  that  already  
Galileo, by  the  way, did  this  very  cleverly  by  running  a  ball  backwards  down  the  strings  of  his  Lute  
I'm  focusing  on  biology, the  biological  sciences, 
And  thereby  hangs  a  tale  
You  just  have  to  look  at  the  human  genome  project  
We're  reading  the  book  of  life  
On  the  way  there  It's  going  to  completely  revolutionize  medicine  and  health  care, That's  obvious, 
What  We're  doing  is  we  are  Seizing  control  of  our  evolutionary  future.
That  is  going  to  be  the  it  challenge  of  the  next  generation  is  communicating.
We're  sort  of  Circumventing  evolutionary  programs  that  guide  our  behavior  
It  Didn't  happen.
And  pretty  soon  It's  going  to  be  possible  to  avoid  virtually  all  genetic  diseases  in  that  way, 
Directly  going  in  --  It's  a  little  bit  further  away, but  not  that  far  away  --  going  in  and  altering  the  genes  in  the  first  cell  in  an  embryo  
People  can  try  and  ban  these  things  
Other  people  are  going  to  say, this  is  great  
And  from  the  beginning  of  Today's  sessions, You'd, think  that  They're  going  to  see  this  as  this  horrible  difficult  painful  period  that  we  struggled  through  
And  i  Don't  think  That's  What's  going  to  happen.
They  are  going  to  think  about  it  as  this  glorious  instant  when  we  laid  down  the  very  foundations  of  their  lives  of  their  society  of  their  future.
I  have  a  daughter  Mulan  
It's  our  own  pond  and  That's  how  it  happens.
I  know, 
She's  like  what  and  she  goes, but  mom, but  men  and  women  Can't  ever  see  each  other  naked, mom, 
Human  males  and  females  develop  a  special  bond. And  when  They're  much  older  much  much  older  than  you  and  they  have  a  very  special  feeling, then  they  can  be  naked  together.
I  Don't  understand  the  legs  
Well, the  internet  has  empowered  us  
And  as  he  came  the  second  day, i  thought, wow, That's, really  a  cartoon  lover.
You  will  not  like  it  
This  looks  like  a  giant  hamburger  
I  was  there  to  report  on  that  story  in  cartoons, 
I  said, well, maybe  we  Don't  have  time  for  this  right  now.
Show  the  positive  power  of  cartoons  
And  I've  been  doing  projects  like  this  in  2009, in  lebanon, this  year  in  kenya, back  in  january  ,
So  this  was  a  great  project  
So  i  want  to  start  out  with  this  beautiful  picture  from  my  childhood  
If  you  go  back  two  billion  years, You're, not  on  an  earth-like  planet, any  more  
What  we  call  an  earth-like  planet  is  actually  a  very  short  interval  of  time.
We  are  right  now  in  the  beautiful  Oreo  of  existence  --  of  at  least  life  on  planet  earth  --  following  the  first  horrible  microbial  age  
We  have  as  much  time  for  animals  to  exist  on  this  planet, as  they  have  been  here  now, till  we  hit  the  second  microbial  age  
And  That's  the  fate  of  a  planet, too  
All  along, it  was  thought  to  be  either  an  act  of  god, or  perhaps  long, slow  climate  change.
A  10-kilometer  body  hit  the  planet  
This  is  a  Gorgonopsian  or  a  Gorgon  
But  There's  lots  of  stuff, 
This  is  called  Paleontological  child, abuse  
And  the  what  i  think  is  that  we  returned  over  and  over  again  to  the  Pre-cambrian  world  that  first  microbial  age, and  the  microbes  are  still  out  there.
And  the  last  three  years  have  seen  an  enormous  breakthrough  in  a  brand-new  field, 
We  had  these  hydrogen  sulfide  oceans  for  a  very  great  long  period.
This  is  a  tracking  experiment.
This  is  a  great  white  shark  that  ate  some  of  my  traps  
We  pulled  it  up  up.
Tried  to  figure  out  how  to  save  americans  after  battlefield  injuries  
Now, the  same  mouse  is  given  80  parts  per  million  hydrogen  sulfide  in  this  solid  graph, and  look  what  happens  to  its  temperature.
Do  we  all  have  to  have  a  little  button  saying, let  me  die.
So  what  We're  looking  at  now, does  it  leave  a  signal  
It's  simultaneously, an  incredible  medical  technique, but  also  a  terrifying  
This  cell  phone  started  its  trajectory  in  an  artisanal  mine  in  the  eastern  congo.
And  all  of  those  products  probably  end  their  lives  in  a  dump  like  this  one  in  manila  
Some  of  these  governance  gaps  are  run  by  rogue  states.
But  right  now, most  of  the  companies  involved  in  these  supply  chains, Don't  have  any  way  of  Assuring  us  that  nobody  had  to  mortgage  their  future.
Now, i  Didn't  come  here  to  Depress.
It's, a  pharmaceutical  product  
You  expect  that  the  supply  chain  that  gets  it  to  the  hospital  probably  Squeaky, clean  
So  a  couple  of  years  ago, we  had  a  scandal  which  killed  about  80  people  around  the  world  because  of  contaminants  that  Crept  into  the  heparin  supply  chain.
And  the  Usfda  has  a  Jurisdictional  problem.
But  they  are  extremely  efficient  organizations.
You  can  call  yourself  responsible, but  responsibility  without  accountability, often  Doesn't  work  
Just  look  at  pandemics  --  swine  flu  bird  flu, H1n1, ,
There  are  thousands  of  suppliers  in  there.
It  seems  too  daunting  too  dangerous  for  any  company  to  take  on  
Please  ask  them  to  treat  us  like  human  beings, 
So  i  appeal  to  you  
Okay, There's  a  few  Heartbreaks  that  chocolate  Can't  fix  
Your  voice  is  small, but  Don't  ever  stop  singing.
But  there  are  plenty  of  things.
Spoken  word: poetry  is  the  art  of  performance, poetry, 
And  step  three  began  when  i  realized  that  i  Didn't  have  to  write  poems  that  were  indignant, if  That's  not  what  i  was  
And  actually  phil  Kaye, and  i  coincidentally  also  share  the  same  last  name.
And  the  first  list  that  i  assign  is  10  things, i  know  to  be  true  
At  a  certain  point, you  would  realize  that  someone  has  the  exact  same  thing  or  one  thing  very  similar  to  something  on  your  list.
And  fourth  someone  has  something  you  thought  you  knew  everything  about  but  They're  introducing  a  new  angle  of  looking  at  it.
And  i  said, charlotte, it  sounds  pretty  interesting  to  me.
Somebody  once  told  me  It's  like  walking  through  life, like  this  
And  what  was  left  of  the  city  soon  followed  
The  Long-lasting  damage  of  nuclear  radiation  caused  an  entire  city  and  its  population  to  turn  into  powder  
But  in  hiroshima, some  people  were  wiped  clean  away, leaving  only  a  wristwatch  or  a  diary  page.
In  the  original  story, god  told  sarah, she  could  do  something  impossible. And  she  laughed  because  the  first  sarah, she  Didn't  know  what  to  do  with  impossible.
But  on  the  front  step, a  person  who  was  sitting  there  blocked  the  rays  from  hitting  the  stone  
They  not  only  recorded  history. They  helped  change  the  course  of  history.
And  as  a  reaction, it  stimulates  public  opinion  and  gives  impetus  to  public  debate, thereby  preventing  the  interested  parties  from  totally  controlling  the  agenda  much  as  they  would  like  to  
That  was  a  tradition.
Seeing  the  war  created  such  incredibly  high  stakes  for  everyone  involved, and  that  visual  journalism  could  actually  become  a  factor  in  conflict  resolution  --  i  wanted  to  be  a  photographer  in  order  to  be  a  war  photographer  
In  1981, i  went  to  northern  ireland, 
During  the  early  '80s, i  spent  a  lot  of  time  in  central  america, which  was  engulfed  by  civil  wars  that  Straddled  the  ideological  divide  of  the  cold  war.
He  literally  had  nothing, he  was  a  virtual  skeleton  yet.
He  had  not  given  up, and  if  he  Didn't  give  up, how  could  anyone  in  the  outside  world  ever  dream  of  losing  hope?
An  aluminum  factory  in  Czechoslovakia  was  filled  with  carcinogenic  smoke  and  dust  and  four  out  of  five  workers  came  down  with  cancer.
When  the  story  was  published  Unsolicited  donations, poured  in  
I  tried  to  tell  the  story  through  the  work  of  caregivers  
I  thought  it  was  important  to  emphasize  that  people  were  being  helped  whether  by  international  ngos, or  by  local  grassroots  organizations.
The  international  community, still  Hasn't  found  a  way  to  create  the  pressure  necessary  to  stop  this  genocide.
I'd  been  photographing  in  the  islamic  world  since  1981  --  not  only  in  the  middle  east.
For  the  first  time  in  years  Shi'ites  were  allowed  to  make  the  pilgrimage  to  Karbala  to  observe  Ashura. And  i  was  amazed  by  the  sheer  number  of  people.
The  spirit, they  displayed  was  absolutely  remarkable  
Photographers  go  to  the  extreme  edges  of  human  experience  to  show  people  What's  going  on  
And  therefore, i  will  limit  myself  to  only  talk  about  the  links  between  religion  and  sexuality  
So  i  will  talk  of  what  i  remember  as  the  most  wonderful  
It's  when  the  young  couple  whisper  tonight, we  are  going  to  make  a  baby  
Will  the  number  of  children  increase  each  year  up  to  15  years, or  will  it  continue  in  the  same  fast  rate  and  be  four  billion  children  up  there?
So  bear  with  our  simplicity.
And  here, the  income  per  person  in  comparable  dollars  
Otherwise  it  was  only  christian  countries.
And  by  2010, we  are  actually  80  percent  of  humans  who  live  in  countries  with  about  two  children  per  woman  
But  30  years  from  now, afghanistan  will  go  from  30  million  to  60  million  
It's, an  amazing  improvement  from  seven  children  per  woman, They've  gone, all  the  way  down  to  between  four  and  five  
Well, i  do  as  i  always  do  
I  went  to  the  statistical  authority  of  qatar  to  their  webpage  --  It's, a  very  good  webpage. I   recommend  it  --  and  i  looked  up  --  oh, yeah, you  can  have  lots  of  fun  here  --  and  provided  free  of  charge. I   found  Qatar's  social  trends.
Now, look, again  at  this  
So  what  will  happen  now  is  quite  straightforward  
Most  of  us  have  to  trust  that  that  happens  correctly  for  our  own  vote. And  we  all  have  to  trust  that  that  happens  correctly  for  all  the  votes  in  the  election.
So  this  is  how  you  vote  
So  you  let  a  poll  station  worker  scan  your  encrypted  vote, 
And  these  are  elections  by  the  people  for  the  people.
I  was  in  india  this  past  year, and  i  may  have  seen  the  last  cases  of  polio  in  the  world.
And  he  made  an  outrageous  prediction  that  smallpox  would  be  eradicated, and  that  this  was  God's  gift  to  humanity, because  of  the  hard  work  of  dedicated  scientists  
Audience, early  detection, early  response, 
And  india  was  the  place  where  smallpox  made  its  last  stand.
You  could  vaccinate  everybody  in  india. But  one  year  later, There'll  be  21  million  new  babies, which  was  then  the  population  of  canada.
We  had  a  Scorecard  that  we  wrote  on  every  house  
This  may  be  the  year  we  eradicate  polio  --  that  will  make  it  the  second  disease  in  history.
I  hope  that  you  will  take  a  look  at  it.
Would  you  get  in  an  airplane  with  250  people, you  Didn't  know  coughing  and  sneezing, when  you  knew  that  some  of  them  might  carry  a  disease  that  could  kill  you  for  which  you  had  no  Antivirals  or  vaccine  
I  asked  them  --  these  are  all  Fluologists  and  specialists  in  influenza  --  and  i  asked  them  the  questions  You'd  like  to  ask  them.
Within  three  weeks, it  will  be  everywhere  in  the  world.
Let's  increase  the  websites  that  they  crawl  from  20000  to  20  million  
Then  a  number  of  years  went  by, and  there  were  a  lot  of  rumors  about  bird  flu.
They  reported  this  to  who  who  took  a  little  while  taking  action, because  who  will  only  receive  a  report  from  a  government  because  It's  the  united  nations  
Now, What's, really  important  is  that  before  there  was  gphin  100  percent  of  all  the  World's  reports  of  bad  things  --  whether  You're  talking  about  famine  or  You're  talking  about  bird  flu  or  You're  talking  about  ebola  --  100  percent  of  all  those  reports  came  from  nations.
The  moment  these  guys  in  ottawa  on  a  budget  of  800000  dollars  a  year  got  cracking  75  percent  of  all  the  reports  in  the  world  came  from  gphin.
Now, Here's  What's, real  interesting, after  They'd  been  working  for  a  couple  years. What  do  you  think  happened  to  those  nations?
I  was  this  weird  little  kid  who  wanted  to  have  deep  talks  about  the  worlds  that  might  exist  beyond  the  ones  that  we  perceive  with  our  senses.
Take  a  breath  right  now  of  this  clear  air  in  this  room, 
They've  made  me  a  proud  I-don't-know-it-all  
And  we  used  some  guidelines  to  keep  our  conversation  elevated, and  you  can  use  them  too, because  i  know  You're  all  going  to  take  an  other  to  lunch  
My  lunch  partner, and  i  came  away  with  some  really  important  insights  and  I'm  going  to  share  just  one  with  you.
And  since  we  had  established  some  trust, we  believed  in  each  Other's, sincerity  
We  agreed  We'd, speak  up  in  our  own  communities.
Instead, we  had  taken  first  steps  together  past  our  Knee-jerk  reactions  to  the  ubuntu  place, which  is  the  only  place  where  solutions  to  our  most  Intractable-seeming  problems  will  be  found  
Because  ubuntu  work  is  slow  and  It's  difficult  .
It's, two  people, two  warriors, dropping  their  weapons.
In  my  life, when  i  tried  to  achieve  things  like  success  or  recognition, they  eluded  me  
And  it  is  for  me  a  language  which  expressed  the  intangible  and  gives  voice  to  people  and  stories  without  
Joshua  claims  to  have  personally  killed  more  than  10000  people  during  Liberia's  civil  war, 
But  what  i  saw  opened  my  eyes  to  an  idea  of  forgiveness, which  i  never  thought  possible  
I  was  intensely  moved  during  all  this  
And  yes, all  of  those  people  killed  were  male  
Many  of  the  women  are  married  with  children. And  they  say, the  hardest  part  of  their  deployment  was  being  kept  away  from  their  children.
And  when  i  asked  one  of  the  women  about  the  shock  and  awe  response, she  said, Don't  worry.
We  know  how  to  deal  with  these  fellows  and  ignored  them  
Sometimes  when  the  war  is  over  and  all  the  film  crews  have  left  the  most  inspiring  stories  are  the  ones  that  float  just  beneath  the  radar  
They  answer  more  than  5000  calls  in  just  two  months.
It  seems  that  this  story  helped  change  perceptions  about  the  dfs, at  least  in  the  minds  of  an  audience  in  part  on  televisions, read  magazines  and  whose  huts  Aren't  on  fire  
That's, right, yeah, very  rarely. Do  we  ever  know?
Wow, so  your  leak  really  substantially  changed  the  world  
Let  me  know  when  You've  got  them, Let's  shoot  
Hotel  Bushmaster, Two-six, Bushmaster  Two-six. We  need  to  move  time.
Two-six  this  is  Two-six  We're, mobile, ,
What  was  the  key  element  of  this  that  actually  caused  the  outrage?
I  mean, in  general  What's, your  philosophy, 
We  have  a  way  of  dealing  with  information  that  has  sort  of  personal  --  personally  identifying  information  in  it.
Yeah, we  do  get  a  lot  of  that  
But  do  you  see  any  irony  in  the  fact  that  in  order  for  you  to  shine  that  light, you  have  to  yourself, create  secrecy  around  your  sources.
You  know, there  might  be  a  couple  of  views  of  wikileaks  and  of  julian  
So  late  last  year  --  in  november, last  year  --  there  was  a  series  of  well  Blowouts  in  albania  like  the  well  blowout  in  the  gulf  of  mexico.
So  under  that  basis, we  put  it  out  and  said, look, We're  skeptical  about  this  thing.
I  mean, We're  an  organization  that  is  hard  to  grow  very  quickly, because  of  the  sort  of  material  we  deal  with. So  we  have  to  Restructure  in  order  to  have  people  who  will  deal  with  the  highest  national  security  stuff.
Can  that  be  right  
And  you  were  also  --  i  mean, you  were  also  a  hacker  at  an  early  age, and  ran  into  the  authorities  early  on  
So  this  phrase  is  not  not  as  nice  as  it  used  to  be  
So  just  tell  us  very  quickly  in  the  last  minute, the  story, what  happened  in  iceland?
Instead, they  Publicized  your  side, 
However, no  studies  exist  yet  that  show  how  or  why  
But  then  one  night, my  mom  was  cooking, grilled  chicken  for  dinner.
And  later  in  biology  class, i  learned  that  It's  due  to  a  process  called  Denaturing, which  is  where  the  proteins  will  change  shape  and  lose  their  ability  to  chemically  function.
I  was  the  17-18  year-old  age  category  winner, and  then  the  grand  prize  winner  
And  that  was  my  first  science  fair  project  
My  parents  suffered  through  many  more  of  my  science  fair  projects, including  a  remote, controlled  garbage  can  
And  That's, huge  
So  that  was  my  work, and  it  was  my  way  of  Reimagining  the  future  for  future  research  with  figuring  out  exactly  what  this  protein  does, but  also  for  the  future  of  chemotherapy  effectiveness  --  so  maybe  all  grandfathers  with  cancer  have  a  little  bit  more  time  to  spend  with  their  grandchildren  
But  soon, after  i  developed  a  novel  mathematical  model  that  essentially  Quantifies  the  effect  of  these  environmental  pollutants  on  the  lung  health  of  asthmatic  patients, 
And  it  surprises  me  that  no  model  currently  exists  that  Quantifies  the  effect  of  environmental  factors  on  human  lung  health, because  that  relationship  seems  so  important  
Because  i  realized  that  if  we  could  find  a  way  to  target  Remediation, we  could  also  find  a  way  to  treat  asthmatic  patients  more  effectively, 
These  chemical  pollutants  are  currently  not  a  criteria  air  pollutant  as  defined  by  the  us, clean  air  act, 
So  any  user  can  come  in  here  and  click  on  lung  function  report  and  It'll  take  them  to  this  report  that  i  created  
My  translation  medium  is  a  very  simple  basket  
That  means  that  it  is  the  numbers  that  control  the  form, not  me  
I  use  these  scores  to  collaborate  with  musicians, 
This  piece  here  is  read  very  differently, depending  on  where  you  place  it  
You  place  it  in  a  science  museum, it  becomes  a  three-dimensional  visualization  of  data.
So  after  being  interrogated  by  this  japanese  manager  for  a  half  an  hour, he  finally  said  so  miss  yang: do  you  have  any  questions  to  ask  me?
And  sometimes  i  have  young  people  approaching  me, say, Lan, you  changed  my  life, and  i  feel  proud  of  that  .
So  it  means  young  couples  will  have  to  support  four  parents  who  have  a  life  expectancy  of  73  years  old  
So  making  a  living  is  not  that  easy  for  young  people.
And  for  those  who  are  ready  to  get  married  and  buy  their  apartment, they  figured  out  they  have  to  work  for  30  to  40  years  to  afford  their  first  apartment.
For  those  who  do  return  back  to  the  countryside, they  find  themselves  very  welcome  locally. Because  with  the  knowledge  skills  and  networks, they  have  learned  in  the  cities  with  the  assistance  of  the  internet, They're  able  to  create  more  jobs  upgrade, local  agriculture  and  create  new  business  in  the  less  developed  market.
And  after  hours  of  negotiation, 500  dogs  were  rescued  
And  here  also  people  are  helping  to  find  missing  children  
I  guess  these  are  the  questions  people  are  going  to  answer  
And  our  younger  generation  are  going  to  transform  this  country, while  at  the  same  time, being  transformed  themselves  
They  only  learn  to  be  frightened  of  those  differences  when  an  adult  influences  them  to  behave  that  way  and  maybe  censors  that  natural  curiosity, or  you  know, reins  in  the  Question-asking, in  the  hopes  of  them, being  polite  little  kids  
The  doors  open, the  kids, descend  on  this  table  of  legs, and  they  are  poking  and  Prodding  and  They're  Wiggling  toes  and  They're  trying  to  put  their  full  weight  on  the  sprinting  leg  to  see  what  happens  with  that  
And  immediately  a  voice  Shouted  kangaroo, ,
And  then  one  eight-year-old  said, hey, why  Wouldn't  you  want  to  fly  too  
So  this  magazine  through  the  hands  of  graphic  designer, peter  Saville, went  to  fashion  designer, alexander  Mcqueen  and  photographer  nick  knight, who  were  also  interested  in  exploring  that  conversation.
Today  i  have  over  a  dozen  pair  of  prosthetic  legs  that  various  people  have  made  for  me  and  with  them, i  have  different  negotiations  of  the  terrain  under  my  feet, and  i  can  change  my  height  --  i  have  a  variable  of  five  different  heights.
Today, I'm, 6'1  
It's  a  conversation  about  augmentation  
As  lord  Blackstone  described, it  land  is  protected  by  trespass  law  for  most  of  the  history  of  trespass  law  by  Presuming.
And  bmi  was  much  more  democratic  in  the  art  that  it  would  include  within  its  repertoire, including  african  american  music  for  the  first  time  in  the  repertoire  
In  my  view, the  most  significant  thing  to  recognize  about  what  this  internet  is  doing  is  its  opportunity  to  revive  the  read-write  culture  that  sousa  Romanticized  
White  europeans  were  subject  to  the  plague  
We  can  date  it  to  700  years  ago.
And  if  You're  thinking  of  efficient  information  storage  mechanisms, it  may  not  turn  out  to  be  chips.
We're  just  beginning  this  journey  of  life  in  the  new  zoo.
And  you  can  do  strange  things  with  this  stuff.
Now, the  last  of  these  things  died  in  september  1936, 
And  if  we  do  that  and  insert  this  into  a  fertilized  Wolf's  egg, we  may  give  birth  to  an  animal  that  Hasn't  walked  the  earth  since  1936  
The  really  neat  thing  about  this  stuff  is  That's  life.
And  in  the  measure  that  we  learn  how  chickens  grow  wings  and  what  the  program  is  for  those  cells  to  differentiate  one  of  the  things  We're  going  to  be  able  to  do  is  to  stop  Undifferentiated  cells, which, you  know  as  cancer.
That's, why  sometimes  a  Person's  genes  Don't  have  to  change  a  lot  to  get  cancer  
Same  thing  with  Receptin, if  You've  got  breast  cancer  
And  you  can  watch  states, rise  and  fall, depending  on  their  ability  to  speak  a  language  of  life. And  you  can  watch  new  york  fall  off  a  cliff, and  you  can  watch  new  jersey  fall  off  a  cliff, and  you  can  watch  the  rise  of  the  new  empires  of  intelligence.
That's, why  nations  rise  and  fall  
In  the  1990s, these  are  sovereign  states  that  did  not  exist  before  1990.
And  when  noah  had  done  built  his  ark, i  understand  that  somebody  began  to  Rend  a  song  
And  the  old  lady  said, oh, yes, come  on  in  
It  was  great  
It's  really  amazing  
If  you  want  to  know  about  africa, read  our  literature  --  and  not  just  things  fall  apart, because  that  would  be  like  saying, I've  read  'gone  with  the  Wind'. And  so  i  know  everything  about  america.
We've  had  a  lot  of  --  a  parade  of  amazing  ideas  here, 
But  Harry's  wife  is  confused  because  she  said, you  know, harry  had  been  packing  his  own  lunch  for  20  years.
So  i  had  a  very  inventive  teacher, a  pakistani  muslim  who  wanted  to  teach  us  about  this  
I  mean  picture  this  --  really  picture  this  
We  are  Squandering  the  most  valuable  resource.
And  we  want  to  say  to  idris, chop  him  up  
Shut  him  up  
The  question  is, how  do  i  balance  narratives  that  are  wonderful  with  narratives  of  wounds  and  Self-loathing  
As  a  young, middle-class  nigerian  activist, i  launched  myself  along  with  a  whole  generation  of  us  into  the  campaign  to  stop  the  government  
I  justified  it. And  i  said, this  is  the  cost  of  revolution.
Have  i  not  myself  been  imprisoned  
And  so  they  said, tell  me  about  africa, professor  Abani  
There  are  no  essential  africans. And  most  of  us  are  as  completely  ignorant  as  everyone  else  about  the  continent  we  come  from. And  yet  we  want  to  make  profound  statements  about  it.
Gazelle  i  killed  you  for  your  Skin's, exquisite  touch  for  how  easy  it  is  to  be  nailed  to  a  board.
Rise  and  walk  away  like  a  Panther  
Also  the  person  sitting  in  your  very  seats  is  a  liar  
I  watch  that  tv  show  'lie  to  Me', i  know  You're  lying  ,
They  use  it  to  get  to  the  truth, and  they  do  what  mature  leaders  do  everyday.
Its  power  emerges  when  someone  else  agrees  to  believe  the  lie  
Deception  is  actually  serious  business.
It's  woven  into  the  fabric  of  our  daily  and  our  business  lives, 
Koko  was  taught  to  communicate  via  sign  language.
And  i  need  to  go  back  to  work  for  the  american  people.
Now, if  bill  clinton  had  said, well  to  tell  you  the  truth  or  richard  Nixon's  favorite  in  all  Candor, he  would  have  been  a  dead  Giveaway  for  any  Liespotter  than  knows  that  qualifying  language  as  It's  called  qualifying  language, like  that  further  Discredits  the  subject  
Freud  had  it  right  
With  body  language, Here's, what  You've  got  to  do  
Now, We're  going  to  look  at  the  hot  spots  
We  say, yes, we  shake  our  heads, no  
And  We're  going  to  see  that  in  several  videos, moving  forward, but  We're  going  to  start  --  for  those  of  you  who  Don't  know  him. This  is  presidential  candidate.
But  I'm  happy  to  participate  in  one  
It's  the  only  asymmetrical  expression, 
And  these  were  Surfaced  by  researcher, david  Matsumoto  in  california, 
And  You'll  see  when  you  see  the  video, she  Can't  even  pretend  to  be  an  agonizing  mother  
Diane  downs  at  night  when  i  close  my  eyes, i  can  see  christie. Reaching  her  hand  out  to  me  while  I'm  driving  and  the  blood  just  kept  coming  out  of  her  mouth.
Now, I'm  going  to  show  you  a  video  of  an  actual  grieving, mother  Erin, Runnion, confronting  her  Daughter's  murderer  and  Torturer  in  court  
Now, the  technology  around  what  the  truth  looks  like  is  progressing  on  the  science  of  it  
I  do  now, after  learning  about  all  the  quantum  stuff, 
They  fight, they  get  back  up, you  know, Wouldn't  this  be  cool  
This  is  a  clay  maker, 
You  know, how  --  why  would  a  kid  want  a  dinosaur  
You  can  see  how  old  this  stuff  is  
And  I'm  really  not  very  good  at  it.
This  is  a  --  you  can  see  the  little  window  there  
So  this  is  a  quick  tale  I'm  going  to  tell. This  is  the  furby  tale.
So  this  is  my  family  
I  try  to  do  a  lot  of  philosophy.
You  can  see  the  little  Bb  in  the  box  is  my  tilt  sensor  
I  just  basically  Gnawed  all  this  stuff  out  of  plastic  
He  Didn't  test  so  well, but  i  like  him, 
And  then  she  started  doing  these  other  images, 
I  have  three  girls  and  they  just  they  --  It's  like  a  rescue  animal  thing, They're  going  there.
And  on  the  weekend, we  ran  the  parts  for  that  
So  this  is  how  they  come  out  close  to  the  end.
For  a  while  they  were  making  two  million  furbys  a  month  
And  she  still  actually  has  those  
And  We're  going  to  try  to  really  pull  this  off  Intentfully.
And  you  could  actually  find  full  fossil  evidence  of  these  
Very  very  obsessive  
And  then  more  sculpting  and  then  more  sculpting  and  then  more  sculpting, and  then  more  sculpting, 
John  do  you  want  to  bring  him  up  
Yeah, They're  like  kids, you  know, 
That's, what  the  investors  think  that  It's  just  --  --  right, right?
Now, these  are  not  robots  They're  kind  of  Lovebots.
We  --  actually  It's  very  hard  to  keep  people  from  doing  this  
And  There's  a  lot  of  social  responsibility  in  that  
If  they  can  do  that, why  Can't  governments  and  ngos  do  the  same  thing  
So  That's, why  i  took  a  bit  of  time  to  study  coke  
They  have  this  very  continuous  feedback  loop: 
They  said, you  roll  the  ball, you  hear  some  pins, go  down  
It's  dark, you  Can't  see  which  one  goes  down  until  the  lights  come  on.
Real-time; data; turns  on  the  lights  
They  set  them  up  as  what  they  called  Micro-distribution  centers  and  those  local  entrepreneurs  then  hire  sales  people  who  go  out  with  bicycles  and  Pushcarts  and  Wheelbarrows  to  sell  the  product  
The  government  noticed  in  ethiopia, that  many  of  the  people  were  so  far  away  from  a  health  clinic, they  were  over  a  Day's  travel  away  from  a  health  clinic.
The  third  component  of  Coke's  success  is  marketing  
Let's, listen  to  this  song  that  coke  created  for  it  Wavin'  flag  by  a  somali, hip, hop  artist  
And  it  went  number  one  on  the  pop  chart  in  17  countries.
I've  even  seen  it  used  for  a  chicken  coop  
We  know  that  circumcision  reduces  hiv  infection  by  60  percent  in  men, 
But  it  turns  out  the  men  do  because  They're  hearing  from  their  girlfriends  that  they  prefer  it. And  the  men  also  believe  it  improves  their  sex  life.
So  What's, the  endgame  
So  if  Coke's  marketers  came  to  me  and  asked  me  to  define  happiness, I'd, say, my  vision  of  happiness  is  a  mother  holding  healthy  baby  in  her  arms  
To  me  that  is  deep  happiness.
Thank  you  
This  is  my  baseline.
This  is  their  baseline.
What  have  we  learned  from  these  places?
When  we  went  to  pristine  reefs, we  realized  that  the  natural  world  was  upside  down. This  pyramid  was  inverted  .
The  top  head  does  account  for  most  of  the  biomass  in  some  places  up  to  85  percent  like  Kingman  reef, which  is  now  protected.
Then  you  go  to  palmyra  Atoll  that  has  more  biomass  of  herbivores  and  the  dead  corals  are  clean. And  the  corals  are  coming  back.
And  this  is  what  i  saw  lots  of  fish  
And  this  particular  place, the  medes  islands  marine  reserve  is  only  94  hectares. And  it  brings  6  million  euros  to  the  local  economy, 20  times  more  than  fishing.
These  places  when  we  protect  them, if  we  compare  them  to  unprotected  areas  nearby. This  is  what  happens  .
The  abundance, how  many  fish  you  have  per  square  meter  increases, almost  170  percent  
If  you  fish  less  You're, actually  catching  more  
Another  example, Nassau  groupers  in  Belize  in  the  Mesoamerican  reef.
When  i  went  there  for  the  first  time  in  2000, there  were  only  3000  groupers  left  
It  happened  in  many  places  around  the  caribbean  
So  how  much  of  this  do  we  have  
People  are  losing  their  jobs  because  the  fisheries  are  collapsing  
The  problem  is  that  we  can  create  these  large  reserves, only  in  places  where  there  are  no  people  where  there  is  no  social  conflict, where  the  political  cost  is  really  low.
But  what  about  the  rest  of  the  coast  of  the  world  where  people  live  and  make  a  living  out  of  fishing  
How  could  85  percent  survive  on  15  percent  
The  animals  at  the  lower  parts  of  the  food  chain, they  reproduce  very  fast. They  grow  really  fast.
So  really  our  picture  of  a  food  pyramid  is  just  --  we  have  to  change  that  completely  
We  think  this  is  universal  
So  the  numbers  you  presented  really  are  astonishing  
Talk  to  me  about  the  feeling  that  you  must  have  experienced  of  going  to  these  pristine  areas  and  seeing  things  coming  back  
And  if  it  were  not  for  these  places  that  show  hope, i  Don't  think  i  could  continue  doing  this  job.
And  the  problem, i  think, is  that  we  take  the  ocean  for  granted.
Most  of  the  animals  are  in  the  oceans.
We  use  the  submarine  alvin, and  we  use  cameras  and  the  cameras  are  something  that  bill  lange  has  developed  with  the  help  of  sony  
Marcel  Proust  said, the  true  voyage  of  discovery  is  not  so  much  in  seeking  new  landscapes  as  in  having  new  eyes.
It's  got  tentacles  dangling  swirling  around  like  that.
And  these  are  the  types  of  animals  that  live  in  that  three-dimensional  space  that  Micro-gravity  environment  that  we  really  Haven't  explored  
They're  very  little  understood  
They  go  from  a  couple  of  inches  to  a  couple  of  feet  
It's  footage  that  We've  collected  for  scientific  purposes.
And  We're  over  the  atlantic  --  That's  the  ridge  right  there  --  but  We're  going  to  go  across  the  caribbean, central  america  and  end  up  against  the  pacific  nine  degrees, north  
Here's  where  Bill's  cameras  really  do  shine  
And  what  You're  seeing  here  is  a  cloud  of  densely  packed  Hydrogen-sulfide-rich  water  coming  out  of  a  volcanic  axis  on  the  sea  floor.
Not  only  is  it  coming  out  of  the  earth  --  so  Biogenesis  made  from  volcanic  activity  --  but  that  bacteria  supports  these  colonies  of  life  
A  mile  and  a  half  from  the  surface  to  two  miles  to  three  miles  --  no  sun  has  ever  gotten  down  here.
Oh  good, going  
This  is  a  female  of  this  kind  of  worm  
You  watch  it  Doesn't  take  long  before  two  guys  here  --  this  one  and  one  that  will  show  up  over  here  --  start  to  fight  
The  red  dot  is  the  laser  light  of  the  submarine. Alvin  to  give  us  an  idea  about  how  far  away  we  are  from  the  vents.
It's  actually  a  Light-sensing  organ  
This  One's  several  stories  tall, 
This  stuff  is  toxic  as  hell  by  the  way.
That's  probably  where  we  evolved  from  
There's  a  fish  sitting  here  
Here's  a  crab  with  his  claw, right  at  the  end  of  that  tube  worm, waiting  for  that  worm  to  stick  his  head  out.
The  worms  are  growing  inches  per  week.
Despite  that  these  animals  grow  back  in  about  a  Year's  time, 
Learn  to  manage  it, 
So  I'd  like  to  talk  about  why  that  is  why  That's  such  a  Calamity  for  society, what  we  can  do  about  it  and  to  close  with  why?
This  is  really  destructive  
David  Milch  creator  of  Deadwood.
You  expect  Sitcom-sized  problems  that  wrap  up  in  22  minutes, three  commercial  breaks  and  a  laugh  track  
In  all  seriousness, Here's  an  example  from  a  physics.
I'm  sure, we  all  agree  that  no  problem  worth  solving  is  like  that  
So  i  can  diagnose  the  problem, a  little  more  specifically  in  math  
The  math  serves  the  conversation: the  conversation  Doesn't  serve  the  math  
I  like  this  question, It's  about  a  water  tank  
I've  got  kids  who  are  mathematically  and  Conversationally  Intimidated  joining  the  conversation.
We  need  more  patient  problem  solvers.
Because  actually  radical  innovation  does  sometimes  come  from  the  very  best, but  it  often  comes  from  places  where  you  have  huge  need  --  unmet  latent  demand  --  and  not  enough  resources  for  traditional  solutions  to  work  --  traditional  High-cost  solutions, which  depend  on  professionals, which  is  what  schools  and  hospitals  are  .
We'll  grow  by  six  cities  of  12  million  people  a  year  for  the  next  30  years.
This  is  where  You'll  find  the  fastest  growing  young  populations  of  the  world  
Or  you  can  go  to  places  like  this  
This  is  kibera, which  is  the  largest  slum  in  east  africa.
Millions  of  people  living  here  stretched  over  many  kilometers, 
They're, private  schools. There  are  no  state  schools  in  slums.
It's  not  to  do  with  electricity  or  water.
If  you  want  to  design  from  scratch  virtually  any  service  in  africa, you  would  start  now  with  the  mobile  phone  
This  is  a  place  called  the  Madangiri  settlement  colony, which  is  a  very  developed  slum  about  25  minutes  outside  new  delhi, where  i  met  these  characters  who  showed  me  around  for  the  day.
Ten  years  ago, they  certainly  would  have  been  married  
This  is  the  best  you  can  get  in  hyderabad  in  indian  education, 
But  they  find  it  completely  obvious  to  use  computers  websites, make  videos  so  on  and  so  forth.
One  is  to  deliver  extrinsic  motivation  that  education  has  a  payoff  
That's  too  long, if  You're  poor  
So  you  need  education  to  be  relevant  and  help  people  to  make  a  living  there, and  then  often  
Our  education  systems  you  do  all  that  stuff  afterward.
So  el  sistema  in  venezuela  uses  a  violin  as  a  technology  of  learning  
Taio  Rocha  uses  making  soap  as  a  technology  of  learning  
And  i  learned  it  from  this  guy  who  is  an  amazing  character  
And  it  also  supports  working-class  kids  going  into  indian  schools.
And  It's  the  same, wherever  you  go  
It's  reliable  and  people  know  exactly  where  they  are  
Why  Can't  we  do  it  more  like  the  chinese  restaurants, 
There  are  big  picture  schools  in  the  us  and  australia, 
But  because  so  many  of  the  issues  in  education, Aren't  just  in  school  They're  in  family  and  community, what  you  also  need  definitely  is  more  on  the  right  hand  side.
You  need  efforts  to  supplement  schools.
That's  an  entire  second  adult  lifetime, That's  been  added  to  our  lifespan  
But  many  people  today  --  philosophers  artists, doctors  scientists  --  are  taking  a  new  look  at  what  i  call  the  third  act, the  last  three  decades  of  life, 
They  realize  that  this  is  actually  a  developmental  stage  of  life  with  its  own  significance  --  as  different  from  Midlife  as  adolescence  is  from  childhood  
I've  spent  the  last  year  researching  and  writing  about  this  subject.
Obviously  There's, no  guarantee  that  it  can  be  a  time  of  fruition  and  growth  
It  was  about  a  man  named  neil  Selinger  --  57  years, old, a  retired  lawyer  --  who  had  joined  the  writers  group  at  sarah  lawrence  where  he  found  his  Writer's.
It's  a  terrible  disease, It's, fatal  ,
If  however, we  can  go  back  and  alter  our  relationship, Re-vision  our  relationship  to  past  people  and  events, neural  pathways  can  change  
I  mean, as  girls, we  start  off  feisty  --  yeah, who  says, 
We  have  agency  
But  very  often, many, if  not  most  of  us  when  we  hit  puberty, we  start  worrying  about  fitting  in  and  being  popular  
Thank  you  very  much  
But  most  species  actually  use  insects  to  do  their  bidding  and  That's  more  intelligent  in  a  way  because  the  pollen, they  Don't  need  so  much  of  it.
The  insects  and  other  species  can  take  the  pollen  transfer  it  directly  to  where  It's  required  
There  are  markings  on  many  plants  that  look  like  other  insects  
These  are  the  Anthers  of  a  lily  cleverly  done  so  that  when  the  Unsuspecting  insect  lands  on  it, the  Anther  flips  up  and  Whops  it  on  the  back  with  a  great  load  of  pollen  that  it  then  goes  to  another  plant  with  
And  basically  what  the  insect  has  to  do  --  We're  in  the  middle  of  the  flower  --  it  has  to  stick  its  little  proboscis  right  into  the  middle  of  that, and  all  the  way  down  that  nectar  tube  to  get  to  the  nectar  
So  not  only  has  the  fly, not  got  the  nectar  from  the  mimic  plant. It's  also  --  if  you  look  very  closely, just  at  the  head  end, you  can  see  that  It's  got  a  bit  of  pollen  that  it  would  be  transmitting  to  another  plant.
And  when  the  insect  gets  there  and  lands  on  it  Dousing  itself  in  pollen, of  course, that  It's  going  to  take  to  another  plant. If  you  look  at  the  Every-home-should-have-one  scanning  electron  microscope  picture, you  can  see  that  there  are  actually  some  patterning  there, which  is  three-dimensional  .
Sometimes  the  whole  plant  mimics  an  insect, even  to  us  
So  flies  love, this  
They  lay  their  eggs  in  it  thinking, It's  a  nice  bit  of  carrion  and  not  realizing  that  There's, no  food  for  the  eggs  that  the  eggs  are  going  to  die. But  the  plant, meanwhile  has  benefited  because  the  Bristles  release  and  the  flies  disappear  to  pollinate.
This  thing  does  something  else, which  is  unusual  ,
Recently, a  wise  media  theorist  Tweeted, the  19th  century  culture  was  defined  by  the  novel. The  20th  century  culture  was  defined  by  the  cinema. And  the  culture  of  the  21st  century  will  be  defined  by  the  interface.
And  i  believe  this  is  going  to  prove  true  
And  That's  us  down  there  in  la  and  long  beach  on  the  bottom  
This  is  Baron: Wolfgang  von  Kempelen's, mechanical  chess, playing  machine, 
And  i  think  It's  a  pretty  valid  question: 
He  draws  sheep  after  sheep.
So  this  is  a  clip  from  charlie  Chaplin's, modern  times  
That's  all  I'm, getting  paid  for  this  
So  we  Resynthesized  this  song, 
And  then  You'd  do  your  best  to  recreate  that  with  your  own  voice  
After  Previewing  it  and  Confirming  It's, what  you  submitted, you  could  submit  it  into  the  mechanical  turk  with  no  other  context.
I'm, sorry, for  this  
And  this  was  seen  by  a  director  in  la  named  james  frost  who  said, wait  a  minute  
And  i  think  one  of  my  favorite  parts  of  this  project  was  not  just  shooting  a  video  with  lasers, but  we  also  open  sourced  it, and  we  made  it  released  as  a  google  code  project  where  people  could  download  a  bunch  of  the  data  and  some  source  code  to  build  their  own  versions  of  it.
So  we  thought  this  was  the  perfect  project  to  build  a  collaborative  memorial  and  a  virtual  resurrection  for  johnny  cash.
Collaborator  five  as  much  as  is  different  from  frame  to  frame, it  really  is  personal  
But  There's  a  bunch  of  different  styles  
There  is  a  real  problem  with  Snobbery  
Imagine  that  Snobbery  is  a  Distinctively  uk  phenomenon, fixated  on  country  houses  and  titles  
Snobbery  is  a  global  phenomenon.
Now, the  opposite  of  a  snob  is  your  mother  
Think  this  is  somebody  who  is  incredibly  vulnerable, and  in  need  of  love  
We're  told  from  many  sources  that  anyone  can  achieve  anything  
We  are  now  in  a  system  where  anyone  can  rise  to  any  position.
They  own  their  success, but  they  also  own  their  failure.
But  i  think  It's  insane  to  believe  that  we  will  ever  make  a  society  that  is  genuinely  meritocratic  It's, an  impossible  dream.
What  we  fear  is  the  judgment  and  ridicule  of  others, and  it  exists  
And  then  are  fit  for  ridicule  
Now, is  there  any  alternative  to  this  
And  That's  why  we  enjoy  looking  at  glaciers  and  oceans  and  contemplating  the  earth  from  outside  its  Perimeters, etc.
When  banking  is  no  longer  so  respectable, we  lose  interest  in  banking  
But  what  i  really  want  to  stress  is  by  all  means  success, yes, 
Because  the  emphasis  nowadays  is  so  much  on  the  justice  of  everything  and  politicians  always  talk  about  justice.
But  it  Doesn't  matter  that  much  that  We're  putting  too  much  emphasis  on  that  
Thank  you  very  much  
It's  a  smiling  face  
And  when  i  said, I'm  going  to  go  out  and  do  a  15-hour  swim  and  We're  coming  into  the  dock  after  a  long  day  and  It's  now  night, and  we  come  in  and  It's  14  hours  and  58  minutes, and  i  can  touch  the  dock  and  We're  done.
Try  going  in  with  an  armada, like  we  had  of  50  people  and  five  boats  and  Cnn's  crew, etc.
And  there  are  sharks  
And  i  gathered  together, honestly, the  World's  leading  experts  in  every  possible  way.
And  a  month  ago, the  23rd  of  september, i  stood  on  that  shore, and  i  looked  across  to  that  long, long, Faraway  horizon. And  i  asked  myself, do  you  have  it? ?
You're  really  left  alone  with  your  own  thoughts.
First  of  all  You're  going  to  hit  obstacles  
And  even  though  You're  feeling  great  at  any  one  moment, Don't, take  it  for  granted, be  ready  because  There's  going  to  be  pain  There's  going  to  be  suffering, 
After  a  couple  of  days  three  days, you  tend  to  rebel  in  a  lot  of  physical  ways.
I  Don't  know, if  you  can  still  see  the  red  line  here  and  up  the  arm  
He's, 29  years  old, very  Well-built. Lean  He's, Six-foot, five, weighs  265  lbs.
I  need  help, and  i  Can't  help, diana  
The  box  jelly  again  --  all  across  the  neck  all  across  here, 
We've  got  Benadryl  on  board.
And  they  have  these  long  30  to  40  to  50-ft  tentacles  
Henry  What's  your  question: ,
And  i  said, well, It's, odd  that  You've  learned  of  this  as  a  noble  kind  of  pursuit.
He  said, That's  what  you  need  
Thank  you  
This  hope  is  still  alive.
Are  you  going  to  swim  the  atlantic  
I  said, nope, i  Didn't  know, 
And  i  left  everything  and  went  for  a  long  series  of  odd  jobs  
They  come  in  a  lot  of  different  shapes.
So  I'm  always  looking  for  the  false  Cognates  or  identical  words  in  different  languages.
So  i  did  a  series  of  work  where  it  was  identical  words  in  french  and  in  english  
So  if  you  Don't  know, one  of  these  languages  It's  instant  learning  
It's  all  if  
And  we  can  use  them  also  as  a  safety  net  
People  tell  me  their  lives, their  memories, their  aspirations, and  i  create  a  Mindscape  
I  was  also  interested  in  the  Physicality  of  this  format  because  you  have  to  walk  to  see  it  
So  It's, like  the  different  layers  of  what  we  are  made  of, and  what  we  present  to  the  world  as  an  identity  
Why  do  i  call  it  a  book?
After  eight  years  of  Rejection, i  was  thrilled  to  get  my  first  commission  with  the  percent  for  art  in  new  york  city.
Here, It's, Faceted  glass  in  the  bronx  
Because  if  you  sit  a  long  time  in  summer  in  shorts, you  will  walk  away  with  temporary  branding  of  the  story  element  on  your  thighs.
It's  a  story  about  transformation  and  connections  
And  here  I've  been  working  for  the  last  three  years  with  a  south  bronx  developer  to  bring  art  to  life  to  low-income  buildings  and  affordable  housing  
And  i  wanted  to  give  them  an  escape  
But  the  result  is  always  to  have  stories.
And  you  get  to  think  about  yourself  and  your  memories, and  before  you  go  back  into  suspension, you  edit  your  memories  and  you  change  your  personality  and  so  forth.
But  lots  of  people  now  live  to  90  or  100  unless  they  shake  hands  too  much  or  something  like  that  
Which  by  chimpanzee  standards  is  very  good  indeed, 
And  i  guess  i  better  skip  all  the  rest  of  this, which  are  some  details  on  how  we  might  make  those  smart  machines.
Any  guesses, 1816, 
What  has  changed? Our  society  has  been  wireless  devices.
This  is  the  first  one.
In  the  future  You're  going  to  be  checking  all  your  vital  signs, all  your  vital  signs, your  heart, rhythm, your  blood  pressure, your  oxygen, your  temperature, etc.
If  You're  an  Expectant  parent, what  about  the  ability  to  monitor  continuously  fetal  heart  rate  or  Intrauterine  contractions  and  not  having  to  worry  so  much  that  things  are  fine  as  the  pregnancy  and  moving  over  into  the  time  of  delivery  ,
And  then, as  we  go  further  today, we  have  continuous  glucose  sensors, 
I  Didn't  have  one  of  those, but  i  got  the  Fitbit  
Of  course, how  many  here  have  any  problems  with  sleeping  
And  the  wake  time  is  in  orange  
Ok, so  That's, the  first  night, 
Now, diabetes  is  one  of  the  big  ones.
Chronic  Obstructive  pulmonary  disease, 
One  of  the  ones  i  just  wanted  to  mention  the  Ishoe  is  another  example  of  a  sensor  that  improves  Proprioception  among  the  elderly  to  prevent  falling  
One  of  them  --  We're  very  fortunate  --  is  to  develop  a  dedicated  institute  and  That's  work  that  started  with  the  work  that  scripps  with  Qualcomm  
The  wireless  institute, the  west  wireless  health  institute  is  really  the  outgrowth  of  two  extraordinary  people  who  are  here  this  evening, gary  and  mary  west  and  I'd, like  to  give  it  up  for  them  for  getting  behind  this  
There's  also  a  tremendous  number  of  techniques  that  chefs  have  developed  some  about  new  aesthetics, new  approaches  to  food  
None  of  the  techniques  that  these  people  have  developed  over  the  course  of  the  last  20  years  is  in  any  of  those  books  
Is  there  a  way  we  can  show  people  food  in  a  way  they  have  not  seen  it  before  
Then  each  of  the  different  little  pieces  around  it  explain  some  fact, 
Well  that  first  cutaway  picture  worked, so  we  said, okay, Let's  do  some  more  
Once  you  start  cutting  things  in  half, you  kind  of  get  carried  away.
And  each  of  these  text  blocks  explains  a  key  thing: That's  going  on  
But  to  make  them  Palatable, we  cut  it  out  of  a  steel  plate  and  put  it  in  front  of  a  fire  and  photographed  it  like  this  
Everybody  knows  that  your  various  appliances  have  Wattage  right  
As  it  comes  out  of  the  Grinder, you  just  have  a  little  tray  and  you  just  take  it  off  in  little  passes  build  it  up, slice.
Now  watch  closely. This  is  popcorn  I'll, explain  it  here.
The  popcorn  is  illustrating  a  key  thing  in  physics.
But  surgeons  in  these  eras  are  a  little  bit  more  conservative  than  their  bold.
And  he  is  credited  with  doing  over  4000  of  these  public  surgeries  wandering  around  in  europe, which  is  an  astonishing  number.
Joseph  Lister  was  Aepsis's  or  Sterility's  biggest  advocate  to  a  very, very  skeptical  bunch  of  surgeons  
The  mayo  brothers  came  out  to  visit  Lister  in  europe, 
Something  so  simple  
Laparoscopy  is  doing  this  kind  of  surgery  surgery  with  long  instruments  through  small  incisions, 
But  there  were  casualties  of  this  revolution, 
They  had  to  give  up  their  Wrists  
They  had  to  give  up  intuitive  motion  in  the  instruments.
Now, what  you  put  between  those  instruments  and  those  hands  is  a  large, fairly  complicated  robot.
And  since  this  was  introduced  in  1999, a  lot  of  these  robots  have  been  out  and  being  used  for  surgical  procedures  like  a  Prostatectomy, which  is  a  prostate  deep  in  the  pelvis, and  it  requires  fine  dissection  and  delicate  manipulation  to  be  able  to  get  a  good  surgical  outcome.
More  useful  than  a  solid  gold  surgeon, but  still  It's  a  fairly  big  capital, investment  ,
It  has  to  be  able  to  come  off  of  the  centerline, and  then  be  able  to  work  back  toward  that  centerline.
It's, not  so  simple  
For  the  patient, however, It's  transparent.
It's  very  exciting  to  think  where  we  get  to  go  with  this  
As  we  take  these  capabilities  and  we  get  to  go  to  the  next  places, we  get  to  decide  what  our  new  surgeries  are  going  to  be  
And  i  think  to  really  get  the  rest  of  the  way  in  that  revolution, we  need  to  not  just  take  our  hands  in  in  new  ways. We  also  need  to  take  our  eyes  in  in  new  ways.
We  need  to  see  beyond  the  surface.
You  know, for  me, the  interest  in  contemporary  forms  of  slavery  started  with  a  Leaflet  that  i  picked  up  in  london, 
And  I'm  going  to  admit  to  hubris  
It  was  mind-blowing  
But, in  fact, that  kind  of  Bluey  color  are  the  countries  where  we  Can't  find  any  cases  of  slavery  
Well, it  builds  up  with  these  factors.
Add  in  the  increased  vulnerability  of  very  large  numbers  of  people  in  the  developing  world  caused  by  civil  wars, ethnic  conflicts, Kleptocratic, governments  disease, you  name  it.
But  if  corruption  Creeps  in  and  people  Don't  have  the  opportunity  to  have  that  protection  of  the  rule  of  law, then  if  you  can  use  violence, if  you  can  use  violence  with  impunity, you  can  reach  out  and  harvest  the  vulnerable  into  slavery.
All  around  the  world, I've  been  told  an  almost  identical  story  
They  said  that  guy  looked  Sketchy, i  was  suspicious, but  my  children  were  hungry.
We  needed  medicine  
Ten  miles  100  miles  1000  miles  later, they  find  themselves  in  dirty  dangerous  Demeaning  work  
Africans  and  indians  as  usual  south  americans  and  eastern  europeans, in  particular  are  on  our  buy  list.
D, interesting, Micheal  bottom  line.
Kevin  Bales, okay, you  figured  it  out  That's  a  Spoof  
Slaves  cost  between  3000  to  8000  dollars  in  north  america. But  i  could  take  you  places  in  india  or  nepal, where  human  beings  can  be  acquired  for  five  or  10  dollars.
They  key  here  is  that  people  have  Ceased  to  be  that  capital  purchase  item  and  become  like  styrofoam  cups  
You  buy  them  cheaply, you  use  them. You  Crumple  them  up. And  then  when  You're  done  with  them, you  just  throw  them  away.
I've  got  to  say, one  of  the  most  exciting  parts  about  my  job  is  that  i  get  to.
This  is  not  james.
And  it  can  be  done  
Liberation  and  more  importantly, all  the  work  that  comes  after  liberation  
This  is  what  liberation  really  looks  like  
She  said, no, because  We've  got  hope  now  
Okay, thank  you  so  much.
Despite  the  new  york  Times'  and  vanity  Fair's  best  efforts  recently, They're, not  brothers  
This  is  actually  a  training  film  for  a  clown  college  that  they  had  
There  is  a  picture  of  charles  so  Let's.
But  people  live  on  this  land.
So  what  We're  going  to  see  is  some  of  the  icons  of  eames  furniture  
And  I'm, really  here  to  talk  about  design  
And  this  is  a  little  film  i  made  about  the  making  of  the  eames  lounge  chair.
Because  it  just  kind  of, you  know, Doesn't  get  any  more  basic  than  that.
This  is  a  relatively  famous  chair.
But  doing  these  Splints, they  learned  a  lot  about  the  manufacturing  process, which  was  incredibly  important  to  them  
I'm  trying  to  show  you  too  much, because  i  want  you  to  really  get  a  Broth  of  ideas  and  images  
This  is  a  house  that  charles  and  ray  designed  
My  sister  is  chasing  someone  else.
Although  i  endorse  Heartily, the  fact  that  he  stole  her  diary  It's, not  me  
The  house  is  1949  
And  now  I'm  going  to  test  you  
I  hope  you  had  a  nice  time  at  Buddy's  party  
And  they  honor  events  in  the  linear  world  from  the  fictional  world.
And  then  embassy  row  is  actually  a  historical  site, because  in  the  Kymaerican  story, this  is  where  the  Parisian  diaspora  started  where  there  embassy  was  
And  the  town  has  really  embraced  it.
And  You're  kind  of  trapped  in  the  texture  of  kymaerica  
And  this  is  cranbrook  I've  got  a  real  treat  for  you, which  is  the  first  film  that  charles  ever  made  
And  he  made  it  for  the  1939  faculty  exhibition  
You  want  to  learn  how  to  make  films  go  make  a  movie  
So  my  point  is  that  this  scope  of  vision, this  holistic  vision  of  design  was  with  them  from  the  beginning.
It  Wasn't  like, oh, we  made  some  chairs  and  got  successful  
So  We're  going  to  do  the  last  clip  
And  part  of  why  this  stuff  is  important, and  all  the  things  that  we  do  are  important  is  that  these  are  the  ideas  we  need  
And  working  on  the  idea  that  the  cheapest  electric  toaster  would  also  be  the  simplest  to  reverse-engineer, i  went  and  bought  the  cheapest  toaster. I   could  find  took  it  home  and  was  kind  of  dismayed  to  discover  that  inside  this  object, which  I'd  bought  for  just  349  pounds. There  were  400  different  bits  made  out  of  a  Hundred-plus  different  materials.
Can  i  come  up  and  get  some  iron  
But  after  some  nagging, i  got  him  to  do  that  
But  instead  of  a  bellows, i  had  a  leaf  blower.
Plastic  is  the  defining  feature  of  cheap, electrical  goods, 
And  you  can  actually  make  plastic  from  obviously  oils  which  come  from  plants, but  also  from  Starches  
So  this  is  attempting  to  make  potato  starch  plastic  
And  it  was  looking  good  for  a  while, but  i  left  it  outside  because  you  had  to  leave  it  outside  to  dry. And  unfortunately, i  came  back, and  there  were  snails  eating  the  Unhydrolyzed  bits  of  potato.
So  kind  of  out  of  desperation, i  decided  that  i  could  think  Laterally  
And  there  it  is  on  the  shelves  
I  Don't  know  if  you  could  see, but  i  was  never  able  to  make  insulation  for  the  wires.
They  were  trying  to  catch  fish  
However, the  report  focused  on  what  had  already  occurred  and  offered  no  information  on  what  to  expect  now  
Voice  1: It's  coming  again.
You  know, if  you  think  about  something  like  google, which  essentially  is  relying  on  the  collective  intelligence  of  the  web  to  seek  out  those  sites  that  have  the  most  valuable  information  --  we  know  that  google  does  an  Exceptionally  good  job  of  doing  that. And  it  does  that  because  collectively, this  Disorganized  thing  we  call  the  world  wide  web  actually  has  a  remarkable  order  or  a  remarkable  intelligence  in  it.
But  what  the  blogosphere  offers  is  the  possibility  of  getting  at  the  kind  of  collective  Distributive  intelligence  that  is  out  there, and  that  we  know  is  available  to  us  if  we  can  just  figure  out  a  way  of  accessing  it.
A  network  is  not  just  the  product  of  its  component.
It  is  something  more  than  that  
And  that  phenomenon  of  piling  on  the  existing  links  is  one  that  is  characteristic  of  the  blogosphere, particularly  of  the  political  blogosphere. And  it  is  one  that  essentially  throws  off  this  beautiful  decentralized, bottom-up  intelligence  that  blogs  can  manifest  in  the  right  conditions.
When  we  talk  about  bottom-up  decentralized  phenomena, the  ant  colony  is  the  classic  metaphor  because  no  individual  ant  knows  what  It's  doing. But  collectively  ants  are  able  to  reach  incredibly  intelligent  decisions.
But  the  pace  of  exponential  growth  is  really  what  describes  information  technologies  
It  makes  a  huge  difference.
And  Moore's  law  was  not  the  first  paradigm  to  bring  exponential  growth  to  computing  
When  that  comes  to  an  end, We'll  go  to  the  sixth  paradigm, three-dimensional, self-organizing  molecular  circuits.
The  great  depression  made  not  a  dent  in  this  exponential  progression.
And  i  was  asked, well, Aren't, you  nervous  
And  the  cost  of  a  transistor  cycle, which  is  a  measure  of  the  price  performance  of  electronics  comes  down  about  every  year  
But  that  was  really  right  on  schedule.
Communication  technologies, 50  different  ways  to  measure  this. The  number  of  bits  being  moved  around  the  size  of  the  internet.
Some  critics  say, oh  well, software  is  stuck  in  the  mud.
When  i  was  a  student, it  was  across  campus  now  It's  in  our  pockets.
All  the  intellectual  property  that  is  created  and  taught  will  be  online  and  available  and  developed  online  in  a  collaborative  fashion  
Here  is  our  founding  meeting  
So  We're, very  Appreciative  of  the  support  We've, gotten  from  both  the  intellectual  leaders, the  high-tech  leaders, particularly  google  and  nasa  
Whole  arm  shoulder, Disarticulation  
Not  in  an  envelope  of  a  human  arm  with  21  degrees  of  freedom  from  your  shoulder  to  your  fingertips, 
You  think, It's  bad  to  lose  one  arm, 
We  have  14  out  of  the  21  degrees  of  freedom. You  Don't  need  the  ones  in  the  last  two  fingers.
A  couple  of  weeks  ago, we  took  it  down  to  walter  reed, which  is  unfortunately  more  in  the  news.
It's  going  to  go  inside  something  that  we  use  in  cat  scans, and  mris  of  whatever  is  their  good  arm  to  make  silicon  rubber, then  coat  it  and  paint  it  in  3d  --  exact  mirror  image  of  their  other  limb.
This  weighs  69  pounds, 
Now, He's  going  to  pick  up  a  pen  with  his  opposed  thumb  and  index, finger, 
That's  about  10  percent  of  our  global  needs  and  100  percent  of  some  island  nations  
It  all  began  when  two  scientists, fred  Grassle  and  jesse  Ausubel  met  in  woods  hole, massachusetts, where  both  were  guests  at  the  Famed, oceanographic  institute  
They, in  fact, are  an  endangered  species  themselves.
So  fishermen  could  only  catch  what  they  could  either  eat, or  sell  that  day.
But  this  is  no  laughing  matter.
That's  the  sort  of  technology  That's  available  today  that  really  Wasn't  available  even  a  decade  ago.
And  so  for  animals  that  come  to  the  surface  to  breathe, such  as  this  elephant  seal  It's, an  opportunity  to  send  data  back  to  shore  and  tell  us  where  exactly  it  is  in  the  ocean  
For  example, the  dark  blue  shows  you  where  the  elephant  seal  moved  in  the  north  pacific  
For  animals  that  Don't  surface, we  have  something  called  pop-up  tags, which  collect  data  about  light.
Geneticists  have  developed  a  similar  tool  called  genetic  Barcoding  
And  so  they  put  this  together  a  list  of  all  the  species  where  They're  known  to  occur.
So  all  of  a  sudden, this  labor  of  love  for  no  obvious, economic  reason, has  become  a  critical  piece  of  information  in  terms  of  how  that  system  is  going  to  recover  how  long  it  will  take  and  how  the  lawsuits  and  the  Multi-billion-dollar  discussions  that  are  going  to  happen  in  the  coming  years, are  likely  to  be  resolved  
You  can  do  this  on  a  global  scale, but  you  can  also  do  it  on  a  regional  scale.
Now, while  a  lot  of  the  species  we  discovered  in  the  census  are  things  that  are  small  and  hard  to  see  that  certainly  Wasn't  always  the  case  
Similarly, this  golden  v  kelp  collected  in  alaska, just  below  the  low  water. Mark  is  probably  a  new  species.
This  particular  shrimp, We've, Dubbed  it, the  jurassic  shrimp  It's  thought  to  have  gone  extinct  50  years  ago  --  at  least  it  was  until  the  census  discovered. It  was  living  and  doing  just  fine  off  the  coast  of  australia.
Now, this  little  critter  It's  only  about  half  a  millimeter  in  size, not  terribly  charismatic  
And  we  also  found  this  spectacular  Yeti  crab  that  lives  near  boiling  hot  hydrothermal  vents  at  easter  island  
That  means  91  percent, even  after  the  census  still  remain  to  be  discovered  
But  the  really  intriguing  thing  about  the  microbes  is  just  how  diverse  they  are  
A  single  drop  of  seawater  could  contain  160  different  types  of  microbes.
The  other  point  I'd  like  to  make  about  this  is  that  this  Ocean's  interconnected  
Census  scientists  worked  in  the  rain. They  worked  in  the  cold, they  worked  under  water, and  they  worked  above  water  trying  to  illuminate  the  wondrous  discovery, the  still  vast  unknown  the  spectacular  adaptations  that  we  see  in  ocean  life.
So  whether  You're  a  Yak  herder  living  in  the  mountains  of  chile, whether  You're  a  Stockbroker  in  new  york  city  or  whether  You're  a  tedster  living  in  edinburgh, the  oceans  matter  
♫  i  could  show  the  world  how  to  smile  ♫  ♫  i  could  be  glad  all  of  the  while  ♫  ♫  i  could  turn  the  gray  skies  to  blue  if  i  had  you  ♫  ♫  i  could  leave  the  old  days  behind  ♫  ♫  leave  all  my  pals  I’d  never  mind  ♫  ♫  i  could  start  my  life  all  anew  if  i  had  you  ♫  ♫  i  could  climb  the  Snow-capped  mountains  ♫  ♫  sail  the  mighty  ocean  wide  ♫  ♫  i  could  cross  the  burning  desert. If  i  had  you  by  my  side  ♫  ♫  i  could  be  a  king, dear  Uncrowned, humble  or  poor, rich  or  renowned  ♫  ♫  there  is  nothing, i  Couldn’t  do  if  i  had  you  ♫  thank  you. Well. Thank  you  so  much.
And  There's  a  cause  for  that  all  right  
Well, It's  been  around  for  2500  years.
And  we  do  something  different  than  what  we  did  in  the  past.
If  there  are  15  operations, you  know  that  none  of  them  work  
You've  heard  that  word  several  times  in  the  last  four  days  and  Everyone's  familiar  with  Kuhnian  paradigms, 
And  by  the  human  spirit, i  Don't  mean  anything  divine.
What  i  mean  is  this  ability  that  each  of  us  has  to  be  something  greater  than  herself  or  himself  to  arise  out  of  our  ordinary  selves  and  achieve  something  that  at  the  beginning, we  thought  perhaps  we  were  not  capable  of  
There  has  certainly  been  no  argument  about  that  in  this  room, in  the  past  four  days, 
So  if  we  are  to  be  the  World's  healer, every  Disadvantaged  person  in  this  world  --  including  in  the  united  states  --  becomes  our  patient  
I  would  like  to  quote, one  of  my  own  household, gods  
Think  about  it  
Rudimentary  animal  has  a  nervous  system  swims  around  in  the  ocean  in  its  juvenile  life.
If  you  put  a  five  year-old  Child's  dexterity  against  the  best  robots  of  today, the  answer  is  simple: the  child  wins  easily  
When  it  comes  to  being  Dexterous  It's, not  even  clear, what  the  algorithm  is  you  have  to  solve  to  be  Dexterous  
But  let  me  show  you  cutting-edge  robotics  
Now, the  americans  in  the  audience  will  know  all  about  cup  stacking  
And  it  sounds  like  an  easy  problem.
So  the  old  days  before  digital  radio, when  you  were  tuning  in  your  radio  and  you  heard  Crrcckkk  on  the  station  you  wanted  to  hear  that  was  the  noise  
So  if  You're  lucky  enough  to  be  able  to  knock  a  small  white  ball  into  a  hole, several  hundred  yards  away  using  a  long  metal  stick, our  society  will  be  willing  to  reward  you  with  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars.
But  We're  going  to  represent  beliefs  with  probabilities  
But  There's  another  source  of  information  and  That's  effectively  prior  knowledge, 
But  you  know  that  your  senses  are  not  perfect  and  therefore  There's  some  variability  of  where  It's  going  to  land  shown  by  that  cloud  of  red, representing  numbers  between  05  and  maybe  01  
That  information  is  available  in  the  current  shot, but  There's  another  source  of  information, not  available  on  the  current  shot, but  only  available  by  repeated  experience  in  the  game  of  tennis  and  That's  that  the  ball  Doesn't  bounce  with  equal  probability  over  the  court  during  the  match  
As  we  go  around, we  learn  about  statistics  of  the  world  and  lay  that  down, but  we  also  learn  about  how  noisy  our  own  sensory  apparatus  is, and  then  combine  those  in  a  real  bayesian  way.
So  that  really  means, i  have  to  make  predictions  of  the  future  
Any  discrepancy  should  hopefully  be  external  
So  as  i  go  around  the  world, I'm  making  predictions  of  what  i  should  get  subtracting  them  off  
And  we  replay  that  to  the  other  hand  with  a  time  delay, 
And  based  on  this  illustration, we  really  convinced  ourselves  in  the  field  that  the  Brain's  making  precise  predictions  and  subtracting  them  off  from  the  sensations.
So  we  were  looking  for  a  much  more  objective  way  to  assess  this  phenomena.
So  if  they  Retaliate  with  the  same  force, the  first  person  will  think  It's  been  escalated  
Now, we  Don't  work  with  children, we  Don't  work  with  hitting, but  the  concept  is  identical  
We  started  with  a  motor  with  a  little  lever, a  little  force, Transfuser  
So  it  Re-shows, the  brain  makes  predictions  and  fundamentally  changes  the  Precepts  
But  We've  got  a  problem  
And  There's  a  big  gap  between  the  task  and  the  movement  system  
I  could  choose  these  two  paths  out  of  an  infinite  number  of  paths.
Maybe  we  Don't  all  quite  move  the  same  way.
But  There's  noise  added  to  this  
So  if  i  pick  the  same  command  through  many  times, i  will  get  a  different  noisy  version  each  time  because  noise  changes  each  time.
And  the  fundamental  idea  is, you  want  to  plan  your  movements.
So  you  want  to  avoid  big  forces  as  one  principle, 
So  We've  shown  that  using  this, we  can  explain  a  huge  amount  of  data  --  that  exactly  people  are  going  about  their  lives  planning  movements.
All  the  conversation  stopped  all  the  eyes  turned  to  me  
And  so  what  I'd  like  to  do  now  is  to  tell  you  about  what  We've  learned  in  those  journeys  
They  put  smart  skylights  through  their  stores, so  they  could  harvest  the  daylight  and  reduce  the  lighting  demands  
So  let  me  tell  you  this  when  wal-mart  Achieves  20  percent  energy  reductions, That's  going  to  be  a  very  big  deal, but  I'm  afraid  It's  not  enough  
Well, bob  said, the  most  important  thing  we  could  do  right  now  is  to  make  it  clear  in  sacramento  california, that  we  need  a  market-based  system  of  mandates, That's  going  to  cap  and  reduce  greenhouse  gases  in  california.
Here's  a  story  about  national  policy  that  we  could  all  learn  from  
They'd  run  ethanol  or  ordinary  gasoline  
So  What's  happened  in  brazil  is  They've  replaced  40  percent  of  the  gasoline  consumed  by  their  automotive  fleet  with  ethanol  
So  a  team  of  berkeley, researchers  with  15  million  dollars  from  the  gates  foundation, is  engineering  designing  a  radical  new  way  to  make  the  key  ingredient  called  Artemisinin  and  They're  going  to  make  that  drug  10  times  cheaper, 
Well, I'll  tell  you  --  a  lot  
Second  fact, the  President's  new  budget  for  renewable  energy  is  barely  a  billion  dollars  in  total  
Third  fact, i  bet  you  Didn't  know  that  There's  enough  energy  in  hot  rocks  under  the  country  to  supply  America's  energy  needs  for  the  next  thousand  years  and  the  federal  budget  calls  for  a  Measly  20  million  dollars  of  R&ampd  in  geothermal  energy.
Not  enough  to  stabilize  the  climate  
Not  enough  to  keep  the  ice  in  greenland  from  crashing  into  the  ocean  
We've  got  to  make  this  economic, so  that  all  people  and  all  nations  make  the  right  outcome, the  profitable  outcome, and  therefore  the  likely  outcome  
It  is  the  mother  of  all  markets.
She's  like, oh  us  I'm  like, okay.
And  There's  a  dude  selling  these  Aftermarket  weapons  for  lego  because  lego  --  the  danish  --  no  They're  not  into  guns.
But  the  americans, oh, We'll, make  some  guns  for  lego.
And  at  a  certain  point, you  look  around  You're  like, whoa.
I'm  kind  of  into  this  stuff  and  I'm  going  to  stop  being  embarrassed.
And  so  this  is  like  this  cad  program  where  you  build  it  
I  have  to  take  a  moment  
There's  a  whole  gray  market  for  lego, thousands  of  Home-based  businesses, 
Let's  see  here  
That's, 300  million  years  per  minute  
So  this  is  frozen  water.
The  most  intriguing  and  puzzling  measurement  in  my  opinion, We've  obtained  of  mars  was  released  earlier  this  year  in  the  magazine, science  
And  what  We're  looking  at  is  the  presence  of  the  gas  methane, Ch4  in  the  atmosphere  of  mars  
That's  because  the  northern  hemisphere  is  the  region  of  the  ancient  ocean  basin  
And  That's  because  the  water  protected  the  basin  from  being  impacted  by  asteroids  and  Meteorites  
Here's  Hellas  basin  a  very, very  different  place.
We  addressed  on  the  board, the  major  questions  that  have  not  been  answered.
And  the  result  of  our  meeting  was  a  robotic  Rocket-powered  airplane.
And  our  goal  is  to  inspire  the  american  public  who  is  paying  for  this  mission  through  tax  dollars.
How  do  we  transport  an  airplane  to  mars  
And  we  have  it  in  something  called  an  Aeroshell  
Because  we  have  tested  ares  model  several  models  in  a  half  a  dozen  wind  tunnels  at  the  nasa  langley  research  center  for  eight  years  under  mars  conditions.
We're  ready  to  go  
This  is  the  ares  team  we  have  about  150  scientists  engineers  where  We're  working  with  jet  propulsion, laboratory  Goddard  space  flight  center  ames  research  center  and  half  a  dozen, major  universities  and  corporations  in  developing  this  
Thank  you  very  much  
And  my  colleague, james  fowler, and  i  have  been  studying  for  quite  sometime, what  are  the  mathematical  social  biological  and  psychological  rules  that  govern  how  these  networks  are  assembled.
They  actually  diffuse  through  networks, 
You  could  have  friendship  relationships: sibling  relationships, Spousal  relationships, Co-worker  relationships, neighbor  relationships.
Or  their  altruistic  or  their  charitable, giving  behavior  might  be  influenced  by  their  coworkers  or  by  their  neighbors.
Nicholas  Christakis  b, It's  obvious, ,
And  what  we  show  here  is  --  like  here  --  very  few  people  are  affected  more  and  more  and  more  and  up  to  here  and  Here's, the  peak  of  the  epidemic  
And  if  they  nominate  the  party  host  as  their  friend  that  party  host  has  a  hundred  friends, therefore  has  more  friends  than  they  do.
So  we  thought  we  would  exploit  this  idea  in  order  to  study  whether  we  could  predict  phenomena  within  networks.
And  also, we  had  them  [actively]  email  us  a  couple  of  times  a  week.
By  monitoring, the  friends  group  we  could  get  16  days  advance  warning  of  an  impending  epidemic  in  this  human  population  
Now, in  our  case, although  it  Wasn't  necessary, we  could  also  actually  map  the  network  of  the  students.
We're  going  to  take  daily  cuts  through  the  network  for  120  days.
Every  dot  is  a  person, and  every  line  represents  a  volume  of  calls  between  the  people  
And  in  fact, we  are  in  the  era  of  what  i  would  call  Massive-passive  data  collection  efforts, 
They're  all  kinds  of  ways  we  can  use  massively  collected  data  to  create  sensor  networks  to  follow  the  population  understand  What's  happening  in  the  population  and  intervene  in  the  population  for  the  better  
One  is  Quasi-active, like  the  flu  example, i  gave  where  we  get  some  people  to  nominate  their  friends  and  then  passively  monitor  their  friends  --  do  they  have  the  flu  or  not  --  and  then  get  warning  
They  collect  millions  of  points  at  a  time  with  very  high  accuracy  and  very  high  resolution  
They  were  gone  in  an  instant  
The  royal  Tombs  had  been  destroyed  by  suspected  Arson  
Let  me  leave  you  with  a  final  thought, 
And  that  was  that  an  american  congresswoman  named  patricia  Schroeder  from  colorado, met  with  a  group  of  journalists  
It  will  refer  you  directly  to  your  Congressperson  to  your  us  senator  to  your  governor  where  Divestment  legislation  is  pending.
For  instance, the  Referral  of  the  crimes  in  darfur  to  the  international  criminal  court, which  the  bush  administration  Doesn't  like  ,
He  moved  with  the  headlines  
But  uh-oh, the  killers  are  within  the  camps.
Well, if  you  denounce  You're  probably  never  going  to  get  back  in  the  room  
You're  Un-owned  
He  started  as  somebody  who  would  denounce  Harmdoers. He  would  charge  up  to  people  who  were  violating  international  law, and  he  would  say, You're  violating.
All  the  great  progress  in  this  country, with  relation  to  our  adversaries  has  come  by  going  into  the  room  
There's  going  to  be  a  lot  of  people  
But  it  never  struck  me  as  it  did  that  moment.
A  hundred  years  ago, we  Didn't  
At  our  time  in  history, these  images  are  out  of  place.
This  is  more  than  hiv/aids.
And  here  you  see  a  brain  scan  of  two  children  --  one  who  had  adequate  nutrition, another  neglected, and  who  was  deeply  malnourished, 
And  so  today  we  focus  on  not  just  passing  out  food, but  making  sure  the  mothers  have  enough  Enrichment  and  teaching  them  about  breastfeeding  
It  Doesn't  need  to  be  refrigerated.
Eighty  percent  of  the  people  in  the  world  have  no  food  safety  net  
And  usually  the  institutions  --  churches, temples, other  things  --  do  not  have  the  resources  to  provide  a  safety  net  
And  if  you  fill  the  cup  with  local  agriculture  from  small  farmers, you  have  a  transformative  effect.
Many  kids  in  the  world, Can't  go  to  school  because  they  have  to  go  beg  and  find  a  meal  
It  costs  less  than  25  cents  a  day  to  change  a  Kid's  life.
Families  need  the  help  
So  is  this  a  hopeless  cause  
Cameroon, northern  cameroon, boom  and  bust  cycles  of  hunger.
Food  aid  coming  in  every  year  when  people  are  starving  during  the  lean  seasons  
You  manage  the  village  manages, these  warehouses  
And  the  food  banks  are  growing  
We're  seeing  that  now, in  the  horn  of  africa  where  food  prices  are  up  240  percent  in  some  areas  over  last  year  
The  Shopkeepers  are  hiring, more  people, 
And  they  require  that  a  third  of  that  food  come  from  the  smallest  farmers  who  would  have  no  opportunity  
I've  gone  out  there  I've  met  with  the  small  farmers  who  have  built  their  livelihoods  on  the  opportunity  and  platform  provided  by  this  
You  look  at  the  cost-benefit  analysis, and  my  dream  is  to  take  this  issue, not  just  from  the  compassion  argument, but  to  the  finance  ministers  of  the  world  and  say, we  Cannot  afford  to  not  invest  in  the  access  to  adequate  affordable  nutrition  for  all  of  humanity.
When  a  leader  says, not  under  my  watch  everything  begins  to  change  
Wfp's  been  able  to  leave  30  nations  because  they  have  transformed  the  face  of  hunger  in  their  nations.
Not  only  that  transforming  hunger  is  an  opportunity.
What's  exciting  is  that  over  the  last  two  or  three  years, the  government  has  spent  400  million  dollars  and  They've  allocated  another  billion  dollars  to  what  we  call  the  cancer  genome  atlas  project  
The  cancer  genome  atlas  is  coming  out  now, 
There's  also  a  field  of  proteomics  that  I'll  talk  about  in  a  few  minutes, which  i  think  is  going  to  be  the  next  level  in  terms  of  understanding  and  Classifying  disease.
Cancer  is  an  interaction  of  a  cell  that  no  longer  is  under  growth  control  with  the  environment.
The  goal  of  me  as  a  cancer  doctor  is  not  to  understand  cancer  
You  know, if  i  measured  your  temperature  over  30  days, and  i  asked  what  was  the  average  temperature  
I  mean, this  is  a  scary  slide, not  to  take  an  aside, but  it  looks  at  obesity  in  the  world.
So  our  systems  today  are  dramatically  different  than  our  systems, a  decade  or  two  ago.
That  is  the  most  effective  cost-effective  best  way  we  can  do  things  today.
Sounds  are  affecting  your  hormone  Secretions  all  the  time, but  also  your  breathing  your  heart  rate  --  which  i  just  also  did  --  and  your  brainwaves  
It  has  the  frequency  of  roughly  12  cycles  per  minute  
There  are  eight  expressions  of  a  brand  in  sound  
You  all  recognize  that  one. This  is  the  Most-played  tune  in  the  world  today.
Why  are  we  doing  this  
The  first  is  It's  essential  for  us  to  understand  the  human  brain. If  we  do  want  to  get  along  in  society. And  i  think  that  it  is  a  key  step  in  evolution.
And  you  may  think  that  Anesthetics  work  by  sending  you  into  some  deep  sleep  or  by  blocking  your  receptors, so  that  you  Don't  feel  pain.
99  percent  of  what  you  see  is  not  what  comes  in  through  the  eyes.
They  are  highly  reactive, and  they  are  Super-plastic. And  so  the  Autists  are  probably  capable  of  building  and  learning  a  symphony, which  is  unthinkable  for  us.
They  choose  very  carefully  who  they  connect  with  
And  we  did  that  for  tens  of  thousands  of  neurons, built  digital  models  of  all  the  different  types  of  neurons.
And  we  think  this  is  species-specific, which  means  that  that  could  explain  why  we  Can't  communicate  across  species.
So  Let's  switch  it  on, but  to  do  it, what  you  have  to  do  is  you  have  to  make  this  come  alive.
There  literally  are  only  a  handful  of  equations  that  you  need  to  simulate  the  activity  of  the  neocortex.
Here  we  activate  it. And  this  gives  the  first  glimpse  of  what  is  happening  in  your  brain.
We  can  ask, where  is  it  inside  if  we  stimulate  it  with  a  picture  
Fifty  years  ago, when  i  began  exploring  the  ocean, no  one  --  not  jacques  Perrin, not  jacques  cousteau  or  rachel  carson  --  imagined  that  we  could  do  anything  to  harm  the  ocean  by  what  we  put  into  it, or  by  what  we  took  out  of  it.
I  want  to  share  with  you  my  personal  view  of  changes  in  the  sea  that  affect  all  of  us  and  to  consider  why  it  matters  that  in  50  years, We've  lost  --  actually  We've  taken  We've  eaten  --  more  than  90  percent  of  the  big  fish  in  the  sea. Why  you  should  care  that  nearly  half  of  the  coral  reefs  have  disappeared. Why  a  mysterious  depletion  of  oxygen  in  large  areas  of  the  pacific  should  concern  not  only  the  creatures  that  are  dying. But  it  really  should  concern.
I'm  haunted  by  the  thought  of  what  ray  anderson  calls  Tomorrow's  child  asking, why  we  Didn't  do  something  on  our  watch  to  save  sharks  and  bluefin  tuna  and  Squids  and  coral  reefs  and  the  living  ocean, while  there  still  was  time  
For  me  as  a  scientist, it  all  began  in  1953.
Since  then  I've  used  about  30  kinds  of  submarines  and  I've  started  three  companies  and  a  nonprofit  foundation  called  deep  search  to  design  and  build  systems  to  access  the  deep  sea.
And  I'm  living  proof, 
No  matter  where  on  earth  you  live  
Over  time, most  of  the  Planet's  organic  carbon  has  been  absorbed  and  stored  there, mostly  by  microbes  
You  did  a  great  job  with  the  land, the  dirt  
We  need  new  deep-diving, submarines  
That's  bad  news  for  us  too  
We're, putting  hundreds  of  millions  of  tons  of  plastic  and  other  trash  into  the  sea  
Millions  of  tons  of  discarded, fishing  nets, gear  that  continues  to  kill  
We're  still  killing  bluefin  tuna, truly  endangered  and  much  more  valuable  alive  than  dead  
Using  google  earth  you  can  witness  Trawlers  --  in  china, the  north  sea, the  gulf  of  mexico  --  shaking  the  foundation  of  our  life  support  system, leaving  plumes  of  death  in  their  path.
Together  we  had  just  broken  the  world  speed  record  for  a  trek  to  the  south  pole.
Now, many  of  you  are  probably  saying, wait  a  sec.
You'll  be  in  a  massive  Headwind  
Virtually  none  all  of  our  equipment, including  film  equipment  was  charged  by  the  sun.
Look  at  that  central  building  right  in  the  middle  of  the  picture, That's, the  130-foot  diameter  library  that  is  exactly  the  size  of  the  base  of  the  spaceship.
Two  days  later, the  space  Traveler's  manifesto  explaining  why  --  just  like  we  heard  yesterday  --  why  we  need  to  go  into  space  trips  to  satellites  of  the  outer  planets.
And  That's, why  when  you  get  something  declassified  That's, what  it  looks  like  
This  is  ed  day  putting. So  each  of  these  coffee  cans  has  three  pounds  of  C4  in  it.
So  thanks  to  him, 
And  now  we  have  ground  hazard  assessments  when  you  have  a  blow-up  on  the  pad  
This  is  the  kind  of  stuff, That's  not  been  declassified, just  that  people  managed  to  sneak  home.
And  one  part  of  nasa  was  interested  in  it, but  the  headquarters  in  nasa, they  killed  the  project  
So  finally, at  the  end, we  can  see  the  thing  followed  its  sort  of  design  path  right  up  to  1965.
And  it  turned  out  to  be  quite  fun  in  two  ways.
And  to  the  extent, you  believe  i  Didn't  shrink  the  lines, which  i  Didn't  I've  proven  to  you  that  your  eyes  were  Deceiving.
Right  It's: impossible  to  overcome  this  sense  that  this  is  indeed  longer  
Turns  out  that  they  got  to  28  percent  after  mailing  every  household  in  the  country, a  letter, begging  people  to  join  this  organ  donation  program  
When  you  walk  into  the  dmv, the  person  who  designed  the  form  will  have  a  huge  influence  on  what  You'll  end  up  doing  
What  do  you  do? Do  you  pull  the  patient  back  and  try  ibuprofen?
The  other  group  of  the  physicians, they  said  yesterday, when  you  reviewed  the  case  you  discovered, there  were  two  medications.
Now, think  of  it, this  decision  makes  it  as  easy  to  let  the  patient  continue  with  hip  replacement.
The  thing  is  is  that  no  physician  would  ever  say, Piroxicam  ibuprofen  hip  replacement  
An  online  subscription  for  59  dollars  
These  are  the  market  share  most  people  wanted  the  Combo  deal.
The  answer  was  absolutely  yes.
Now, You're  getting  it  
And  we  also  have  more  than  five  billion  of  these  devices. Here.
These  14  million  cellular  radio  Masts  or  base  stations  consume  a  lot  of  energy  
And  that  creates  a  big  problem  
It's  good  for  a  nice  Suntan, but  otherwise  dangerous  for  the  human  body.
And  multiply  that  by  10000, then  you  end  up  at  14  billion  
Not  usable  for  a  youtube  video: 
And  the  light  goes  through  that  hole  
And  that  signal  is  then  converted  back  to  a  high-speed  data  stream  
And  not  only  integrate  a  photo  detector  here, but  maybe  use  the  camera  inside  
So  what  happens  when  i  switch  on  that  light  
But  at  the  same  time, you  see  this  video  coming  up  here.
So  no  one, if  i  have  a  light  here, if  i  have  secure  data, no  one  on  the  other  side  of  this  room, through  that  wall  would  be  able  to  read  that  data  
So  for  me, the  applications  of  it  to  me  are  beyond  imagination  at  the  moment, 
And  they  use  light  to  illuminate  space  down  there.
If  you  saw  2001, a  space  odyssey  and  you  heard  the  boom, boom, boom, boom. And  you  saw  the  Monolith, you  know, that  was  arthur  c, Clarke's  representation  that  we  were  at  a  seminal  moment  in  the  evolution  of  our  species.
And  you  know, we  in  the  last  30  years, in  particular  have  seen  this  acceleration  in  knowledge  and  technology  and  technology  has  bred  more  knowledge  and  given  us  tools  
And  We've  seen  many  seminal  moments  
You're, walking  around  your  car, has  12  microprocessors  
Then  we  go  along  and  create  the  internet  and  connect  the  world  together, we  flatten  the  world  
The  dna  is  organized  in  words, call  them  genes  and  chromosomes.
Dna  is  a  very  elegant  molecule.
This  here  is  a  bug  in  my  genome  that  i  have  struggled  with  for  a  long  long  time.
What  is  the  code  
Then  you  can  go  about  the  process  of  trying  to  fix  it  and  figure  it  out  
For  my  wife  eat  three  times  as  much  and  you  never  put  on  any  weight.
It's  all  hidden  in  this  code  and  It's, starting  to  be  understood  at  Breakneck  pace, 
We  can  understand, for  example, why  we  create  plaque  in  our  arteries, what  creates  the  Starchiness  inside  of  a  grain?
We  can  also  look  at  at  a  grander  scale.
Now  you  have  the  genome, and  you  say  to  yourself. So  if  i  plug  this  synthetic  genome  --  if  i  pull  the  old  one  out  and  plug  it  in  --  does  it  just  boot  up  and  live  ?
And  this  is  extremely  profound  
So  then  what  do  you  do?
We  can  start  to  figure  that  out  
And  he  had  the  best  answer  i  ever  heard  to  this  question.
You  Cannot  compete  with  the  environment.
Go  on  something  should  happen  now  
No  we  go  puppy, sit  --  boom, It's  got  it  in  six  to  10  trials  
He'll  find  jamie, wherever  he  is, you  know, wherever  kids  are  crushing  rocks  by  a  stream  or  something  and  take  him  a  little  message  that  says, hey, Dinner's, ready, come  in  for  dinner, 
So  at  this  point, the  dog  knows  what  we  want  it  to  do.
The  dog  lives  with  you, the  dog  can  get  you  any  time.
So  the  second  stage  in  training  is  to  teach  the  dog  to  want  to  do  what  we  want  him  to  do. And  this  is  very  easy.
And  what  We're  doing  in  essence  is  We're  teaching  the  dog  kind  of  like  --  We're, letting  the  dog  think  that  the  dog  is  training  us.
And  now  the  Dog's  really  happy  
There's  several  definitions  of  what  a  punishment  is. But  one  definition, the  most  popular  is  a  punishment  is  a  stimulus  that  reduces  the  immediately  preceding  behavior, such  that  It's  less  likely  to  occur  in  the  future.
The  dog  is  actually  euthanized  now. But  this  was  a  dog.
When  the  dog  would  try  to  leave  the  mat, she  would  say, rover  on  the  mat  on  the  mat  on  the  mat  
How  are  you  going  to  Reprimand  a  grizzly  bear?
Rover  come  here  rover, come  here  you  son  of  a  bitch  
And  i  went, oh  my  god, do  i  do  something  
The  husband  Won't  clear  up  his  clothes, or  the  Wife's, always  late  for  meetings, whatever  it  is, ok, .
You  see  it, especially  in  the  workplace, especially  from  boss  to  employee  
And  this  i  would  say, is  the  biggest  human  Foible  that  we  have  
Your  kids  are  easy  to  train.
We  think  how  we  do  it  --  one  night  in  bed  We're  pregnant  and  then  We're  raising  the  most  important  thing  in  life, a  child  
And  it  concludes  in  something  that  you  see  here  that  you  actually  Wouldn't  expect  as  being  the  result  of  rationality  
I  call  it  sort  of  shotgun  flexibility.
So  what  You're  seeing  now  is  actually  the  design  of  the  building  
So  that  was  the  core  idea.
So  once  we  had  presented  that  back  to  them, they  agreed  that  this  sort  of  core  concept  could  work.
The  things  on  the  --  on  the  left-hand  side  of  the  diagram, those  are  the  boxes  
That  skin  serves  double  duty  again  for  economics.
So  It's  an  unusual  building  for  a  public  library, obviously, 
That  was  the  main  sort  of  technology  area  in  the  building  
You  dizzy  yet, 
And  it  allowed  us  to  go  back  to  first  principles  and  redefine  fly  tower, acoustic  enclosure  light  enclosure  and  so  forth.
They  came  to  us, and  they  said  --  unlike  normal  developers  --  they  said, we  want  to  start  out  by  providing  a  contemporary  art  museum  in  louisville. That's.
And  so  instead  of  being  a  developer  that  sees  an  opportunity  to  make  money, they  saw  an  ability  to  be  a  catalyst  in  their  downtown  .
And  that  pro  Forma  led  us  to  a  Mixed-use  building  that  was  very  large  in  order  to  support  their  aspirations  of  the  art.
And  there  is  a  pedestrian  corridor  that  they  wanted  to  add  that  would  link  a  series  of  cultural  buildings  and  a  view  corridor  --  because  this  is  the  historic  district  --  that  they  Didn't  want  to  Obstruct  with  the  new  building  
It  also  means  that  if  an  artist  wants  to  invade  something  like  a  swimming  pool, they  can  begin  to  do  their  exhibition  in  a  swimming  pool. So  They're  not  forced  to  always  work  within  the  confines  of  a  contemporary  gallery  space.
Ok, now, You're  19  now, 
And  i  tried  and  i  made  it  
And  you  made  it  out  of  what  
And  so  and  that  windmill, what  --  it  worked  
Yeah, 
So, what  did  they  make  of  --  that  you  were  14  15  at  the  time  --  what  did  they  make  of  this?
Yeah, 
So  that  would  produce  irrigation  for  the  entire  village  
Because  it  gets  into  all  sorts  of  crazy  realms  :
♫  this  is  a  loop  feedback  loop  ♫  ♫  this  is  a  loop  feedback  loop  ♫  ♫  this  is  a  loop  feedback  loop  ♫  ♫  this  is  a  loop  feedback  loop  ♫  ♫  this  is  a  loop  feedback  loop  ♫  ♫  this  is  a  loop  feedback  loop  ♫  ♫  this  is  a  --  all  right?
There  seems  to  be  a  rule  in  nature  that  if  you  get  too  close  to  where  you  came  from, it  gets  ugly  
The  oil  was  running  out  and  a  nuclear  winter  would  finish  us  off  
It  just  tells  you  they  were  both  designed  to  fit  the  human  hand.
Homo  erectus  made  the  same  tool  for  30000  generations.
Of  course, there  were  a  few  changes, but  tools  changed  slower  than  skeletons  in  those  days.
It's  an  extraordinary  phenomenon, but  It's  true  
And  more  than  that  It's  a  Confection  of  different  ideas, the  idea  of  plastic, the  idea  of  a  laser  the  idea  of  transistors  
One  goes  extinct  for  the  other  to  survive  
So  what  sex  does  is  it  enables  the  individual  to  draw  upon  the  genetic  innovations  of  the  whole  species, 
So  oz  is  better  at  both  spears  and  axes  than  adam  .
Ask  yourself, how  long  you  would  have  to  work  to  provide  for  yourself  an  hour  of  reading  light, this  evening  to  read  a  book  by  
And  That's  seven  and  a  half  seconds  of  prosperity  that  You've  gained  since  1950  as  it  were  because  That's  seven  and  a  half  seconds  in  which  you  can  do  something  else, or  you  can  acquire  another  good  or  service.
They  were  a  highly  intelligent  species.
The  reason  because  tierra  del  Fuego  is  separated  from  south  america  by  a  much  narrower  straight, and  there  was  trading  contact  across  that  straight  throughout  10000  years.
The  Tasmanians  were  isolated, 
It's, not  the  same  with  language.
With  language  we  have  to  transfer  ideas  that  we  understand  with  each  other  
There  will  be  wars. There  will  be  Depressions.
My  work  is  about  the  behaviors  that  we  all  engage  in  unconsciously  on  a  collective  level.
And  as  individuals, we  all  do  these  things  all  the  time  everyday  
It's  like  when  You're  mean  to  your  wife  because  You're  mad  at  somebody  else, 
Or  when  you  Overeat  because  your  feelings  are  hurt  or  whatever  
That's, 15  minutes  of  our  cup  consumption, 
And  if  you  could  actually  stack  up  that  many  cups  in  real  life  That's  the  size, it  would  be  
I  wanted  to  make  a  piece  that  shows  the  actual  number  of  americans  who  die  from  cigarette  smoking.
And  we  Aren't  talking  about  it  --  we  dismiss  it  
And  strangely  enough, the  only  plastic  surgery  that  is  more  popular  than  breast  augmentation  is  liposuction. And  most  of  that  is  being  done  by  men.
My  belief  is  that  you  Don't  have  to  make  yourself  bad  to  look  at  these  issues.
How  can  we  investigate  this  flora  of  viruses  that  surround  us  and  aid  medicine?
But  evolution  is  a  balance  where  you  have  fast  change.
And  so  we  looked  into  this  a  little  more  carefully  and  I'm  going  to  show  you  data.
Down  here  you  can  see  slower  evolution, less  diversity, 
Ok, so  That's  what  we  did, but  how  are  we  going  to  do  that?
If  You've  got  enough  money  to  buy  just  a  Camry, you  can  build  one  of  these  too.
And  so  what  we  did  --  and  this  is  a  really  cool  project  --  we  just  started  by  making  a  respiratory  virus  chip  
That's  the  scourge  of  daycare  centers  everywhere  --  It's  like  Boogeremia, basically, 
And  so  it  is  not  any  one  stripe  or  something  that  tells  me  i  have  a  virus  of  a  particular  type  here. It's  the  barcode  that  in  bulk  represents  the  whole  thing.
That's  me  getting  a  Nasal  Lavage  
Actually  we  thought  the  Nasal  tract  might  be  full  of  viruses, even  when  You're  walking  around  healthy  ,
So  That's, great, but  again, cheap  shot, right  .
So  we  built  out  the  chip  
Now  We're  using  this  chip, and  what  are  we  using  it  for  
And  this  is  what  this  looks  like  
And  that  is, in  fact, what  these  particular  cell  cultures  are  chronically  infected  with  
So  Let's  do  something  a  little  bit  harder.
They  did  a  ct  scan, 
Switch  antibiotics  so  they  switched  to  another  antibiotic  tamiflu: 
There's  almost  no  epidemiology  or  studies  on  it.
And  why  is  that  just  lore  There's, no  data  --  no  data  to  support  whether  it  causes  severe  or  mild  disease?
It  Doesn't  make  sense  --  unless  maybe  There's  a  virus  
And  this  is  a  little  Phylogenetic  tree  to  see  how  It's  related  to  other  viruses.
Is  it  the  case  that  these  guys  are  just  more  susceptible  to  viruses  
This  was  all  done  by  folks  in  the  lab  --  i  Cannot  take  credit  for  most  of  this  
I'm  talking  about  the  production  of  aluminum  
The  electrolyte  is  not  a  solution  of  salt  and  water, but  rather  salt  That's  melted  .
So  now, how  to  choose  the  metals  
I  felt  the  thrill  of  realization  when  i  knew  I'd  come  upon  the  answer  
It's  pretty  cool  at  least  in  theory.
We  go  to  the  laboratory  
No, i  hire  a  student  and  mentor  him.
And  i  was  able  to  attract  really, really  good  people  people  who  share  my  passion  for  science  and  service  to  society, not  science  and  service  for  career, building  
I  went  to  aspen  recently  and  stumbled  into  this  song, 
♫  black  men  go  to  aspen  ♫  ♫  and  rent, colorful  Chalets  ♫  ♫  Giggle  at  the  questions  ♫  ♫  their  mere  presence  seems  to  raise  ♫  ♫  get  taken  for  men  ♫  ♫  we  Don't  resemble  in  the  least  ♫  are  you  
And  since  they  discovered  those  things, it  really  stuck  with  them  so  much  more. And  also  they  would  experience  their  own  failures. There  was  a  Failure-based  aspect  to  learning  there.
And  another  thing  that  really  impressed  me, a  long  time  ago, was  powers  of  ten.
And  so  I'm  going  to  show  you  a  toy  today, that  I've  been  working  on  that, i  think  of  more  than  anything  else  as  kind  of  a  philosophy  toy  
Now, we  actually  play  through  many  generations  here  at  the  cellular  scale  
But  basically, this  is  the  editor  where  We're  going  to  design  the  next  generation  of  our  creature. So  it  has  a  little  spine.
But  really  the  goal  here  was  within  about  a  minute.
Ok, now, I'll  put  some  hands  on  it.
And  i  can  see  how  it  might  dance  
I  can  also  play  with  the  dynamics  of  this  world  over  time.
And  our  cities  are  going  to  be  at  risk  too  because  a  lot  of  these  are  coastal  cities  
Here  it  is  some  indigenous  life  down  here.
You  see  now  They've  actually  gone  to  tribal  dynamics.
I  think  I'll  leave  before  they  get  hostile  
But  these  are  the  things  that  we  can  kind  of  put  in  this  little  galaxy  here.
Because  i  think  most  of  the  problems  that  our  world  is  facing  right  now  is  the  result  of  short-term  thinking. And  the  fact  that  it  is  so  hard  for  us  to  think  50  100  or  1000  years  out.
And  so  I'm  going  to  talk  a  little  bit  about  that, keeping  in  mind  that  we  have  a  lot  on  the  program  here, 
What's  in  it  for  the  ant  
No  It's  worse  than  that  
There  are  a  lot  of  ideas  to  die  for  
The  secret  of  happiness  is  find  something  more  important  than  you  are  and  dedicate  your  life  to  it.
Actually, i  think  We're  all  responsible  for  not  just  the  intended  effects  of  our  ideas, but  for  their  likely  Misuses  
So  let  me  just  point  out  memes  are  like  viruses, 
And  you  might  think, well, how  can  that  be  
They're  made  of  information  and  can  be  carried  in  any  physical  medium.
Not  just  the  priests, everybody  
After  all  the  meme  for  Shaker-dom  was  essentially  a  sterilizing  parasite  
But  among  all  those  ideas  that  inevitably  flow  out  into  the  whole  world, thanks  to  our  technology, are  a  lot  of  toxic  ideas.
And  It's  not  our  fault  anymore  than  It's  our  fault.
We  drove  to  the  goodwill, and  we  threw  the  sweater  away  somewhat  Ceremoniously, my  idea  being  that  i  would  never  have  to  think  about  the  sweater  nor  see  it  ever  again.
I  tell  that  story  because  it  has  served  and  continues  to  serve  as  a  metaphor  to  me  about  the  level  of  connectedness  that  we  all  have  on  this  earth.
It's, thrilling  
First  she  talked  about  comfort  status, beauty, ,
And  We've  started  making  curtains, and  not  only  is  it  beautiful, but  people  can  see  status  --  that  you  care  about  your  children.
Thank  you  
My  job  depends  upon  it  
Up  to  and  around  about  the  second  world  war  Conductors  were  invariably  dictators  --  these  Tyrannical  figures  who  would  rehearse  not  just  the  orchestra  as  a  whole, but  individuals  within  it  within  an  inch  of  their  lives.
Let's  be  under  no  illusions.
Simply  through  singing  
So  we  got  some  shows  off  the  ground, we  started  touring  them.
One  of  them  was  carmen  
I  want  to  play  you  a  tiny  clip  of  it  now, for  no  other  reason  than  to  give  you  proof  positive  that  there  is  nothing  tiny  about  south  african  music  making  
They  Don't  read  music  
And  yet, ladies  and  gentlemen, every  single  one  of  us  on  this  planet, probably  Engages  with  music  on  a  daily  basis.
I've  got  a  little  experiment  i  want  to  try  with  you  
T: see  It's  the  same  as  f  in  music.
There  i  am  like  a  bloody  windmill  again, you  see  
The  music  will  start.
One  more  time  with  feeling, ladies  and  gentlemen, 
It's  going  to  be  Britain's  first  ever  national  disabled  orchestra.
Clarence, i  would  rather  be  able  to  play  an  instrument  again  than  walk  
I  only  wish  that  some  of  those  musicians  were  here  with  us  today, so  you  could  see  at  firsthand  how  utterly  extraordinary?
If  any  of  you  thinks  you  want  to  help  me  in  any  way  to  achieve  what  is  a  fairly  impossible  and  implausible  dream, still  at  this  point, please, let  me  know

Seventeen  Doesn't  divide  by  two  
The  wise  old  woman  thought  about  their  problem  for  a  long  time. And  finally, she  came  back  and  said, well, i  Don't  know  if  i  can  help  you. But  at  least  if  you  want, you  can  have  my  camel.
They  had  one  camel  left  over  
Now, if  you  think  about  that  story  for  a  moment, i  think  it  resembles  a  lot  of  the  difficult  negotiations.
As  I've  spent  the  last  better  part  of  three  decades, almost  four  traveling  the  world, trying  to  work  getting  involved  in  conflicts, ranging  from  yugoslavia  to  the  middle  east  to  chechnya  to  venezuela, some  of  the  most  difficult  conflicts  on  the  face  of  the  planet  I've  been  asking  myself  that  question  
So, how  do  they  deal  with  their  differences?
But  what  we  Don't  often  see  is  that  There's  always  a  third  side.
Perhaps  the  most  fundamental  way  in  which  the  third  side  can  help  is  to  remind  the  parties  of  What's, really  at  stake  
And  we  met  in  the  Hague  in  the  peace  palace  in  the  same  room, where  the  yugoslav  war  crimes  tribunal  was  taking  place  
And  then  he  went  on, and  then  he  turned  to  me  and  said, You're  an  american  
Now, i  Don't  pretend  to  have  an  answer  to  the  middle  east  conflict.
And  so  my  question  is, yes, Let's  try  and  resolve, the  politics  there  in  the  middle  east. But  Let's  also  take  a  look  at  the  story.
Let's  see  if  we  can  apply  the  third  side  to  it  
What  would  that  mean? What  is  the  story? There?
Now, as  anthropologists, we  know  that  every  culture  has  an  origin  story, 
That  man, of  course, was  abraham  
What's  the  opposite  of  terrorism.
It's  taking  an  innocent  stranger  and  treating  them  as  a  friend, whom  you  welcome  into  your  home  in  order  to  sow  and  create  understanding  or  respect  or  love  
And  That's, what  comes  to  the  first  step  here?
That's, the  essence  of  the  abraham  path, 
So  what  we  discovered  is  that  abraham  is  not  just  a  figure  out  of  a  book  for  those  people.
And  just  a  couple  weeks  ago, there  was  an  Npr  story  on  it.
And  they  quoted  a  villager  who  said  this  walk  connects  us  to  the  world  
She's  partially  blind  her  husband, Can't  work, She's  got  seven  kids, 
And  so  more  and  more  walkers  have  come  and  lately  She's  begun  to  earn  an  income  to  support  her  family, 
So  my  question  is, if  it  can  be  done  in  europe, why  not  in  the  middle  east  
That's, walking  Abraham's  path, 
After  a  tedtalk, why  not  a  Tedwalk  
There's  an  old  african  Proverb  that  goes  when  spider  webs  unite, they  can  halt  even  the  lion  
If  We're  able  to  unite  our  Third-side  webs  of  peace, we  can  even  halt  the  lion  of  war.
Well, what  is  needed  for  the  earliest  possible  warning  of  a  heart  attack  
A  means  to  determine  if  There's  a  complete  blockage  of  a  Coronary  artery  
And  if  we  had  a  computer, put  into  the  body  of  a  person, Who's  at  risk, we  could  know  before  they  even  have  symptoms  that  They're  having  a  heart  attack  to  save  their  life.
And  what  we  tried  with  the  pig  was  external  electrodes  on  the  skin, like  you  see  in  an  emergency  room  and  I'm  going  to  show  you  why  they  Don't  work  very  well  
Next  to  it  at  30  seconds, you  see  this  rise  here.
Then  on  friday  at  643, he  began  to  get  certain  signs, which  later  we  had  the  pig  run  around  --  I'm, not  going  to  go  into  this  early  stage  
Finally, if  You're  lucky, you  are  treated  in  three  or  four  hours  after  the  incident, but  the  heart  muscle  has  died.
And  now  i  want  to  talk  about  something  entirely  different  
So  Here's  a  picture  of  what  We're  doing  
There's  this  migraine  that  is  Preceded  by  a  visual  aura  and  this  visual  aura  by  the  way  --  and  I'll  show  you  a  picture  --  but  it  sort  of  begins  with  little  dancing  lights  gets  bigger  and  bigger  until  it  fills  your  whole  visual  field.
Christina  Sidebottom. Well, my  first  reaction  was  that  it  was  --  looked  awfully  Gun-like, and  it  was  very  strange.
The  most  severe  headaches  responded  better  after  we  did  it  several  times, and  the  unexpected  finding  indicates  that  even  established  headaches, not  only  those  with  aura  get  treated  and  get  diminished.
Well  responsive  electrical  stimulation  means  that  we  sense  at  a  place  in  your  brain, which  is  called  an  epileptic  focus, which  is  where  the  epileptic  seizure  begins  --  we  sense  there  that  It's  going  to  happen. And  then  we  respond  by  applying  an  electrical  energy  at  that  spot, which  Erases  the  Errant  signal. So  that  you  Don't  get  the  clinical  manifestations  of  the  migraine  headache.
That  concludes  my  discussion  of  epilepsy, which  is  the  third  invention  that  i  want  to  discuss  here.
We  want  to  have  some  people  who  really  know  how  to  do  this  perform  human  engineering  studies  to  develop  the  optimum  design  for  the  portable  device  for  treating  migraine  headaches.
And  that  is  the  second  wish  
We  needed  to  take  what  we  had  built  and  create  a  platform  out  of  it, so  that  it  could  be  used  elsewhere  in  the  world.
And  so  there  is  a  team  of  developers  from  all  over  africa  who  are  part  of  this  team  now  --  from  ghana  from  malawi  from  kenya, 
What  is  the  Veracity  level  of  what  You're  looking  at  
So  You've  got  a  lot  of  information  That's, great  ,
Take  the  crowd  and  apply  them  to  the  information  
And  we  are  very  happy  to  be  part  of  the  ted  family.
It's  inevitable  terrible. But  really  what  i  want  to  talk  about  is  I'm  just  fascinated  by  the  legacy. People  leave  when  they  die.
A  value  for  things  with  a  personal  touch  --  an  Autograph  book, a  Soul-searching  letter  
If  a  fraction  of  this  powerful  ted  audience  could  be  inspired  to  buy  a  beautiful  paper  --  john  It'll, be  a  recycled  one  --  and  write  a  beautiful  letter  to  someone  they  love. We  actually  may  start  a  revolution  where  our  children  may  go  to  Penmanship  classes.
So  what  do  i  plan  to  leave  for  my  son  
I  plan  to  publish  my  own  notebook.
I  have  no  idea  how  I'm  going  to  do  it, but  i  am  committed  to  compiling  his  thoughts  and  mine  into  a  book  and  leave  that  published  book  for  my  son  
What's  happened  in  the  music  world  is  There's  a  culture  or  an  ecosystem  That's  been  created  that  if  you  take  some  words  from  apple, the  Catchphrase  that  we  create  rip  mix  and  burn  
And  what  That's  done  is  It's  created  like, i  said, a  vibrant  community, That's, very  inclusive, with  people  continually  working  to  connect  musical  ideas, innovate  them  and  keep  things  constantly  up  to  date.
Imagine  making  it  free, so  that  anyone  in  the  world  can  have  access  to  all  of  this  knowledge  and  imagine  using  information  technology, so  that  you  can  update  this  content, improve  it  play  with  it  on  a  timescale  That's  more  on  the  order  of  seconds.
In  fact, a  lot  of  this  use  coming  from  unites  states  K-through-12  schools  because  anyone  Who's  involved  in  a  school  scale  back  the  first  thing. That's  cut  is  the  music  curriculum. And  so  this  is  just  indicating  the  tremendous  thirst  for  this  kind  of  open  free  content.
We've  been  working  with  amd, which  has  a  project  called  50  by  '15, which  is  trying  to  bring  internet  connectivity  to  50  percent  of  the  World's  population  by  2015  
In  particular, a  bunch  of  the  projects  that  are  funded  by  hewlett  foundation  who  have  taken  a  real  leadership  role  in  this  area  of  open  content.
Ok  burn.
How  much  would  it  cost  in  a  bookstore  
Why  does  it  cost  22  dollars?
Remember  we  took  the  book, tore  the  pages  out, 
Imagine  music  xml  that  actually  lets  you  delve  into  the  semantic  structure  of  music  play  with  it.
Even  the  three  wise  men  
Because  We're  saying  that  anybody  can  contribute  things  to  this  commons, anybody  can  contribute  anything  
So  thanks  very  much  
I've  been  at  mit  for  44  years, i  went  to  ted, i  
Everybody  agrees  that  whatever  the  solutions  are  to  the  big  problems, they  include  education, sometimes  can  be  just  education  and  can  never  be  without  some  element  of  education.
So  with  those  as  the  principles  --  some  of  you  may  know, seymour  papert. This  is  back  in  1982.
Here, We're  in  the  '80s  
And  these  kids, their  first  english  word  is  google, and  they  only  know  skype  They've, never  heard  of  telephony.
Screw  you  go  to  the  back  of  the  line  and  someone  else  will  do  it.
And  the  idea  is  to  launch  with  enough  scale  that  the  scale  itself  helps  bring  the  price  down  and  That's.
Now  once  people  start  looking  at  this, they  say, ah, this  is  a  laptop  project.
Because  laptop  economics  are  the  following. I   say, 50  percent  here  It's  more  like  60, 60  percent  of  the  cost  of  your  laptop  is  sales. Marketing  distribution  and  profit.
Ok, I've  been  using  laptops  since  their  inception  
The  Dual  mode  display  --  the  idea  is  to  have  a  display  that  both  works  outdoors  --  Isn't  it  fun  using  your  cell  phone  outdoors  in  the  sunlight, 
And  in  about  30  days, We'll  know  for  sure  whether  this  works  
Probably  the  most  important  piece  there  is  that  the  kids  really  can  do  the  maintenance  
So  this  is  just  a  mechanical  engineering, sort  of  embodiment  of  it  for  you  to  play  with  
Everybody  thinks  they  know  about  education.
Well  guess  what  We're  not  
Because  There's  no  market  for  post  office  trucks, 
You  can  spray  paint  it, you  can  do  anything  you  want.
That  came  from  a  1960  paper  on  space  travel. Because  if  you  think  about  it  space  is  pretty  awkward.
He  said, no, no, no  Here's, a  better  way.
And  he  said, well, okay, 
And  if  you  were  able  to  print  out  everybody  in  your  cell  phone, the  room  would  be  very  crowded.
These  are  the  people  that  you  have  access  to  right  now  in  general  --  all  of  these  people  all  of  your  friends  and  family  that  you  can  connect  to  
But  when  you  actually  visualize  it, all  the  connections  that  We're  doing  right  now  --  this  is  an  image  of  the  mapping  of  the  internet  --  it  Doesn't  look  technological  
It  actually  looks  very  organic  
It's  that  They're  helping  us  to  be  more  human  helping  us  to  connect  with  each  other  
We're  just  increasing  our  Humanness  and  our  ability  to  connect  with  each  other, regardless  of  geography.
So  That's, why  i  study  cyborg  anthropology.
And  people  are  initially  reluctant  to  tell  you  
We  talk  about  things  in  relative  terms, 
And  so  when  we  look  at  these  pmtct  programs, what  does  it  mean? ?
Imagine  yourself  if  you  can  You're  a  young  woman  in  africa, You're  going  to  the  hospital  or  clinic  
And  you  Don't  know  who  you  can  talk  to  because  the  truth  is  hiv  is  so  stigmatizing  that  if  you  partner  your  family, anyone  in  your  home  You're  likely  to  be  thrown  out  without  any  means  of  support  
And  this  --  this  is  the  face  and  story  of  hiv  in  africa  today, 
But  We're  here  to  talk  about  possible  solutions  and  some  good  news  
Our  organization  Mothers2mothers  Enlists  women  with  hiv  as  care  providers.
But  if  you  wanted  to  understand  what  that  surgery  would  do  to  your  life  You'd  like  to  engage  someone  someone  Who's  had  the  procedure  
And  so  doctors  and  nurses  --  they  look  up  to  them  as  experts  
Men  are  not  frequently  part  of  pregnancy  care.
And  this  is  so  important  in  breaking  through  the  stigma  
And  if  we  can  change  enough  communities, we  can  change  national  attitudes.
We  have  the  medicines  we  have  the  tests, but  how  do  you  reduce  the  stigma  
I've  been  afraid  to  tell  everybody  
How  do  you  build  a  better  health  care  system?
And  our  organization  helps  women  across  that  bridge  
The  program  is  now  working  in  nine  countries. We  have  670  program  sites  We're  seeing  about  230000  women  every  month  We're  employing  1600, mentor  mothers.
All  of  this  is  possible, if  we  each  contribute  to  this  fight  ,
Thank  you  
Then  they  Irradiate  our  food, trying  to  make  it  last  longer.
This  man, joel  Salatin, they  call  him  a  lunatic  farmer  because  he  grows  against  the  system.
Since  I'm  Home-schooled, i  went  to  go  hear  him  speak.
I  want  you  to  know  that  there  are  Farmers'  markets  in  every  community  popping  up  
Not  too  long  ago, my  uncle  said  that  he  offered  my  six-year-old  cousin  cereal  
Now, we  had  a  harvard  professor  here  --  she  was  from  harvard.
The  scales  here  are  religiosity  from  zero  percent  or  atheist  to  100  percent  bible  literally  true  
Now, Let's  talk  about  some  of  the  characteristics  that  are  important  for  this  revolutionary  device.
First  of  all, it  needs  to  be  small  
Now, i  bought  this  device  from  Clifford  Stoll  for  about  900  bucks.
Free  bird: 
Ok, one  more  time  --  I'm  just  going  to  give  you  a  little  help  
And  finally, We're  going  to  put  the  Marriott  hotel  and  the  Portola  plaza  on  the  top  
Mr  vice  president, i  wish  i  knew  how  to  quit  you  
And  sylvia  earle, and  i  were  on  an  expedition  in  this  submarine, 20  years  ago, in  japan, 
But  when  i  got  there, i  found  lots  of  plastic  garbage  and  other  debris.
It's  in  the  Mid-pacific  It's  about  five  days  from  anywhere  
So  That's, when  i  first  learned  of  the  islands  and  had  no  idea  what  i  was  getting  into  
It's  a  very  Deep-water  part  of  our  planet.
But  we  got  up  there, and  i  had  the  unique  and  wonderful  scientific  opportunity  and  personal  opportunity  to  get  to  a  place  that  had  never  been  dived  and  just  get  to  an  island  and  go.
Let's  try  there  and  then  falling  into  the  water  
The  phoenix  islands  and  all  the  equatorial  parts  of  our  planet  are  very  important  for  tuna  fisheries, especially  this  yellowfin  tuna  that  you  see  here.
So  i  thought  the  scenes  of  never-ending  wilderness  would  go  on  forever, but  they  did. Finally  come  to  an  end.
They  basically  are  one  nation  that  controls  most  of  the  equatorial  waters  of  the  central  pacific  ocean  
And  for  some  reason  they  Didn't  want  me  to  come  or  it  was  hard  to  find  a  time  and  a  place, and  it  took  a  while.
And  i  was  free  for  dinner, and  i  went  out  to  dinner  with  the  minister  of  fisheries  in  kiribati.
It  had  occurred  on  land  in  rainforests  of  south  america  and  africa  where  Landowners  had  been  paid  not  to  cut  the  trees  down  
So  we  had  very  strong  leadership, very  good  vision.
So  suddenly  we  had  this  area  that  we  were  protecting, but  now  it  appeared  to  be  dead, at  least  in  the  coral  areas  
And  That's  the  story  with  Climate-change  heating  
And  we  are  now  in  the  process  of  raising  the  full  Endowment  
And  i  actually  went  to  see  some  of  the  design  companies  in  hong  kong  in  my  stay  there.
And  I'll  just  give  you  one  example, i  had  gotten  my  first  Walkman  
Last  november, a  museum  opened  in  tokyo, called  the  Mori  museum  in  a  skyscraper  up  on  the  56th  floor.
And  for  sure, i  Haven't  looked  at  the  sky  in  the  same  way  after  spending  an  hour  in  there  
You  know, one  is  just  working  without  pressure  
This  is, you  know, related  to  it  getting  out  of  the  studio  
Again, we  could  supply  the  content  for  it.
Icons  like  batman, superman  wonder  woman. And  their  colleagues  will  be  teaming  up  with  icons.
As  christian  Iconography  got  changed  and  Swastikas  were  created  out  of  Crucifixes  batman.
Superman  is  not  only  sent  to  earth  from  the  heavens  or  krypton.
So  33  of  the  stones  are  smuggled  onto  the  nina, the  Pinta  and  the  santa  maria  and  are  spread  in  the  new  world.
To  which  he  said, let  them  be  because  what  They're  giving  us  is  worth  a  lot  more  than  what  We're, paying  them  
So  these  99  stones  a  few  kind  of  rules  in  the  game  number  one: you  Don't  choose  the  stone.
Well, 
We  have  jabbar  from  saudi  who  starts  breaking  things  when  he  has  the  power  
I'm, like  are  all  the  girls  going  to  be  kind  and  merciful  and  the  guys  all  strong  
That's, not  timely  
And  that  led  to  all  kinds  of  things  from  being  in  curricula  in  universities  and  schools  to  --  one  of  my  favorite  pictures  i  have  from  south  asia.
Opened  a  theme  park  through  a  license  in  kuwait  a  year  and  a  half  ago, called  the  99  village  theme  park  --  300000  square  feet, 20  rides  all  with  our  characters, a  couple  Back-to-school  licenses  in  spain  and  turkey, 
Rughal  there  must  be  something  we  can  do  
Dr: Razem  It's  time  to  go.
You  are  noora  the  light  
I  Don't  deserve  it.
Jabbar, We're  here  to  help  you  
Miklos, no, he  gave  me  access, and  you  want  to  reboot  the  [unclear], no  more  [unclear]  
As  the  father  of  five  sons, i  worry  about  who  They're  going  to  be  using  as  role  models.
And  Torture's  a  terrible  enough  thing  as  it  is.
Now, one  of  the  things  that  i  refer  to  when  i  --  about  the  importance  of  this  message  --  is  that  i  gave  a  lecture  at  the  medical  school  at  kuwait  university, where  i  lecture  on  the  biological  basis  of  behavior. And  i  gave  the  students  two  articles  one  from  the  new  york  times.
Any  boys  and  girls  caught  flirting  would  get  married  off  immediately.
The  second  one  took  place  in  upstate  new  york  
She  was  actually  coming  out  of  an  amnesty  international  meeting  
And  the  good  news  is  there  might  be  an  easy  solution  to  that  and  That's  using  our  eyes, more  
And  it  Mushroomed  slightly  afghanistan  and  iraq  Mushroomed.
So  there  it  is, 227  billion  is  what  africa  Owes  
And  the  recent  financial  crisis, how  much  of  this  diagram  might  that  figure  take  up  
We  need  to  imagine  what  a  landscape  of  the  World's  fears  might  look  like  
This  is  mountains  out  of  Molehills, a  timeline  of  global  media.
And  There's  a  very  interesting  and  odd  pattern  hidden  in  this  data  that  you  can  only  see  when  you  visualize  it  
Let  me  show  you  this  
I'll, take  answers  
I  wonder  if  i  could  make  my  life  beautiful  ,
It's  the  language  of  the  eye  
But  of  course, china  has  an  enormous  population  
And  if  it  can  do  that, maybe  it  can  also  change  your  behavior.
But  what  it  points  to  is  that  visualizing  information  like  this  is  a  form  of  knowledge, compression, 
So  heart  is  filtered  out.
So  the  data  is  now  alive.
It's  even  fun  to  engage  with  them  because  It's  visual  
And  that  is  beautiful.
I  will  show  it  to  you  
The  top  note  that  you  smelled  at  the  very  beginning, the  Cut-grass  green, what  we  call  in  perfumery  --  They’re, weird  terms  --  and  this  would  be  called  a  green  note  because  it  smells  of  something  green  like  cut  grass.
This  is  Cis-3-hexene-1-ol, and  i  had  to  learn  chemistry  on  the  fly  in  the  last  three  years, a  very  expensive  high  school  chemistry, education, 
Now, this  is  a  totally  insane  idea.
And  my  definition  of  a  theory  is  It’s, not  just  something  that  you  teach  people  It’s  labor, saving  
If  it  does  you  put  the  glass  down, you  go  to  a  different  bar.
Now, i  showed  this  to  a  physicist  friend  of  mine  who  has  a  profound  Distaste  for  biology. And  he  says, That’s, easy.
Now  fact, b, nothing  in  the  world  has  that  frequency, except  s-h, 
And  in  an  enormous  40-page  paper  in  german, he  says, at  one  point  --  my  wife  is  german  and  she  translated  it  for  me  --  and  at  one  point, he  says, Ganz, Widerlich, Geruch, an  absolutely  Repulsive  smell, which  is  good  reminiscent  of  hydrogen  sulfide.
And  It’s  fair  to  say  that  if  you  look  up  Somebody’s  nose, You’re  unlikely  to  see  anything  resembling  this  
Ok, now, if  something  absorbs  the  energy, the  electron  can  travel  
What’s  nice  about  this  idea, if  you  have  a  philosophical  bent  of  mind, is  that  then  it  tells  you  that  the  nose  the  ear  and  the  eye  are  all  vibrational, senses.
He  says  to  me, i  bet  you  Cannot  make  a  coumarin  
Now, coumarin  is  a  very  common  thing. A   material  in  fragrance, which  is  derived  from  a  bean  that  comes  from  south  america.
And  You’re  completely  wrong  and  I’m  sure  You’re  completely  wrong.
Working  with  the  harvard  business  school, You'll  see, this  example, when  you  talk  about  minimum  payment, if  you  spent  62  dollars  for  a  meal, the  longer  you  take  to  pay  out  that  loan.
But  It's  going  to  work  It's  more  effective  than  just  computational  aids  
Received  very  Favorably  by  business  
And  there  is  some  good  news  to  report  today.
There  is  no  way  we  should  do  business  with  companies  that  have  agreements  with  stealth  provisions.
Now, we  come  down  to  it  relatives, grieving, 
Never  retreat  to  the  'glorious  Past', keep  to  the  track  to  the  beaten  track, treat  every  day  of  your  life  as  your  last  
Never  acknowledge  the  ghost  on  the  stair  
Don't: do  it  
You  bodies  are  wonderful  as  they  are  
Youth  can  never  come  again.
Dearest  do  i  love  thee?
Do  i  shrink  from  thy  Caress  
Lady  lady: do  not  weep  --  what  is  gone  is  gone?
What  of  the  titans  of  media  
And  what  of  the  constitution  that  Bully  of  last  resort, 
At  30, my  powers  seemed  mighty  to  me  
Grown  sick  to  our  stomachs  and  sick  of  our  lives.
Um, there  are  --  I've  got  far  too  much  money. And  i  have  far  too  much  fun  in  my  businesses.
I  was  in  a  clinic, i  Wasn't  allowed  to  make  telephone  calls  
That  was  in  october  of  2000  
But  sometimes  i  try  to  put  myself  in  an  evil  Man's  position, 
But  sometimes  i  try  to  put  myself  in  that  position.
But  It's  interesting  to  me, i  love  to  write  historical  verse  
I  love  to  think  what  they  thought  what  it  was  like  
We're  still  doing  it  with  all  of  the  genius  assembled  in  this  room, 
And  you  stay  up  for  12  
But  always  we  Scrabbled  to  lie  with  her  first  
We  are  one  species  of  about  five  and  a  half  thousand  mammalian  species  that  exist  on  planet  earth  today, 
You  then  hope  that  the  earth  moves  in  such  a  way  as  to  bring  the  bones  back  up  to  the  surface.
In  fact, if  you  go  back  in  time, it  is  the  norm  that  there  are  multiple  species  of  hominids, or  of  human  ancestors  that  coexist  at  any  one  time.
And  i  imagined  him  to  be  tall  Dark-skinned  
We  began  to  find  limb  bones.
But  also  surprising  finds  recently  announced  from  the  island  of  Flores  in  indonesia, where  a  group  of  these  human  ancestors  have  been  isolated  and  have  become  dwarfed  and  They're  only  about  a  meter  in  height.
And  what  is  it  that  really  makes  us  us  
I  think  It's  our  collective  intelligence, 
I  had  saved  a  few  hundred  photos  of  dodo  skeletons  into  my  creative  projects  folder  --  It's  a  repository  for  my  brain, everything  that  i  could  possibly  be  interested  in  
Assuming  it  was  roughly  the  size  of  my  Wife's  hand, i  made  some  measurements  of  her  thumb, and  i  scaled  them  out  to  the  size  of  the  skull.
Built  out  of  words. It  is  the  engine  that  drives  the  plot  of  his  book. And  also  the  movie  in  which  another  object  is  created  a  prop  that  has  to  represent  the  thing  that  hammett  created  out  of  words  inspired  by  the  Kniphausen  hawk.
And  so  now  it  was  time  to  do  some  research  
What  do  they  do? How  do  you  start  something  like  that?
And  I'm  following  all  the  light  kicks  on  this  thing  and  making  sure  that  as  I'm  holding  the  light  in  the  same  position, I'm  getting  the  same  type  of  reflection  on  it  --  That's  the  level  of  detail  I'm  going  into  this  thing.
This  thing  was  made  of  resin, and  it  was  too  light  
That's  half  the  weight  of  my  dog, Huxley  
On  the  far  left  is  a  piece  of  crap  --  a  replica  i  bought  on  ebay.
So  what  do  i  do?
One  i  can  fire  a  freaking  laser  at  it, which  i  have  already  done  to  do  a  3d  scan  --  There's, a  3d  scan  of  this  falcon.
But  really, if  We're  all  going  to  be  honest  with  ourselves, i  have  to  admit  that  achieving  the  end  of  the  exercise  was  never  the  point  of  the  exercise  to  begin  with.
It  was  actually  developed  for  use  by  the  offshore  oil  industry  for  diving  on  oil  Rigs, down  to  a  depth  of  2000  feet  
If  i  go  out  in  the  open  ocean  environment  virtually  anywhere  in  the  world, and  i  drag  a  net  from  3000  feet  to  the  surface, most  of  the  animals  --  in  fact, in  many  places, 80  to  90  percent  of  the  animals  that  i  bring  up  in  that  net  --  make  light  
So  you  turn  on  the  camera, turn  out  the  lights  
I  knew  my  forward  speed, i  knew  the  area.
So  it  uses  its  red, bioluminescence  like  a  Sniper's, scope  to  be  able  to  sneak  up  on  animals  that  are  blind  to  red  light  and  be  able  to  see  them  without  being  seen  
And  a  lot  of  animals  will  use  their  bioluminescence  as  a  lure  
So  She's  got  a  lure  that  she  sticks  out  in  front  of  this  living  mousetrap  of  Needle-sharp  teeth  in  order  to  attract  in  some  Unsuspecting  prey  
So  now, we  believe  that  the  different  shape  of  the  lure  is  how  the  male  recognizes  the  female  in  the  Anglerfish  world. Because  many  of  these  males  are  what  are  known  as  dwarf. Males.
Well, this  is  a  deep-sea  version  of  Women's  Lib  
She  always  knows  where  he  is, and  she  Doesn't  have  to  be  Monogamous.
And  we  were  using  a  special  trawling  net  that  we  were  able  to  bring  these  animals  up  alive.
This  is  an  unbelievable  light  show  
So  I've  wanted  for  a  long  time  to  figure  out  a  different  way  to  explore  
That's  me  on  the  left, my  graduate  student  at  the  time, Erika  Raymond  and  lee  fry, who  was  the  engineer  on  the  project  
We're  at  the  edge  of  the  brine  pool, There's  a  fish  That's  swimming  towards  the  camera  
Dna  design  nature  art.
All  the  guys  in  the  Rugby  team, Couldn't  understand. But  anyway  --  this  is  a  meringue. This  is  another  sample.
It  shows  how  you  make  one  holistic  form  like  the  car  industry. And  then  you  break  up  what  you  need.
It's  like  21st-century  henry  moore, when  you  see  a  henry  moore, still  your  hair  stands  up, There's, some  amazing, spiritual, connect  
We  need  to  be  in  that  realm. I   want  to  do  stuff  like  that.
This  is  two  weeks  ago  in  Ccp, in  Coventry  who  build  parts  for  Bentleys  and  so  on  
This  is  what  goes  on  in  my  studio  everyday. I   walk  --  I'm  traveling.
I  said, you  get  into  biopolymers, they  looked  straight  through  me.
I've  had  this  image  of  a  water  droplet  for  20  years, sitting  on  a  hot  bed  
You  see  that  thing  you  do  
I'm, not  putting  charles  Eames'  furniture  in  buildings  anymore.
Who  cares  
This  is  called  a  Plasnet  
These  are  my  sculptures  
This  is  a  room  of  Sleep-deprived  women, 
And  in  the  course  of  that, i  studied, i  met  with  medical  doctors  scientists  and  I'm  here  to  tell  you  that  the  way  to  a  more  productive  more  inspired  more  joyful. Life  is  getting  enough  sleep.
And  our  guide  was  a  local  science  teacher: 
At  the  end  of  this  day, i  could  have  filled  a  book  just  with  stories  about  law  from  this  one  teacher: 
We  lack  even  a  vocabulary  to  deal  with  this  problem  and  That's, because  we  have  the  wrong  frame  of  reference.
The  trial  lawyers  say, well, this  legal  fear  makes  doctors  practice, better  medicine, 
The  fear  has  Chilled  professional  interaction  so  thousands  of  tragic  errors  occur  because  doctors  are  afraid  to  speak  up. Are  you  sure  That's? The  right? Dosage?
It  goes  on. We  did  a  study  of  all  the  rules  that  affect  one  school  in  new  york.
I  mean, It's  just  absolutely  a  formula  for  failure.
And  why  not  they  Don't  trust  the  law?
Well, how  do  you  fix  it? We  could  spend  10000  lifetimes  trying  to  prune  this  legal  jungle.
But  law  is  different  than  other  kinds  of  Uncertainties, because  it  carries  with  it  the  power  of  state  
If  you  make  people  self-conscious  about  their  judgments  studies  show  you  will  make  them  make  worse  judgments.
Edison  stated  it  best. He  said, hell? We  Ain't  got  no  rules  around  here.
All  these  choices  involve  value  judgments  and  social  norms, not  objective.
You  Can't  run  a  society  by  the  lowest  common  denominator: 
So  What's  needed  is  a  basic  shift  in  philosophy.
Law  is  a  human  institution. Responsibility  is  a  human  institution.
If  the  judge  Doesn't  have  the  authority  to  toss  out  unreasonable  claims  then  all  of  us  go  through  the  day, looking  over  our  shoulders  
What  the  world  needs  now  is  to  restore  the  authority  to  make  common  choices, 
The  second  thing  i  want  to  do  is  introduce  my  co-author  and  dear  friend  and  Co-teacher  
We  certainly  Can't  trust, the  bankers  and  we  certainly  Can't  trust, the  Brokers  
And  even  as  we  do  our  own  work, all  too  often, we  find  ourselves  having  to  choose  between  doing  what  we  think  is  the  right  thing  and  doing  the  expected  thing, or  the  required  thing, or  the  profitable  thing.
Or  if  they  do  have  our  interests  at  heart, we  worry  that  they  Don't  know  us  well  enough  to  figure  out  what  they  need  to  do  in  order  to  allow  us  to  secure  those  interests  
In  addition, we  are  struggling  to  find  some  way  to  create  incentives  for  people  in  the  financial  services  industry  that  will  have  them  more  interested  in  serving  the  long-term  interests  even  of  their  own  companies, rather  than  securing  short-term  profits.
If  there  is  a  lesson  to  be  learned  from  the  financial  collapse, it  is  that  
A  wise  person  knows  when  to  bend  the  rules, 
A  wise  person  knows  when  to  improvise  
And  most  important, a  wise  person, does  this  improvising  and  Rule-bending  in  the  service  of  the  right  aims?
He  was  supporting  his  wife  and  a  child, and  the  child  was  going  to  parochial  school.
Then  he  lost  his  job  
The  judge  on  the  case, judge  Lois  forer  thought  that  this  made  no  sense  
He  did  he  served  out  his  sentence.
For  ms  dewey  this  Isn't, why  she  became  a  teacher  
In  the  Veterans'  court  --  this  was  the  first  of  its  kind  in  the  united  states.
Why  has  the  idea  spread?
Anyone  would  Glom  onto  a  criminal  justice  system  that  has  this  kind  of  a  record  
So  Here's  is  a  System-changer, and  it  seems  to  be  catching  
Aristotle  thought  that  practical  wisdom  was  the  key  to  happiness, and  he  was  right  
Indeed, we  argue  there  is  no  substitute  for  wisdom.
First  of  all, we  started  off  the  nuclear  age  in  1945  
We  had  a  few  nuclear  weapons, two  of  which  we  dropped  on  japan  in  hiroshima.
So  the  goal  was  to  evacuate  the  target  cities  
We  would  move  people  out  of  the  target  cities  into  the  countryside  
This  disconnect  was  never  actually  resolved  
So  what  is  a  nuclear  terror  threat?
There  are  plans  for  how  to  create  a  terror  farm  where  you  could  actually  manufacture  and  develop  all  the  components  and  assemble  it  
Since  there  is  no  real  Retribution  possible  that  would  make  any  difference  since  there  are  people  willing  to  actually  give  up  their  lives  in  order  to  do  a  lot  of  damage  to  us. It  becomes  apparent  that  the  whole  notion  of  this  mutually  assured  destruction  would  not  work.
You  take  it  wherever  you  want  to  take  it, and  you  can  Detonate  it  
You  Can't  get  an  exact  number  for  that  kind  of  probability. But  what  I'm  trying  to  say  is  that  we  have  all  the  elements  of  that  happening.
I  Don't  think  we  would  see  an  all-out  nuclear  war  any  time  soon, although  even  that  is  not  completely  off  the  table.
There's  still  enough  nuclear  weapons  in  the  Arsenals  of  the  superpowers  to  destroy  the  earth, many  many  times  over  
We're  coming  down, and  we  bring  that  truck  that  you  just  saw  somewhere  in  here  in  the  financial  district  
This  is  a  10-kiloton  bomb, slightly  smaller  than  was  used  in  hiroshima. And  i  want  to  just  conclude  this  by  just  giving  you  some  information. I   think  --  news  you  could  use  kind  of  concept  here.
And  if  You're  in  this  vicinity, You've  got  to  get  away  
And  if  You're  wearing  clothing, You've  taken  off  your  clothing, You're  going  to  get  showered  down  some  place  and  remove  the  radiation  that  would  be  --  the  radioactive  material  that  might  be  on, you  
Thank  you  
No, no, i  Wasn't  14  years  old  
I  Wasn't, really  a  rocket  scientist.
And  he  told  me  Biosignatures, we  need  to  look  for  a  Biosignature  
And  he  said, It's  any  measurable  phenomenon  that  allows  us  to  indicate  the  presence  of  life.
But  immediately  the  system  goes  like  what  kind  of  dumb  piece  of  code  was  this  
So  you  see  waves  of  new  types, taking  over  the  other  types.
As  long  as  i  know  that  There's, some  sort  of  alphabet, 
And  obviously, each  of  these  letters  comes  off  about  roughly  equally  frequent  ,
And  if  i  look  at  french  texts, it  looks  a  little  bit  different  or  italian  or  german  
It  Doesn't  matter  whether  It's  a  poem  or  whether  It's  a  mathematical  text: 
The  Avidians  being  the  denizens  of  this  computer  world  where  they  are  perfectly  happy  replicating  and  growing  in  complexity, 
Too  hot, too  hot  
And  I'm  just  showing  this  to  you  again  because  It's.
One  of  them  is, if  we  are  able  to  think  about  life  in  abstract  terms  --  and  We're, not  talking  about  things  like  plants  and  We're, not  talking  about  amino  acids  and  We're, not  talking  about  bacteria.
But  what  really  turns  me  on  about  technology  is  not  just  the  ability  to  get  more  songs  on  mp3  players  
What  i  would  like  to  see  is  idealism  Decoupled  from  all  constraints  
Political  economic  psychological, whatever  
Don't: ask  
Well, i  turned  him  down  
That's, not  a  cause  That's  an  emergency  
And  what  We're  facing  in  africa  is  an  unprecedented  threat  to  human  dignity  and  equality  
That's  right  
We  like  to  give  and  we  give  a  lot  
You  see  africa  makes  a  fool  of  our  idea  of  justice.
Africa  is  a  continent  in  flames.
Anyway, i  believe  that  that  kind  of  thinking  Offends  the  intellectual  Rigor  in  this  room  
There's  an  opportunity  here  and  It's, real  ,
Our  credibility  
I  Can't, you  Can't  as  individuals, but  we  can  change  the  world.
But  working  together, we  can  actually  change  the  world.
Ideas  that  you  gestated  in  your  youth  ,
Well  now, actually, because  of  you, it  is  possible  to  change  the  physical  world.
So  why  then  are  we  not  pumping  our  fists  into  the  air?
But  for  the  first  time  in  history, we  have  the  technology  we  have  the  know-how, we  have  the  cash.
The  clash  wore  big  army  boots, not  sandals  
But  some  of  them, they  Haven't  
Not  only  in  lives  saved, but  in  goodwill  stability  and  security  that  We'll  gain  
What  i  hope  is  that  beyond  individual  merciful  acts  that  you  will  tell  the  politicians  to  do  right  by  africa  by  america  and  by  the  world, 
Give  us  that  kind  of  dreaming  that  kind  of  doing  
The  war  against  terror, yes, 
Actually  We're  talking  to  abc  today, about  the  Oscars  
We  need  to  get  the  math. We  need  to  get  the  statistics  out  to  the  american  people.
One  by  one, they  step  forward, a  nurse, a  teacher, a  Homemaker  and  lives  are  saved  
We  can  make  history  
We  can  start  to  make  poverty  history.
The  idea  that  the  internet, which  changed  all  of  our  lives  can  transform  a  country  --  and  a  continent  that  has  hardly  made  it  to  analog.
Communication  is  very  important  for  ethiopia  --  will  transform  the  country  
I  am, of  course, referring  to  none  other  than  elvis  Presley  
And  love  is  not  love.
Does  that  correspond  
Metaphor  creates  a  kind  of  conceptual  synesthesia  in  which  we  understand  one  concept  in  the  context  of  another  
One  of  the  sentences  was  some  jobs  are  jails.
And  they  had  those  expectations  because  agent  metaphors  imply  the  deliberate  action  of  a  living  thing, pursuing  a  goal  
But  there  is  a  better  translation.
The  latin  word  cogito  is  derived  from  the  Prefix  Co  meaning  together  and  the  verb, Agitare  meaning  to  shake  
And  in  that  sense, ballooning  is  a  beautiful  metaphor  
We  want  to  go  in  a  direction, but  the  winds  push  us  in  another  direction, like  in  life.
And  as  long  as  we  fight  horizontally  against  life  against  the  winds  against  What's  happening  to  us, life  is  a  nightmare.
How  do  we  go  from  the  metaphor  to  something  more  practical  that  we  can  really  use  every  day  
It's, not  true  
This  is  very  practical  
This  is  why  you  need  people  with  long-term  vision, 
But  we  were  expected  to  have  doubts  We're  expected  to  have  fears  
It's  to  show  you  how  much  gas  was  left  in  the  last  bottles  
We  landed  with  40  kilos  
I  had  no  idea  how  it  was  possible.
And  when  the  capsule  of  my  balloon  was  introduced  officially  in  the  air  and  space  museum  in  washington  together  with  the  airplane  of  charles  lindbergh, with  apollo  11  with  the  wright  Brothers'  flyer  with  chuck  Yeager's  61, i  had  really  a  thought  then  
It  will  be  prohibited  because  We'll  have  to  save  our  natural  resources  in  a  few  decades  from  now  
Which  means  that  they  have  more  proven  the  limits  of  renewable  energies  than  the  potential  of  it.
The  goal  is  to  take  off  end  of  this  year  for  the  first  test.
So  you  see  that  this  airplane  is  more  a  symbol  
I  Don't  think  it  will  transport  200  people  in  the  next  years.
And  20  years  later, there  were  200  people  in  every  airplane  crossing  the  atlantic  
And  each  time  we  have  some  ice  in  the  future, we  have  to  know  that  life  will  be  great. And  the  success  will  be  brilliant  if  we  dare  to  overcome  our  fear  of  the  ice  to  go  through  the  obstacle  to  go  through  the  problem. In  order  to  see  what  there  is  on  the  other  side.
I  wish  i  could  show  you  my  yemen  
It  was  very  hard, you  know  to  impose  my  authority, 
But  a  Woman's  got  to  do  what  a  Woman's  got  to  do  
It's  about  proving  who  you  are, and  what  you  can  do  
But  in  assuming  this  responsibility  and  going  about  it  as  you  have, you  have  become  a  bridge  between  an  older  and  traditional  society. And  the  one  that  you  are  now  creating  at  the  paper.
And  this  is  true  
Well, the  yemen  times  across  20  years  has  been  through  so  much  
They  think  that  if  There's  anything  against  them, then  we  are  being  an  opposition  newspaper.
And  very, very  difficult  times  
And  he  ended  up  writing  about  a  story  that  even  surprised  me  --  hip  hop  --  that  there  are  young  yemeni  men  who  express  themselves  through  dancing  and  Puchu  Puchu  
That  thing  
I'm, not  so  old  
Actually  That's  a  documentary  That's  available  online, the  Video's  online  
And  certainly  you  yourself  and  what  you  do  have  given  us  a  view  of  the  future  that  we  will  embrace  and  be  grateful  for  
On  twitter  also  
And  it  Doesn't  take  much  time  to  discover  some  really  astonishing  statistics  with  this  issue.
It's  the  number  one  contaminant  of  Groundwater  drinking  water  rain  water, 
In  some  cases, another  species  like  the  north  american  leopard  frog  showed  that  males  exposed  to  atrazine, grew  eggs  in  their  testes.
Normally  the  testes  should  make  testosterone.
In  fact, this  aromatase  is  so  important  in  breast  cancer  that  the  latest  treatment  for  breast  cancer  is  a  chemical  called  Letrozole, which  blocks  aromatase, blocks  estrogen.
Pjc, so  speaking  of  estrogen, one  of  the  other  compounds  that  tyrone  talks  about  in  the  film  is  something  called  bisphenol  a  bpa, which  has  been  in  the  news  recently, 
So  We're  Dosing, our  babies, our  Newborns, our  infants  with  a  synthetic  estrogen, 
So  the  pup  you  see  on  the  bottom  is  affected  by  atrazine, that  its  grandmother  was  exposed  to  
And  given  the  life  of  many  of  these  chemicals  generations  years  dozens  of  years, that  means  that  we  right  now  are  affecting  the  health  of  our  Grandchildren's  grandchildren  by  things  that  We're  putting  into  the  environment  today, 
And  this  was  something  that  was  really  brought  home  to  me  a  year  ago. When  i  found  out  i  was  pregnant. And  the  first  scan  revealed  that  my  baby  had  a  birth  defect  associated  with  exposure  to  Estrogenic  chemicals  in  the  womb.
We  know  so  much  about  global  warming  and  climate  change.
I'm  not  married.
Crazy, i  know  insane  
But  i  was  not  limited  when  i  sang. And  as  air  came  up  from  my  lungs  through  my  vocal  cords  and  passed  my  lips  as  sound. It  was  the  closest  thing  i  had  ever  come  to  transcendence.
My  father  and  my  grandfather  were  always  looking  for  the  newest  thing  in  alternative  or  traditional  therapies  for  ph. But  after  six  months, i  Couldn't  walk  up  a  small  hill. I   Couldn't  climb  a  flight  of  stairs.
Mine  was  146  
Doctors, insert  a  Catheter  into  your  chest, which  is  attached  to  a  pump  that  weighs  about  four-and-a-half  pounds.
Literally  hundreds  of  elevator  rides  were  spent  with  me  alone  stuffing  the  pump  into  my  Spanx, hoping  the  doors  Wouldn't  open  unexpectedly, 
Against  my  Doctors'  and  Family's  wishes, i  needed  to  go  back  for  the  funeral.
I  was  dying. And  if  i  Didn't  mix  that  stuff  up  fast, i  would  never  leave  that  apartment  alive.
I  went  back  to  the  states, anticipating  I'd  return  to  europe, but  the  heart  Catheterization  showed  that  i  Wasn't  going  anywhere  further  that  a  Flight-for-life  from  johns  hopkins  hospital  
A  happy  patient  is  a  healthy  patient  
And  it  was  Right-heart  failure.
It  was  a  match  
Because  despite  their  problems, i  had  spent  my  whole  life  training  my  lungs, and  i  was  not  particularly  enthusiastic  about  giving  them  up.
They  left  my  chest  open  for  two  weeks, 
An  infection  ravaged, my  skin  
If  they  stayed  in  there  was  no  way  i  would  ever  sing  again.
There  were  a  dozen  tubes  coming  in  and  out  of  my  body  
I  Couldn't  walk, i  Couldn't  talk. I   Couldn't  eat. I   Couldn't  move. I   certainly  Couldn't  sing. I   Couldn't  even  breathe. But  when  i  looked  up  and  i  saw  my  mother, i  Couldn't  help.
Whether  by  a  Mack  truck  or  by  heart  failure  or  faulty  lungs, death  happens  
But  life  Isn't  really  just  about  avoiding  death.
Life  magazine  helped  in  this  effort, by  announcing  the  introduction  of  Throwaways  that  would  liberate  the  Housewife  from  the  Drudgery  of  doing  dishes.
A  teacher  told  me  how  to  express  the  Under-five-percent  of  plastics  recovered  in  our  waste  stream.
In  spite  of  deposit  fees, much  of  this  trash  leading  out  to  the  sea  will  be  plastic  Beverage  bottles,

We  wanted  to  see  if  the  most  common  fish  in  the  deep  ocean  at  the  base  of  the  food  chain  was  Ingesting  these  poison.
But  no  Fishmonger  on  earth  can  sell  you  a  certified  organic  Wild-caught, fish, 
The  range  of  the  species  goes  up  to  as  much  as  380  feet  tall.
I  became  very  interested, and  i  wrote  about  a  couple  
His  friend, a  guy  named  Marwood  harris  was  following  behind  
But  they  made  it  to  the  top, and  what  they  found  was  not  a  redwood  desert, but  a  lost  world  --  a  kind  of  three-dimensional  labyrinth  in  the  air  filled  with  unknown  life.
Children  are  incredibly  adept  at  climbing  trees.
That's, my  son  oliver, 
If  ontogeny  recapitulates  phylogeny, then  children  are  somewhat  closer  to  our  roots  as  primates  in  the  Arboreal  forest  
You  ascend  30.
And  There's  also  something  that  i  want  to  show  you  
The  scientists  are  doing  all  kinds  of  experiments  in  these  trees.
We're  looking  at  the  very  top  of  gaya, which  is  thought  to  be  the  oldest  redwood  
What  can  the  redwoods  tell  us  about  ourselves  
The  flickering  Transitory  quality  of  human  time  and  the  brevity  of  human  life  --  the  necessity  to  love  
And  i  think  that  one  of  the  happiest  things  is  the  sense  that  with  my  children  I've  been  able  to  introduce  them  into  the  very  small  circle  of  humans, who  are  lucky  enough  or  possibly  stupid  enough  to  still  climb  trees.
But  That's, just  a  very  small  facet  of  a  much  greater  problem  of  invasions  of  species  worldwide  all  through  the  ecosystems.
Thank  you

And  basit  and  amjad  are  first  names.
So  half  a  year  ago, i  decided  to  go  to  pakistan  myself, 
And  i  knocked  on  the  door, 
You  want  to  guess  who  opened  the  door  
So  let  me  just  run  some  viruses  on  my  computer  
Let  me  show  you  one, which  actually  makes  some  sound  
We  find  guys  like  Bjorn  Sundin, originally  from  sweden  and  his  partner  in  crime  also  listed  on  the  Interpol  wanted  pages, mr  Shaileshkumar  Jain, a  us  citizen, ,
Now, criminals, who  Weren't  capable  of  reaching  us  before  can  reach  us.
But  even  more  interestingly, if  we  continue  Decrypting  We'll  find  this  mysterious  string, which  says, O600ko78rus  ,
It's  not  used  for  anything  
I  got  zero  hits  Wasn't, there  
So  i  spoke  with  the  guys  at  the  lab  
And  on  this  blog, he  blogs  about  his  life  about  his  life  in  st  petersburg  --  He's  in  his  early  20s  --  about  his  cat  about  his  girlfriend.
In  fact, this  guy  drives  a  Mercedes-benz  S600  V12  with  a  Six-liter  engine  with  more  than  400  horsepower  
The  vast  majority  of  the  online  crime  cases, we  Don't  even  know  which  continent, the  attacks  are  coming  from  .
Plc's  these  small  boxes  which  have  no  display, no  keyboard, which  are  programmed  are  put  in  place, and  they  do  their  job  
You  go  to  any  factory, any  power  plant  any  chemical  plant, any  food  processing  plant  you  look  around  --  everything  is  being  run  by  computers.
I'm  worried  that  we  are  running  into  problems  because  of  online  crime  
I'm, not  engaged  in  predicting  random  number  generators: 
I  Don't  have  a  clue.
Mother  Theresa, she  was  rational  
So  we  have  to  work  out  who  influences  problems  
There  are  lots  of  people  shaping  decisions. And  so  if  we  want  to  predict  correctly, we  have  to  pay  attention  to  everybody  who  is  trying  to  shape  the  outcome.
So  with  just  that  little  bit  of  input, we  can  work  out  what  the  choices  are  that  people  have  what  the  chances  are  that  They're  willing  to  take  what  They're  after  what  they  value, what  they  want.
I  remind  you  of  that  90  percent  accuracy  rate

Everything  is  not  predictable. The  stock  market  is  at  least  for  me, not  predictable. But  most  complicated  negotiations  are  predictable.
And  if  you  engineer  what  they  do, you  can  change  the  world. You  can  get  a  better  result.
So  I've  had  an  obsession, basically  for  30  years, and  that  obsession  has  been  what  makes  the  difference  in  the  quality  of  peoples  lives.
Whether  it  be  your  business, your  contribution  to  society  money  --  whatever  it  is  for  you  --  your  body, your  family, 
But  the  other  lesson  of  life  that  is  rarely  mastered  is  the  art  of  fulfillment  
Because  science  is  easy  right?
And  everybody  in  this  room  --  you  Wouldn't  be  in  this  room. If  you  bought  that  theory  --  but  the  --  most  of  society  thinks  biography  is  destiny.

If  you  Don't  have  the  money, but  You're  creative  and  determined  enough, you  find  the  way.
In  this  second  consciously, or  unconsciously  the  minute, you  decide  to  focus  on  something  You've  got  to  give  it  a  meaning  and  whatever  that  meaning  is  produces  emotion.
Honestly  better  or  worse, say, aye  
How  would  their  lives  be  different?
Audience: aye!
Let  me  tell  you  what  they  are.
So  That's, why  violence  has  always  been  around  and  will  be  around  unless  we  have  a  consciousness  change  as  a  species, 
I  said, focus  on  'there's  Food'  --  what  a  concept, you  know, 
Second  --  but  this  is  what  changed  my  life.

Mau  is  a  Palu, a  navigator  priest, 
Their  tradition  is  so  extraordinary  that  these  mariners  sailed  three  million  square  miles  across  the  pacific, without  the  use  of  instruments, 
The  Palu  also  had  an  uncanny  ability  to  forecast  weather  conditions  days  in  advance, 
Their  achievements  intellectually  and  scientifically  are  extraordinary  and  they  are  so  relevant  for  these  times  that  we  are  in  when  we  are  riding  out  storms.
We  Cannot  afford  to  lose  it.
The  link  between  the  past  and  the  future  is  fragile  
I  am  haunted  by  the  fact  that  i  no  longer  remember  the  names  of  the  winds  and  the  rains  
And  i  am  reminded  that  throughout  the  world, there  are  cultures  with  vast  sums  of  knowledge  in  them  as  potent  as  the  Micronesian  navigators  that  are  going  dismissed  that  this  is  a  testament  to  brilliant  brilliant  technology  and  science  and  wisdom  that  is  vanishing  rapidly  
Youtube  cares  deeply  about  the  rights  of  content  owners.
Because  sony  music  had  registered, chris  Brown's  video  in  our  content  id  system  within  seconds  of  attempting  to  upload  the  video, the  copy  was  detected, giving  sony  the  choice  of  what  to  do  next  
The  Video's  inspired  over  26000  dollars  in  donations  to  end, domestic  violence, 
So, why  has  no  one  ever  solved  this  problem  before

Since  the  dawn  of  human  history, We've  tried  to  rectify  this  imbalance  by  making  art  writing  poems, singing  songs, Scripting  Editorials  and  sending  them  in  to  a  newspaper, gossiping  with  friends.
It's  been  running  for  about  a  year  and  a  half  
And  I'll  show  you  a  glimpse  of  how  this  information  is  then  visualized.
The  dots  exhibit  human  qualities, they  kind  of  have  their  own  physics, and  they  swarm  wildly  around, kind  of  exploring  the  world  of  life

This  is  in  response  to  What's, beautiful, miss  world, 
And  it  caused  me  to  wonder  about  our  world  today.
And  those  are  the  questions  that  inspired  my  new  project, which  is  Debuting  here  today  at  ted  
It's  called  universe, revealing  our  modern  mythology, 
This  is  the  universe  of  2007, the  last  two  months  
But  we  can  actually  be  more  specific  in  defining  our  universe.
So  we  see  obama  and  the  Clintons  meet  in  alabama  
You  can  see  that  this  is  an  important  story. There  are  a  lot  of  things  in  its  orbit. If  we  open  this  up, we  get  different  perspectives  on  this  story.
And  You'll  all  be  able  to  use  it  and  kind  of  explore  what  your  own  personal  mythology  might  be  
As  you  search  for  the  things  that  are  important  to  you  in  your  world  and  then  see  what  the  constellations  of  those  might  look  like  
We're  facing  this  problem.
There  is  the  problem  
And  you  know, going  back  maybe  10  years  in  time, when  i  got  the  funding  to  buy  my  first  graphics  computer  --  it  was  a  huge  machine.
It  was  cabinets  of  processors  and  storage  and  everything  
This  is  a  data  set  that  was  captured  using  a  ct  scanner.
And  of  course, all  the  data  is  inside, so  i  can  start  rotating.
And  one  of  the  applications  that  We've  been  working  on  --  and  this  has  gotten  a  little  bit  of  traction  worldwide  --  is  the  application  of  virtual  autopsies  
So  this  is  from  a  virtual  autopsy  
The  person  was  killed  by  Stabs  in  the  heart, but  they  just  deposited  the  knife  by  putting  it  through  one  of  the  eyeballs.
Here's, another  case  that  i  think  is  interesting  
During  a  physical  autopsy, if  you  actually  have  to  dig  through  the  body  to  find  these  fragments  That's, actually  quite  hard  to  do  
So  if  you  have  the  opportunity, please  try  it  out.
It's  really  a  hands-on  experience.
And  this  is  a  bit  of  science  fiction  now, so  We're  moving  into  really  the  future.
And  He's  also  hearing  our  instructions  when  we  tell  him  to  do  things  
And  in  just  a  second  here, you  will  see  --  okay, here  motts  now  move  your  left  foot  
I  can  look  inside  of  it.
And  here  it  is  here  is  the  nose  of  the  bear  
Well, 80  percent  of  the  men  in  lesotho  worked  in  the  mines  over  the  border  in  brutal  conditions.

Perhaps  the  universe  existed  before  the  bang, and  the  bang  was  just  a  violent  event  in  a  Pre-existing  universe.
I  Won't  go  into  the  details  of  why  we  think  the  universe  is  like  this, but  it  comes  out  of  the  math  and  trying  to  explain  the  physics  that  we  know  
And  There've  been  bangs  in  the  past, and  there  will  be  bangs  in  the  future.
What  about  africa  
It's  still  going  on  
What  about  Africa's  capacity  to  do  something  about  these  problems?
Well, Here's, the  number  of  physicians  in  africa, 
And  while  i  was  busy  working  --  i  was  working  on  these  colliding  worlds  in  the  day, 
And  we  got  lots  of  Applicants  
You  have  to  rethink  what  is  the  university  for  
No  Droning  on  at  the  chalkboard  
Everyone  lives  together  in  this  hotel  --  lecturers  and  students  --  and  It's, not  surprising  at  all  to  find  an  Impromptu  Tutorial  at  1, am  
We  especially  emphasize  areas  of  great  relevance  to  Africa's  development, because  in  those  areas  scientists  working  in  africa  will  have  a  competitive  advantage.
They'll  publish  be  invited  to  conferences  
And  aims  has  done  extremely  well  
Five; students  can  be  educated  at  aims  for  the  cost  of  educating  one  in  the  us  or  europe, 
She  communicates  well  with  the  Immunologists  at  the  hospital  
Here  are  the  current  students  at  aims?
So  now, I'm  going  to  get  to  my  ted  business  
I  want  to  point  out  a  few  other  exceptional  people  in  this  picture, 
And  She's  now, at  aims  
And  our  wish  has  two  parts. One  is  a  dream  and  the  Other's  a  plan.
Our  ted  dream  is  that  the  next  einstein  will  be  african  
We  want  to  add  entrepreneurship  and  policy  skills, 
Over  the  last  year  We've  been  visiting  sites  in  africa, looking  at  potential  sites  for  new  aims  centers.
So  we  have  political  support  right  across  the  continent  
But  nobody  was  really  worried  about  this  
This  is  a  quote, actually  from  alan  turing  in  30  years.
This  was  in  1946, and  now  in  2007  It's  still  not  true  
That's, how  much  power  this  computer  uses  
Rory  is  a  graduate  student  at  stanford.
I  estimate  10  to  the  16  bits  per  second, which  is  actually  about  very  similar  to  what  blue  gene  does  
And  let  me  just  summarize.
So  this  clip  is  from  the  pbs  series, the  secret  life  of  the  brain  
And  That's  basically  What's  going  on  in  your  brain  right  now  as  You're  watching  this  
The  devices  that  computers  use  are  What's  called  a  transistor  
Your  computer  uses  this  presence  of  current  to  represent  a  one  and  the  absence  of  current  to  represent  a  zero  
But  when  It's  open  because  these  ions  have  to  line  up  and  flow  through  one  at  a  time, you  get  a  kind  of, sporadic, not  steady  --  It's, a  sporadic  flow  of  current  
In  fact, There's  about  12.
What  you  see  here  is  that  There's, these  redundant  connections  
This  is  Kareem's, dark  eyes  and  That's  the  white  background  that  you  see  here  
So  we  are  really  Duplicating  the  kind  of  signals  that  you  have  on  the  optic  nerve  
Let  me  just  end  by  saying  that  this  is  what  happens  when  you  put  africa  in  a  piano.
And  i  had  this  gut  reaction  that  this  was  the  wrong  way  to  do  it  
I'm  interested  in  finding, whether  or  not  there  is  a  really  massive, what  we  like  to  call  supermassive  black  hole  at  the  center  of  our  galaxy  
But  today, the  way  i  want  you  to  understand  a  black  hole  for  the  proof  of  a  black  hole  is  to  think  of  it  as  an  object  whose  mass  is  confined  to  zero  volume  
So, why  is  it  so  important  
Now, the  key  here  is  to  figure  out  what  that  schwarzschild  radius  is  
It  depends  only  on  the  mass  of  the  object  
There  are  big  ones. There  are  little  ones.
And  there  are  a  hundred  billion  stars  in  that  galaxy. Just  to  give  you  a  sense  of  scale.
So  at  the  center  there  That's, actually  where  most  of  the  starlight  comes  out  from  
So  you  Can't  see  the  black  hole  itself, but  you  can  convert  the  gravitational  energy  of  the  black  hole  into  the  light.
And  if  there  is  a  supermassive  black  hole, what  we  need  to  assume  is  that  It's  a  black  hole  on  a  diet  
And  we  live  in  the  middle  of  it.
It's  the  gravitational  pull  that  makes  these  things  orbit.
So  this  is  great, because  remember, my  job  is  to  show, there  is  a  lot  of  mass  inside  a  small  volume  
So  i  want  to  see  the  stars  that  are  as  close  to  the  center  of  the  galaxy  as  possible  
Because  i  want  to  show  there  is  a  mass  inside  as  small  a  region  as  possible  
And  that  buys  us  about  a  factor  of  20  
So  without  this  technology, you  Can't  see  the  stars  
And  this  one, this  one  goes  around  in  a  human  lifetime, ,
And  the  truth  is  I'm, not  quite  there.
But  we  actually  have  no  alternative  today  to  explaining  this  concentration  of  mass  
Likewise, for  the  young  stars, or  in  contrast, the  young  stars, they  just  should  not  be  there.
Using  observations  that  are  not  the  ones  I've  shown  you  today.
The  old  ones  are  red

And  whether  we  call  them  440  per  second, a  or  3729  b, flat  --  trust  me, That's, right  --  They're  just  phenomena.
And  in  the  17th  century, it  was  more  like  this  
And  there  began  to  be  a  real  difference  at  this  point  between  the  art  of  improvisation  and  the  art  of  composition  
So  in  the  first  eight  centuries, or  so  of  this  tradition, the  big  'what'  was  to  praise  god, ,
The  'how'  was  a  style  called  Polyphony  music  of  many  independently, moving  voices.
Ah, Avaricious, heaven, 
And  the  chords, it  turned  out  were  capable  of  representing  incredible  varieties  of  emotions.
It's, just  these  two  notes  in  the  middle  ,
And  it  turned  out  the  symphony  could  be  used  for  more  complex  issues  like  gripping  ones  of  culture, such  as  nationalism  or  quest  for  freedom  or  the  frontiers  of  sensuality.
What  happens  when  the  music  stops  
Where  does  it  go?
It's  the  passing  on  part  It's, the  'why'  part  of  it  
At  the  same  time  technology  by  taking  over  the  role  that  notation  had  always  played  shifted  the  balance  within  music  between  instinct  and  intelligence  way  over  to  the  instinctive  side.
What's  the  long-term  effect  of  this  on  us  or  on  music  
Nobody  knows  
There's  just  a  role  here  for  so  many  people  --  teachers, parents, performers  --  to  be  explorers  together,

Then  these  two  fellows  came  along  and  they  were  flying  kites  to  develop  the  control  systems  that  would  ultimately  enable  powered  human  flight  
But  unfortunately, it  relegated  kites  once  again  to  be  considered  Children's  toys, 
And  it  Doesn't  hurt  to  do  it  in  a  location  like  this  either  
If  You'd  loan  me  your  Gulfstream, I'll, rip  its  wings  off  and  generate  you  a  Megawatt  
The  story  starts  with  just  a  single  person, a  child  behaving  a  little  strangely  
They're  creating  the  ecosystem  from  which  innovation  emerges  
It's  based  on  hundreds  of  hours  of  research  of  practice  
Now, Here's  an  example  --  Pre-internet  --  of  this  machine  in  action, 
I  mean, you  might  just  be  a  kid  with  a  webcam, but  if  you  can  do  something  that  goes  viral, you  get  to  be  seen  by  the  equivalent  of  sports  stadiums  crammed  with  people  
And  even  if  It's  not  that  eloquent  --  and  It's, not  --  it  can  still  really  make  your  day.
In  fact, my  colleague, june  cohen  has  taken  to  calling  it  radical  openness  because  it  works  for  us. Each  time.
By  giving  away  our  tedx  brand, we  suddenly  have  a  Thousand-plus  live  experiments  in  the  art  of  spreading  ideas.
We're, a  social  species, 
And  That's  why  what  I'm  excited  about. And  what  i  think  is  Under-reported  is  the  significance  of  the  rise  of  online  video.
He's, a  Unicyclist  
Jove  is  a  website  that  was  founded  to  encourage  scientists  to  publish  their  peer-reviewed  research  on  video.
Why  do  people  like  watching  tedtalks?
500  years  ago, it  ran  into  a  competitor  with  a  lethal  advantage  
I  mean, today, one  person  speaking  can  be  seen  by  millions  shedding, bright  light  on  potent  ideas, creating  intense  desire  for  learning  and  to  respond  --  and  in  his  case, intense  desire  to  laugh, 
Thousands  of  people  are  figuring  out  new  ways  to  learn  and  crucially  to  respond  completing  the  cycle.
And  so, as  We've  thought  about  this, you  know, It's  become  clear  to  us  what  the  next  stage  of  Ted's  evolution  has  to  be  
They  used  the  same  trash  to  form  green  manure  
Thank  you  
The  name  abegg  --  abegg  is  actually  A-b-e-g-g  and  That's.
What  i  do  first  is, i  make  a  lot  of  little  musical  ideas  --  you  can  just  improvise  here  at  the  piano  --  and  i  choose  one  of  those  to  become  my  main  theme, my  main  melody  like  the  abegg  that  you  just  heard  
So  for  inspiration, i  listened  to  Liszt  and  Tchaikovsky  and  all  the  great  romantic  composers, 
And  once  i  realized  it  There's  a  parallel  between  creating  music  and  creating  art, because  for  your  motive  or  your  little  initial  idea  for  your  drawing, It's  your  character  --  you  want  to  decide  who  do  you  want  to  draw, or  if  you  want  to  draw  an  original  character, 
Like  am  i  going  to  use  one  page  
Am  i  going  to  use  a  Two-page  spread  like  a  comic  book  for  more  Grandiose  effect.
Instead  I'd  like  to  try  something  called  improvisation  
And  That's  a  huge  amount  of  data  
And  the  more  technical  topics, such  as  architecture  materials  and  strangely  enough  men, those  are  not  good  topics  to  talk  about  .
Ingenious  tedtalks: much  more  this  green  color, etc, et  
Now  since  this  is  Tedactive, and  i  learned  from  my  analysis  that  i  should  actually  give  you  something, i  will  not  impose  the  ultimate  or  worst  tedtalk  on  you, but  rather  give  you  a  tool  to  create  your  own  
And  i  call  this  tool, the  Tedpad  
Thank  you  very  much  
Now, if  you  combine  this  very  simple, very  conservative  thought  --  go  with  the  grain  of  human  nature  --  with  all  the  advances  in  behavioral  economics, some  of  which  we  were  just  hearing  about  again. I   think  we  can  achieve  a  real  increase  in  well-being  in  happiness  in  a  stronger  society  without  necessarily  having  to  spend  a  whole  lot  more  money.
Well, i  Can't  in  the  time, I've  got  give  huge  numbers  of  examples.
And  this  is  so  obvious  in  a  way, because  you  think  about  how  all  of  you  have  changed  the  way  we  shop  the  way, we  travel  the  way  that  business  is  done  
We  want  to  get  people  to  be  more  energy, efficient, 
Obviously  here  we  have  jfk  with  that  incredibly  simple  and  powerful  Formulation, ask  not  what  your  country  can  do  for  you  ask  what  you  can  do  for  your  country, an  incredibly  noble  sentiment, 
But  when  he  made  that  speech, what  could  you  do  to  build  the  stronger  better  society?
And  i  think  an  even  more  wonderful  speech, which  I'm  going  to  read  a  big  chunk  of  which  sums  up  what  i  said  at  the  beginning  about  believing  there  is  more  to  life  than  money  and  more  that  we  should  try  and  measure  than  money.
Some  say, up  to  five  tons  
They're, fantastic  creatures  
So  they  were  incredibly  important  animals, 
The  importance  of  basking  sharks  to  the  coast  communities  is  recognized  through  the  language.
And  most  of  what  we  do  know  is  based  on  their  habit  of  coming  to  the  surface, 
And  we  try  to  guess  what  They're  doing  from  their  behavior  on  the  surface.
And  we  tagged  them  very  simply  not  very  Hi-tech  with  a  big  long  pole  
And  of  course, sharks  fish  are  underwater.
And  Here's  a  couple  of  maps  that  We've  done  
That  one  you  can  see  that  we  tagged  both  off  kerry  
So  he  did  another  study  using  Microsatellites, which  are  much  more  expensive  much  more  time  consuming  and  to  his  surprise  came  up  with  almost  identical  results.
And  It's  thought, maybe  it  was  a  bottleneck  a  genetic  bottleneck  thought  to  be  12000  years  ago. And  this  has  caused  a  very  low  diversity.
But  the  average  of  all, these  studies  came  out  --  the  mean  is  about  5000, which  i  personally  Don't  believe, but  then  i  am  a  skeptic  
In  fact  of  those  20000  8000  were  thought  to  be  females, 
They  Didn't  get  enough  samples  to  really  explore  the  genetics  in  enough  detail.
And  some  are  caught  in  nets  in  Trawls  
And  in  about  half  an  hour, we  got  five  samples. Five  individual  sharks  were  sampled  using  Simon's  shark  slime  sampling  system.
And  i  was  thinking  of  humpback  whales  Breaching  and  dolphins  
And  what  You're  trying  to  look  at  is  the  males  have  Claspers, which  kind  of  dangle  out  behind  the  back  of  the  shark  
And  you  just  want  to  learn  as  much  as  you  can, as  soon  as  you  can  
Philosophers  Dramatists  Theologians  have  Grappled  with  this  question  for  centuries. What  makes  people  go  wrong?
So  when  i  read  robert  louis  stevenson  that  Wasn't  fiction  
And  apparently  he  disobeyed  god  and  That's  the  ultimate  disobedience  to  authority  
I  became  an  expert  witness  for  one  of  the  guards  sergeant  chip  frederick.
I  had  access  to  him, i  could  study  him.
Why  Tier  1-a  was  the  center  for  military  intelligence, 
That's  one  of  the  visual  illustrations  of  evil  
Who  are  the  bad  apples?
And  so  We're  interested  in  what  are  the  external  factors  around  the  individual  --  the  bad  barrel  
And  social  scientists  stop  there, and  they  miss  the  big  point  that  i  discovered  when  i  became  an  expert  witness  for  abu  ghraib.
This  is  stanley  milgram  little  jewish  kid  from  the  bronx. And  he  asked  the  question: could  the  holocaust  happen  here?
He  gets  tied  up  to  the  shock  apparatus  in  another  room.
And  so  He's, the  modern  lucifer  effect, a  man  of  god, who  becomes  the  angel  of  death  
It  was  a  real  cop  car. It  was  a  real  policeman. And  there  were  real  neighbors  in  the  street  who  Didn't  know  that  this  was  an  experiment.
Do  they  kill  torture, Mutilate, 13, 
If  you  give  people  power  without  oversight, It's  a  prescription  for  abuse, they  knew  that  and  let  that  happen  
The  answer  is  nobody. And  i  think  nobody  on  purpose.
Banality  of  heroism  is  It's.
He  was  a  low-level  private, and  that  stopped  it  was  he  a  hero, no  
She  came  down  saw  that  Madhouse  and  said, you  know  what  It's  terrible, what  You're  doing  to  those  boys  
So  the  psychology  of  heroism  is  --  We're  going  to  end  in  a  moment  --  how  do  we  encourage  children  in  new  hero  courses  that  I'm  working  with  matt  Langdon  --  he  has  a  hero  workshop  --  to  develop  this  heroic  imagination. This  Self-labeling, i  am  a  hero  in  waiting  and  teach  them  skills.

Take  path  one  You're  going  to  be  a  perpetrator  of  evil.
Path  two, you  become  guilty  of  the  evil  of  passive  inaction, 
We  should, in  fact, because  without  having  this  possibility  of  conscious  minds, we  would  have  no  knowledge  whatsoever  about  our  humanity. We  would  have  no  knowledge  whatsoever  about  the  world.
So  much  for  the  wonder, now, for  the  mystery  
And  in  that  image, there  you  see  a  variety  of  islands  of  what  i  call  image-making  regions  in  the  brain.
You  have  the  green, for  example, that  corresponds  to  tactile  information  or  the  blue  that  corresponds  to  auditory  information.
But  what  about  the  self  
And  for  a  long  time, people  did  not  even  want  to  touch  it  because  They'd  say, how  can  you  have  this  reference  point?
I  like  to  call  it  an  almost  infinite  sameness  from  day  to  day  
There  is  the  brain  stem  in  between  the  cerebral  cortex  and  the  spinal  cord  
It  developed  in  Collectives  of  human  beings, 
Why  care  if  it  is  the  brain  stem  or  the  cerebral  cortex  and  how  this  is  made  
And  if  we  are  interested, for  example, in  the  fact  that  Anti-gravity  is  pulling  galaxies  away  from  the  earth. Why  should  we  not  be  interested  in  what  is  going  on  inside  of  human  beings?
When  i  was  just  a  little  girl, my  mom  started  what  is  now  the  Longest-running  Women's  film  festival  in  the  world, 
Fishnet, Stockings, 
I  thought  they  were  really  hot  
There  are  lots  of  very  modern  political  movements  that  have  caught  fire  in  no  small  part  because  of  cultural  Hipness  
And  one  of  our  biggest  successes  is, we  get  mail  from  teenage  girls  in  the  middle  of  iowa  who  say, i  Googled, jessica  simpson  and  stumbled  on  your  site  
We  Don't  want  one  face  
Thank  you  
It's  enough  to  make  you  feel  very  overwhelmed.
Which  brings  me  to  my  third  paradox: 
You  may  have  guessed  by  now  i  did  not  light  myself  on  fire.
Cornel  west  says, of  course, It's  a  failure  
She  was  talking  about  board  meetings. She  was  founding  peace  organizations. She  was  coordinating  Carpools. She  was  Consoling  friends  --  all  these  daily  acts  of  care  and  creativity.
And  surely, at  three  and  four  years  old, i  was  listening  to  the  soothing  sound  of  her  voice.
Know  thyself.
And  we  feel  like  we  have  to  get  far  far  away  to  a  Secluded  retreat, leaving  it  all  behind  
This  is  the  term  that  armies  use  when  They've  lost  a  battle  
You  may  or  may  not  have  noticed  that  I'm  wearing  a  tiny  electrode  on  my  forehead, 
Let  me  show  you  what  it  looks  like  
Or  what  if  i  can  take  that  information  and  put  it  into  an  organic  shape  up  on  the  screen  
I  may  also  be  interested  in  knowing  how  focused  i  am. So  i  can  put  my  level  of  attention  into  the  circuit  board  on  the  other  side.
And  that  was  Responsiveness  
We  then  realized  that  if  technology  could  know  something  about  you  and  use  it  to  help, you  There's  an  even  more  valuable  application  than  that  
In  the  original  zen  bound  game, you  play  it  by  scrolling  your  fingers  over  the  pad  
You  have  graphs  and  charts  that  tell  you  how  your  brain  was  doing  --  not  just  how  much  rope  you  used  or  what  your  high  score  is. But  what  was  going  on  inside  of  your  mind?
The  way  these  children  will  be  able  to  use  their  new  awareness  to  improve  themselves, will  Upend  many  of  the  damaging  and  widespread  social  Stigmas  that  people  who  are  diagnosed  as  different  are  challenged  with  
Thank  you  
So  i  used  to  get  my  eyes  tested  just  for  fun  
So  let  me  just  tell  you  the  great  part  of  all  of  this  
And  so  when  i  heard  that  eye  specialist  tell  me  all  the  things, a  big  fat, no, everybody  Imagines. I   was  devastated  .
The  first  thing  i  thought  about  was  my  mom  who  was  crying  over  beside  me, 
And  that  wind  in  my  face  made  me  believe  that  he  was  mad, and  i  would  drive  
Oh  for  the  love  of  god, 
I  just  was  so  --  how  do  i  tell  him  
And  then  he  said  to  me, what  did  you  want  to  be  when  you  were  little  
I  know  this  run  so  well, by  the  back  of  my  hand, 
I  count  the  steps  and  the  Lampposts  and  all  those  things  that  visually  impaired  people  have  a  tendency  to  have  a  lot  of  meetings  with  
And  you  know, the  extraordinary  part  of  it  is, i  just  simply  had  no  answers  
And  nobody  can  tell  me, no  
Yes, you  can  say, i  Can't  be  an  Archeologist  
I'm  going  to  go  across  india  on  the  back  of  an  elephant  
And  i  never  thought  about  Noes  anymore, or  not  seeing, or  any  of  that  kind  of  nothing  
And  consequently  we  can  see  the  result  all  around  us  
I  hope  It's, not  the  curb  cut  between  the  chuck  e, cheese.
This  is  the  other  side  of  the  building  
And  what  is  the  message  that  is  coming? What  are  the  vocabularies  and  Grammars  that  are  coming  from  this  building?
You  know, this  is  a  building  designed  like  a  dvd  player.
Anyway, this  is  how  you  compose  and  assemble  a  downtown  business  building. And  this  is  what  happened  when  in  Glens  falls  new  york, when  we  tried  to  do  it  again, where  it  was  missing  right.
And  that  starts  to  be  delivered  in  the  form  of  the  railroad  suburb, the  country  villa  along  the  railroad  line, which  allows  people  to  enjoy  the  Amenity  of  the  city, but  to  return  to  the  countryside  every  night  
And  That's  the  great  Non-articulated  agony  of  suburbia.
I  Don't  have  any  eyes  on  the  side  of  my  head.
So  they  take  the  first  one  that  comes  along  often  
We're  going  to  have  to  do  something  else.
So  that, you  know, the  Residences  make  sense  deployed  in  relation  to  the  places  of  business  of  culture  and  of  governance  
The  dead  malls, what  are  we  going  to  do  with  them?
No  amount  or  combination  of  alternative  fuels  is  going  to  allow  us  to  continue  running  what  We're  running  the  way  We're  running  it.
We're  going  to  have  to  do  everything  very  differently.
And  America's  not  prepared  
And  within  that  context, we  can  offer  the  kids  time  --  something  that  seems  in  short  supply  in  their  Over-scheduled  lives.
All  materials  are  available  for  use.
It's  a  great  honor  today  to  share  with  you  the  digital  universe, which  was  created  for  humanity  to  really  see  where  we  are  in  the  universe.
Nasa  supported  this  work  12  years  ago, as  part  of  the  rebuilding  of  the  Hayden  planetarium, so  that  we  would  share  this  with  the  world.
I  captured  this  live  from  my  laptop  in  a  cafe  called  earth  matters  on  the  lower  east  side  of  manhattan  where  i  live, and  it  was  done  as  a  collaborative  project  with  the  Rubin  museum  of  himalayan  art  for  an  exhibit  on  comparative  cosmology  
But  this  our  containment  of  the  visible  universe, 
This  map  can  be  updated, and  we  can  add  in  new  data.
We  have  a  growing  user  base  of  this, and  we  network  domes  
So  You're  seeing  the  edge  of  the  earth  
This  is  nepal  and  tibet.
Thank  you  
So  he  figures  out  a  way  to  download  himself  into  his  environment, actually  into  a  series  of  books  
I  think  that  this  is  the  future  of  interface  It's  the  future  of  music, the  future  of  instruments, 
And  I'll, let  adam  tell  you. So  adam  is  a  phd  student  at  mit, an  expert  in  music  technology  and  medicine  and  adam, and  dan  have  become  close  collaborators.
Adam  Boulanger, yes. So  tod, and  i  entered  into  a  discussion  following  the  tewksbury  work, and  it  was  really  about  how  dan  is  an  expressive  person  and  He's  an  intelligent  and  creative  person  and  It's  in  his  face  It's  in  his  breathing  It's  in  his  eyes. How  come  he  Can't  perform  one  of  his  pieces  of  music, That's  our  responsibility. And  it  Doesn't  make  sense.
But  what  about  expression?
So  Let's  do  it.
So  he  can  go  in  hyperscore. You  start  out  by  making  melodies  and  rhythms.
He  can  place  those  exactly  where  he  wants  
But  instead  of  making  it  very  literal  showing  you  exactly  the  camera, tracing, we  turned  it  into  a  graphic  that  shows  you  the  basic  movement  and  shows  the  way  It's  being  analyzed  
Yeah, 
And  these  women  sing, an  Enchanting  song, a  song, so  Alluring  that  all  sailors  who  hear  it  crash  into  the  rocks  and  die  
I  want  to  hear  that  song, untie  me  
There  is  first  the  present  self  
Well, resisting  temptation  is  hard  as  the  19th  century.
So  the  first  is, when  You've  got  one  of  these  devices, going  such  as  this  contract  to  write  everyday  or  pay  It's, just  a  constant  reminder  that  you  have  no  Self-control  
The  other  problem  with  commitment  devices  is  that  you  can  always  Weasel  your  way  out  of  them.
And  this  is  a  timely  issue.
And  We're  at  a  situation  now, where  for  every  three  baby  boomers, the  mckinsey  global  institute  predicts  that  two  will  not  be  able  to  meet  their  Pre-retirement  needs  while  They're  in  retirement  
He  said  that  we  might  neglect  our  future  selves  because  of  some  failure  of  belief  or  imagination, 
When  you  make  an  investment, what  You're  really  saying  is  i  accept  that  any  one  of  these  100  things  could  happen  to  me  and  determine  my  wealth  
Once  you  find  an  investment  that  You're  happy  with  what  people  do  is, they  click  done.
If  you  save  very  little, the  future  self  is  unhappy  living  on  44  percent  of  the  income  
And  What's  nice  about  it  is  It's, not  something  that  Biasing  people, actually, because  as  one  face  smiles  the  other  face, Frowns  
There  are  programs  you  can  get  to  see  how  people  might  look  if  they  smoke  if  they  get  too  much  exposure  to  the  sun, if  they  gain  weight  and  so  on  
Hal  is  here. So  i  think  we  owe  it  to  him  as  well  as  yourself  to  Disabuse.
I  began  my  life  as  a  markets  professional  and  continued  to  take  an  interest. But  most  of  my  recent  effort  has  been  looking  at  the  value  of  what  comes  to  human  beings  from  nature, and  which  Doesn't  get  priced  by  the  markets.
And  the  answer  is, yeah, it  can  
Biodiversity, the  living  fabric  of  this  planet  is  not  a  gas  
And  if  you  look  at  the  species  level, you  saw  about  fish  
And  at  this  rate  at  which  we  are  losing  fish, it  is  a  human  problem  of  enormous  dimensions.
The  green  represents  the  percentage  
The  reason  this  is  happening  boils  down  in  my  mind  to  one  basic  problem, which  is  our  inability  to  perceive  the  difference  between  public  benefits  and  private  profits, 
We  tend  to  constantly  ignore  public  wealth, simply  because  it  is  in  the  common  wealth, It's  common  goods, 
It  causes  pollutants  being  issued, which  have  an  economic  cost  health  cost.
When  we  measure  gdp  as  a  measure  of  economic  performance  at  the  national  level, we  Don't  include  our  biggest  asset  at  the  country  level.
When  we  measure  corporate  performances, we  Don't  include  our  impacts  on  nature  and  what  our  business  costs  society  
That  has  to  stop  
So  clearly, there  was  a  problem  with  deforestation.
And  i  Couldn't  answer  because  neither  of  these  companies  good, though  they  are  and  professional, though  they  are  do  not  calculate  or  disclose  their  externalities  
That's  an  example, i  think  for  us  to  look  at  and  for  us  to  draw  comfort  from  
If  more  companies  did  this  and  if  more  sectors  engaged  this  as  sectors, you  could  have  analysts  business  analysts. And  you  could  have  people  like  us  and  consumers  and  ngos  actually  look  and  compare  the  social  performance  of  companies.
Has  already  set  up  a  coalition  to  do  this  an  international  coalition  
A  bit  like  inflation, you  Over-issue  currency, you  get  what  you  see.
So  in  selecting  targets  of  450  parts  per  million  and  selecting  two  degrees  at  the  climate  negotiations. What  we  have  done  is  We've  made  an  ethical  choice.
I  decided  when  i  was  asked  to  do  this  that  what  i  really  wanted  to  talk  about  was  my  friend, richard  feynman  
Richard  feynman  was  a  very  complex  man  
He  was  a  man  of  many, many  parts  
It  may  still  exist.
But  it  was  really  brutal  
But  the  amazing  thing  was  --  feynman  had  to  leave  a  little  early  
Sometimes  i  would  win  mostly  he  would  win, but  we  both  enjoyed  them  
And  he  said, leonardo  were  you  closer  to  your  mother  or  to  you  father  when  you  were  a  kid, 
Being  dick, he, of  course, wanted  to  check  this  
There  went  that  theory  down  the  trashcan  of  history  
But  let  me  tell  you  a  little  bit  about  feynman.
He  would  try  to  visualize  it  guided  by  a  small  number  of  simple  principles: 
It  was  so  simple.
You  simply  take  the  proton, and  you  hit  it  really  Sharply  with  an  electron  
So  i  think  I'll  just  finish  up  by  saying, i  actually  Don't  think  feynman  would  have  liked  this  event.
Thank  you  
When  this  trailer  showed  up  at  my  shop  in  berkeley, I'd  actually  never  stepped  foot  in  an  airstream  trailer  or  any  other  trailer  
I  decided  i  had  to  do  some  research  and  really  figure  out  what  had  gone  wrong  somewhere  along  the  history  of  airstream.
There's, no  such  things  as  two  walls  and  a  ceiling  coming  together, where  you  can  change  materials  and  shapes  
That's, the  trailer  pretty  much  finished  
I  thought, finally, oh, yeah, great  big  company, I'm  Gonna  work  with  somebody  with  money  for  tooling  and  molding  
Welcome  to  five  dangerous  things, you  should  let  your  children  do  
We  put  warnings  on  coffee  cups  to  tell  us  that  the  contents  may  be  hot  
So  where  does  this  trend  stop?
And  yeah, They're  going  to  cut  themselves.
So  practicing  throwing  things  has  been  shown  to  stimulate  the  frontal  and  Parietal  lobes, which  have  to  do  with  visual  acuity, 3d  understanding  and  structural  problem  solving. So  it  gives  a  sense  --  it  helps  develop  their  visualization  skills  and  their  predictive  ability.
Number  four  --  deconstruct  appliances, 
And  It's  fun  for  the  whole  family  
Narrator: we  are  all  aware  of  the  risk  of  cancer, but  There's  another  disease  That's  destined  to  affect  even  more  of  us.
This  is  the  field  of  biologic  replacements  where  we  replace  Worn-out  parts  with  new  natural  ones.
And  it  works  not  just  for  my  wife, but  certainly  for  other  patients, 
And  so  That's  not  going  to  be  a  solution, That's  going  to  get  us  global  with  biologic  tissue.
How  are  we  going  to  revolutionize  artificial  joint  replacement?
The  space  age  began  50  years  ago, in  october  and  That’s  exactly  what  sputnik  looked  like  
They  would  bring  them  back  and  mount  them  
So  That’s  for  fun  
You  can  see  how  portable  and  handy  it  was  to  have  your  own  Guttenberg  in  1455  
In  1455, nobody  could  read  
But  why  is  this  so  interesting  Here’s, the  quick  story  
That  is  why  the  printing  press  succeeded. And  that  is  why  martin  luther  nailed  his  90  Theses  to  the  door. Because  he  was  complaining  that  the  catholic  church  had  gone  Amok  in  printing  out, indulgences  and  selling  them  in  every  town  and  village  and  city  in  all  of  western  europe.
Instead  of  showing  an  object  from  the  stage  I’m  going  to  do  something  special  for  the  first  time.
We  are  going  to  show  actually  what  the  library  looks  like, ok, 
And  all  throughout  the  library  are  different  objects, different  spaces, 
And  yet  looking  at  them, you  would  see  a  machine  and  a  molecule  
And  what  does  a  lump  of  coal  have  to  do  with  the  internet?
What  that  means  is  a  200-megabyte  file  looks  like  this.
The  ego  is  not  supposed  to  be  involved  in  graphic  design  
So  then  i  can  add  some  color  in  with  the  background  and  add  a  bit  more  color  in  with  the  words  themselves.
So  I'm  currently  working  on  a  book, which  plays  with  both  senses  of  the  word  as  i  explore  some  of  my  own  ideas  and  Inquiries  in  a  visual  display  of  rather  Peacock-like  Grandeur  
I've  been  sending  out  valentines  on  a  fairly  large  scale  since  2005  
There's  a  longer  story  to  this, but  i  did  get  them  all  done  in  time, and  they  were  extremely  well  received  
I  got  an  almost  100  percent  response  rate.
I  had  this  idea  that  i  wanted  people  to  receive  a  kind  of  mysterious  love  letter  like  a  found  fragment  in  their  mailbox.
And  i  specifically  wrote  four  pages  that  Don't, connect  
I'm  certain  i  can  see  you  Blushing  
So  i  Solicited  friends  to  send  me  their  used  christmas  cards, and  i  made  500  of  these  
What  does  it  say?
So  That's, why  i  do  what  i  do  and  why  i  spend  so  much  time  and  effort  on  it  and  why  i  work  in  the  commercial  public  sphere, as  opposed  to  the  isolated, private  sphere  of  fine  art, because  i  want  as  many  people  as  possible  to  see  my  work. Notice  it  be  drawn  into  it  and  be  able  to  take  something  from  it.
And  i  actually  really  feel  that  It's  worthwhile  to  spend  my  valuable  and  limited  time  on  this  earth  in  this  way, 
And  i  thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  show  it  to  you  
The  main  characteristics  of  such  a  system  is  that  There's  one  sole  contact  point  to  the  ground  
He's  now, keeping  a  constant  distance  to  thomas  
And  of  course, who  Wouldn't  like  to  take  a  ride  on  one  of  these  
And  i  say, what  is  the  light  bulb?
Even  when  You're  standing  in  front  of  a  Megaphone  It's  pretty  much  every  direction, 
I  got  this  waterfall  i  recorded  in  my  back  yard.
You  have  to  be  kind  of  smart, and  though  i  did  not  graduate  from  college  Doesn't  mean, I'm  stupid  because  you  Cannot  be  stupid  and  do  very  much  in  the  world  today.
We're  just  starting  to  really  discover  the  laws  of  nature  and  science  and  physics  
I  have  been  really  lucky  with  this  technology, all  of  a  sudden, as  it  is  ready.
This  unit  that  i  played  goes  from  about  200  hertz  to  above  the  range  of  hearing  
It's  actually  emitting  ultrasound  --  low-level  ultrasound  --  That's  about  100000  vibrations  per  second  
And  the  sound  that  You're  hearing, unlike  a  regular  speaker  on  which  all  the  sound  is  made  on  the  face  is  made  out  in  front  of  it  in  the  air  
Or  you  can  whisper  in  the  ear  of  a  supposed  terrorist, some  biblical  verse  
We  put  it  on  a  turret  with  a  camera  so  that  when  they  shoot  at  you  You're  over  there  and  It's, there  
I  took  it  back  to  the  pentagon  after  it  got  declassified  when  the  patent  issued  and  told  the  people  back  there  about  it  and  they  laughed.
So  I've  been  really  lucky  as  an  inventor  
I've  got  a  coke  can  opening  That's, right  in  your  head, That's, really  cool.
Appreciate  it  very  much  
I  thought, i  would  talk  a  little  bit  about  how  nature  makes  materials  
I've  been  fascinated  by  how  nature  makes  materials  and  There's  a  lot  of  sequence  to  how  they  do  such  an  exquisite  job.
So  That's  the  vision  that  I've  been  thinking  about  
There's  diatoms  made  out  of  Sio2  and  They're  Magnetotactic  bacteria  that  make  small  Single-domain  magnets  used  for  navigation  
And  i  was  really  fortunate  to  have  president  obama  visit  my  lab  this  year  on  his  visit  to  mit, and  i  really  wanted  to  give  him  a  periodic  table.
What  if  he  says  'oh, i  already  have  One'  or  'i've  already, memorized  It', 
Now, if  you  take  all  billion  viruses  and  you  can  put  them  in  one  drop  of  liquid, you  can  force  them  to  interact  with  anything. You  want  on  the  periodic  table.
So  basically  viruses  Can't  replicate  themselves, they  need  a  host.
And  so  through  a  process  of  selection  evolution, we  went  from  being  able  to  have  a  virus  that  made  a  crummy  battery  to  a  virus  that  made  a  good  battery  to  a  virus  that  made  a  Record-breaking, high-powered  battery  That's  all  made  at  room  temperature, basically  at  the  bench  top  
You  can  make  lots  of  Amplifications  to  it  
When  you  shine  light  on  them, you  can  see  them  bubbling.
In  this  case, You're  seeing  oxygen  bubbles, come  out  
The  last  example, are  solar  cells  
And  what  We've  found  is  through  genetic  engineering, we  can  actually  increase  the  efficiencies  of  these  solar  cells  to  record  numbers  for  these  types  of  Dye-sensitized  systems.
I'll  hear  things  like  an  extra  room  in  the  house, the  basement  the  coffee  shop, the  library  
And  then  You'll  hear  things  like  the  train, a  plane  a  car  --  so  the  commute  
Why  is  that  happening?
You  Don't  have  a  Workday  anymore.
It's, like  the  front  door  of  the  office  is  like  a  Cuisinart, and  you  walk  in, and  your  day  is  shredded  to  bits  because  you  have  15  minutes  here  and  30  minutes  there, and  then  something  else  happens  and  You're  pulled  off  your  work  and  You've  got  to  do  something  else.
I  sat  at  my  desk, i  used  my  expensive  computer  
You  might  have  a  quick  idea, but  to  be  in  deep  thought  about  a  problem. And  really  consider  a  problem  carefully: you  need  long  stretches  of  uninterrupted  time.
Now  there  are  different  kinds  of  distractions.
So  sleep  is  about  sleep  phases  or  stages  --  some  people  call  them  different  things.
If  You're  interrupted  and  Woken  up, you  have  to  start  again.
I  Don't  think  anyone  would  say, yes, 
They'll  also  say  --  sometimes  They'll  also  say, well, if  i  Can't  see  the  person, how  do  i  know  They're  working  
Which  is  ridiculous, of  course, but  That's  one  of  the  excuses  that  managers  give  
No  one  cared  about  letting  people  take  a  smoke  break  for  15  minutes, 10  years  ago. So  why  does  everyone  care  about  someone  going  to  facebook  here? And  there  or  twitter  here  and  there  or  youtube  here?
Those  are  the  real  problems  in  the  modern  office  today.
That's  kind  of  bad  
And  meetings  are  just  toxic  terrible  poisonous  things  during  the  day  at  work  
What  if  They're  doing  important  work  
If  there  are  10  people  in  the  meeting  It's, a  10-hour  meeting  It's, not  a  one-hour  meeting  
It's, 10  hours  of  productivity  taken  from  the  rest  of  the  organization  to  have  this  one  one-hour  meeting, which  probably  should  have  been  handled  by  two  or  three  people  talking  for  a  few  minutes.
These  things  Don't  exist  outside  of  the  office.
I  have  about  three  minutes  so  That'll  fit  perfectly  
I  Don't  know, if  people  still  do  that  
So  just  the  afternoon, one, thursday  
This  is  when  people  actually  get  stuff  done  is  when  no  One's  bothering  them  when  no  One's  interrupting  them, 
All  these  discussions  and  decisions  you  thought  you  had  to  make  at  this  one  time  at  9  am  on  monday, just  forget  about  them, and  things  will  be  just  fine  
And  i  specialize  in  human  behavioral  research  and  applying  what  we  learn  to  think  about  the  future  in  different  ways  and  to  design  for  that  future.
And  It'll  take  about  another  two  years  to  connect  the  next  billion  after  that  
So  this  is  interesting  to  us  because  the  conscious  and  subconscious  decision  process  implies  that  the  stuff  that  you  do  take  with  you  and  end  up  using  has  some  kind  of  spiritual  emotional  or  functional  value.
But  if  you  ask  people  what  the  three  most  important  things  that  they  carry  are  --  across  cultures  and  across  gender  and  across  contexts  --  most  people  will  say  keys  money.
And  a  mobile  phone, it  turns  out  is  a  great  recovery  tool  
But  --  and  It's  a  pretty  big, but  --  we  forget  
I  think  quite  a  nice  feature  
And  these  things  Don't  stay  in  the  center  of  gravity.
But  the  difference  between  this, and  that  is  There's, no  central  authority  trying  to  control  this  
And  ok, if  you  break  one  of  these  things  here  you  return  it  to  the  carrier  
They'll  probably  give  you  three  new  ones, right?
It  challenges, the  norms  
This  is  how  It's  shifting  
I'm, just  the  messenger  
And  companies  like  Navigenics  and  dna, direct  and  23andme  that  are  giving  you  your  genetic  profiles  are  giving  some  people  a  sense  of  gosh. Well, what  can  i  do  about  it?
And  so  my  request  is, please  Let's  make  technologies  that  make  people  more  human  and  not  less  
I  made  a  lot  of  mistakes  and  dumb  decisions.
So  Let's  say, for  instance, that  You're  on  your  way  to  your  best  Friend's  wedding  and  You're  trying  to  get  to  the  airport  and  You're  stuck  in  terrible  traffic. And  you  finally  arrive  at  your  gate  and  You've  missed  your  flight.
We  wish  We'd  taken  better  advantage  of  the  education  that  we  did  have  
Odds  are  You're  not  going  to  care  in  five  years.
It  feels  terrible  regret, feels  awful  
And  the  thought  was  make  it  go  away.
We  just  want  it  to  vanish  
Make  it  go  away, make  it  go  away.
In  point  of  fact, no  insurance  covers  acts  of  Idiocy  
And  the  problem  is  that  there  are  certain  things  that  happen  in  life  that  we  desperately  want  to  change, and  we  Cannot  
But  first, i  want  to  say  that  the  intensity  and  persistence  with  which  we  experience  these  emotional  components  of  regret  is  obviously  going  to  vary, depending  on  the  specific  thing  that  We're  feeling  Regretful  about  
The  fda  estimates  that  of  all  the  americans  who  have  tattoos  17  percent  of  us  regret, getting  them  
Now, in  my  case, this  really  Wasn't  a  problem  because  It's  actually  very  easy  to  laugh  at  yourself  when  You're  29  years  old, and  you  want  your  mommy  because  you  Don't  like  your  new  tattoo, 
All  right  
And  what  i  loved  about  this  image  of  the  compass  was  that  i  felt  like  it  encapsulated  both  of  these  ideas  in  one  simple  image: 
Even  in  wealthy  countries, it  is  common  now  to  see  inequality  growing  ,
In  the  united  states, since  2001  We've  had  five  years  of  economic  growth, five  years  of  productivity  growth  in  the  workplace. But  median  wages  are  stagnant. And  the  percentage  of  working  families  dropping  below  the  poverty  line  is  up  by  four  percent.
It  is  also  unstable  
Because  primarily  of  the  power  of  the  internet, people  of  modest  means  can  band  together  and  Amass  vast  sums  of  money  that  can  change  the  world  for  some  public  good.
You  saw  one  reference  to  that  in  what  we  were  able  to  do  with  aids  drugs, 
When  i  got  out  of  office  and  was  asked  to  work  first  in  the  caribbean  to  try  to  help  deal  with  the  aids  crisis, generic  drugs  were  available  for  about  500  dollars.
We  need  a  movie  on  those  six  categories.
And  all  of  you  need  to  have  it  embedded  in  your  brains  and  to  organize  yourselves  around  it  
You  think  about  whatever  your  life  has  been, however, many  obstacles  you  have  faced  in  your  life  at  critical  Junctures. You  always  knew  there  was  a  predictable  connection  between  the  effort  you  Exerted.
As  poor  as  haiti  is  in  the  area  where  Farmer's  clinic  is  active  --  and  they  serve  a  Catchment  area  far  greater  than  the  medical  professionals.
We're  essentially  implementing. What  paul  farmer  did  in  haiti. He  develops  and  trains, paid  community  health  workers  who  are  able  to  identify  health  problems, ensure  that  people  who  have  aids  or  tb  are  properly  diagnosed  and  take  their  medicine  regularly  who  work  on  bringing  about  health, education, clean  water  and  sanitation, providing  nutritional  supplements  and  moving  people  up  the  chain  of  health  care.
The  procedures  that  make  this  work  have  been  perfected, as  i  said, by  paul  farmer  and  his  team  in  their  work  in  rural  haiti  over  the  last  20  years, 
And  the  results  were  so  good  that  the  rwandan  government  has  now  agreed  to  adopt  the  model  for  the  entire  country  and  has  strongly  supported  and  put  the  full  resources  of  the  government  behind  it.
And  then  we  have  others  working  in  these  other  related  programs.
So  she  now  works  full-time  on  this  for  very  little, pay  
And  not  a  single  soul  in  this  area  was  being  treated  for  aids  or  tuberculosis, 
Listen  to  this  less  than  Four-tenths  of  one  percent  of  those  being  treated  stopped  taking  their  medicine  or  otherwise  Defaulted  on  treatment  
We're  now, working  with  partners  in  health  and  the  ministry  of  health  in  rwanda  and  our  foundation, folks  to  scale.
We  need  initial  upfront  investment  to  train.
I  had  a  really  hard  time  in  school  
In  fact, my  mother  told  me, eventually  that  i  was  the  little  kid  in  the  village  who  cried  all  the  way  to  school  
I  ran  away  
And  when  the  natural  breeze  Isn't  enough, the  kids  deploy  bubbles, but  not  the  kind  of  bubbles, you  know, 
They  know  they  can  control  their  world.
Landscaping  
They're  part  of  the  rice  cycle, and  these  skills  will  be  valuable  for  them  in  their  future.
The  food  is  incredible  
Green  school  is  a  place  of  pioneers  local  and  global  
The  kids  are  from  25  countries.
You  practice  ancient  balinese  arts  
The  kids  love, it  
And  together  these  volunteers  and  the  teachers  are  deeply  committed  to  creating  a  new  generation  of  global  green  leaders  
The  green  school  effect  --  we  Don't  know  what  it  is.
And  how  did  we  do  all  this  
It's  a  double  helix  
From  the  time  the  foundations  were  finished  in  three  months.
You  ruined  my  life, but  you  gave  me  an  incredible  future.
And  then  a  third  attempt, which  also  Patched  me  back  together, pretty  well  until  it  failed  
I  tried  out  various  computer  voices  that  were  available  online.
There  are  all  sorts  of  html  codes.
But  what  value  do  we  place  on  the  sound  of  our  own  voice  
But  it  Wasn't  that  simple  
Or  roger  20, 
This  is  the  first  version  of  my  computer.
When  i  read  something  it  will  read  in  my  voice.
The  voice  was  created  by  a  company  in  scotland  named  Cereproc  
I  plan  to  use  it  on  television  radio  and  the  internet  
People  who  need  a  voice  should  know  that  most  computers  already  come  with  built-in  speaking  systems, 
John  hunter, all  my  life, i  was  a  Motormouth  
I  doubt  on  that  day, 50  years  ago, they  even  dreamed  of  what  salman  khan  has  accomplished  
But  That's, not  the  point  
I  have  learned  from  wikipedia  that  starting  with  that  humble  beginning, plato, established  forums  message  boards, online, testing  email, chat  rooms, picture  languages, instant  messaging, remote  screen, sharing  and  Multiple-player  games.
But  online  everybody  speaks  at  the  same  speed  
Ironic  that  my  legs  are  fine  and  It's, my  shoulders  that  slow  up  my  walk  
When  you  see  me  today, i  look  like  the  phantom  of  the  opera  
I’d  like  to  dedicate  this  one  to  all  the  women  in  south  africa  --  those  women  who  refused  to  Dwindle  in  the  midst  of  apartheid,

Let  me  tell  you  my  story  
I  came  to  london  and  I've  seen  performance  by  cirque  du  soleil, 
I  wanted  my  artistic  statement: my  interpretation  of  reality, 
The  secret  is  that  we  were  treating  the  whole  newspaper  as  one  piece  as  one  composition  --  like  music, 
And  design  is  responsible  for  this  experience.
What  really  makes  it  amazing  that  the  circulation  of  these  newspapers  were  growing  too  
Same  in  poland, plus  13  up  to  35  percent, raise  of  circulation  after  three  years.
You  can  work  for  a  small  company  in  a  boring  branch  
So  bear  with  me  as  i  take  you  through  this  journey, 
I  was  running  across  the  street. And  the  only  thing  that  i  actually  remember  is  feeling  like  a  grenade  went  off  in  my  head.
And  i  remember  putting  my  hands  on  the  ground  and  feeling  my  Life's  blood  Emptying  out  of  my  neck  and  my  mouth  
I  had  no  idea  what  was  going  on, but  strangers, intervened  kept  my  heart  moving  beating.
I  had  lots  of  titanium  put  in  me, Cadaver  bones  to  try  to  get  my  feet  moving  the  right  way.
And  i  needed  that  wisdom  at  that  moment  in  my  life  
So  they  eventually  started  matching  their  talents  and  skills  to  all  of  my  needs.
So  they  figured  not  being  able  to  see  is  one  thing, but  they  need  to  get  me  to  talk  
The  redundancy  was  actually  good  for  me.
So  everything  is  different  when  You're  a  sighted  person  because  you  take  that  for  granted, 
We  Didn't  have  words  like  Crowd-sourcing  and  radical  collaboration  when  i  had  my  accident.
A  peasant  who  was  walking  to  market  that  morning  ran  towards  where  the  gunshot  had  come  from  and  found  a  young  man  Writhing  in  agony  on  the  floor, clearly  shot  by  a  Dueling  wound.
Galois  was  taken  to  the  local  hospital  where  he  died  the  next  day  in  the  arms  of  his  brother, 
And  the  last  words, he  said  to  his  brother  were  Don't  cry  for  me  alfred  
But  a  few  years  earlier, while  still  at  school  He'd  actually  cracked  one  of  the  big  mathematical  problems  at  the  time, 
Symmetry  can  also  help  us  to  explain  What's  happening  in  the  large  hadron  collider  in  cern.
Artists  too  love  to  play  around  with  symmetry.
Here  is  thomas  mann  talking  about  symmetry  in  the  magic.
And  the  gateway, you  see  behind  has  eight  columns  with  beautiful  symmetrical  designs  on  them.
And  i  said  to  professor  Kurokawa, wow, the  architects  must  have  really  been  kicking  themselves  when  they  realized  that  They'd  made  a  mistake  and  put  this  one  upside  down  
Recently, i  took  my  family  --  we  do  these  rather  kind  of  nerdy  mathematical  trips, which  my  family  love  
I  think  one  of  the  problems  about  school  mathematics  is  it  Doesn't  look  at  how  mathematics  is  embedded  in  the  world.
So  they  explored  a  more  geometric  art  
And  the  power  of  mathematics  is  often  to  change  one  thing  into  another  to  change  geometry  into  language.
Actually  the  invention  of  the  number  zero  was  a  very  modern  concept, seventh  century  ad  by  the  indians.
I  can  reflect  it  in  the  line  through  x  or  the  line  through  y  or  the  line  through  z  
So  both  of  these  objects  have  six  symmetries  
So  the  little  table  here  records  how  the  algebra  of  these  symmetries  work  
And  this  enables  us  to  distinguish  why  the  symmetries  of  these  objects  --  they  both  have  six  symmetries. So  why  Shouldn't?
And  using  those  rules, he  was  able  to  say  that  there  are, in  fact, only  two  objects  with  six  symmetries  
And  all  the  tiles  match  up  again, 
So  there  was  a  sixth  of  a  turn, a  third  of  a  turn  where  the  z  pieces  meet  
How  many  symmetries  does  a  Rubik's  cube  have  
Rather  than  you  all  shouting  out, i  want  you  to  count  how  many  digits  there  are  in  that  number.
Because  this  one, i  think  there  were  a  few  here  
The  people  who  just  last  sat  down  
And  I'd  like  to  review, just  how  unintended  consequences  play, the  part  that  they  do  
But  he  did  his  best, and  he  kept  Meticulous  records  that  let  him  transform  that  branch  of  medicine  
So  there  were  benefits  in  calamities  --  benefits  to  pure  science  as  well  as  to  applied  science  and  medicine  
There  are  two  historians  of  business  at  the  university  of  maryland.
They  have  combined  the  list  of  major  innovations  and  They've  discovered  that  the  greatest  number  the  greatest  decade  for  fundamental  innovations  as  reflected  in  all  of  the  lists  that  others  have  made  --  a  number  of  lists  that  they  have  merged  --  was  the  great  depression, 
So  we  see  that  sometimes  as  a  result  of  these  Dislocations, as  a  result  of  people  leaving  their  original, intended  career  and  going  into  something  else  where  their  creativity  could  make  a  difference  that  Depressions  and  all  kinds  of  other  unfortunate  events  can  have  a  paradoxically  stimulating  effect  on  creativity.
We  need  to  see  what  they  can  do  for  us.
It's  kind  of  like  a  new  approach  to  desktop  computing  
And  some  of  those  we  wanted  to  transfer  to  the  icons  in  our  system.
Also  just  like  paper  around  our  Workspace  We'll, pin  things  up  to  the  wall  to  remember  them  later. And  i  can  do  the  same  thing  here.
So  one  thing  we  have  for  that  is  like  a  grid. Align  kind  of  --  so  you  get  that  more  traditional  desktop  things  are  kind  of  grid  aligned.
The  photo  was  made  when  we  were  deep  in  the  valley  over  there  
But  i  think  the  point  is  that  this  is  metaphor  with  teeth  and  It's  with  those  teeth  that  i  want  to  propose  today  that  we  rethink  a  little  bit  about  the  role  of  contemporary  math  --  not  just  financial  math.
And  he  said, It's, funny, you  ask  that  because  It's  actually  called  black  box  trading  
There's  a  company  in  boston  called  Nanex, and  they  use  math  and  magic, and  i  Don't  know  what  and  they  reach  into  all  the  market  data.
And  when  they  find  them, they  pull  them  out, and  they  pin  them  to  the  wall, like  butterflies, 
Pragmatic  chaos  is, like  all  of  netflix  algorithms  trying  to  do  the  same  thing.
Pragmatic  chaos, like  all  netflix  algorithms  determines  in  the  end, 60  percent  of  what  movies  end  up  being  rented  
Wouldn't  that  be  handy, 
And  it  uses  What's  called  a  Bin-packing  algorithm  
And  this  is  really  where  the  wires  come  right  up  into  the  city.
But  before  i  dive  into  those, i  want  to  admit  that  i  am  an  optimist  
And  part  of  the  reason  i  feel  that  way  is  looking  at  the  past  
Another  statistic, perhaps  my  favorite  is  to  look  at  childhood  deaths  
The  next  breakthrough  is  to  cut  that  10  million  in  half  again, 
Why  well, There's  only  a  few  diseases  that  account  for  the  vast  majority  of  those  deaths, diarrhea, pneumonia  and  malaria  
And  the  disease  was  all  over  the  world.
And  two  tools  helped  bring  the  death  rate  down  
But  malaria  --  even  the  million  deaths  a  year  caused  by  malaria, greatly  Understate  its  impact, 
Over  200  million  people  at  any  one  time  are  suffering  from  it.
And  bed  nets  are  a  great  tool  
So  every  tool  that  We've  ever  had  in  the  past  has  eventually  become  ineffective  
It  involves  communicators  to  keep  the  funding  high  to  keep  the  visibility  high  to  tell  the  success  stories  
It  involves  social  scientists. So  we  know  how  to  get  not  just  70  percent  of  the  people  to  use  the  bed  nets.
It  seems  like  the  kind  of  question  that  people  would  spend  a  lot  of  time  on  and  We'd  understand  very  well  
Let's  start  with  why  this  is  important  
Not  only  has  that  been  weak  It's, getting  weaker  
And  the  answer  is  no  
But  it  in  no  way  is  associated  with  being  a  better  teacher.
They  have  66  schools  --  mostly  middle  schools, some  high  schools  --  and  what  goes  on  is  great  teaching  
If  you  have  a  kid  Who's  behind, you  would  know  you  could  assign  them  that  video  to  watch  and  review  the  concept  
I'm  going  to  send  everyone  here  a  free  copy  of  this  book.
I  only  have  three  minutes  so  I'm  going  to  have  to  talk  fast, and  it  will  use  up  your  spare  mental  cycles.
So  It's  logical  that  You'd  have  one  there  on  the  minor  road  entering  the  major  
And  so  the  question  is, what  does  that  cost  us?
That's  just  the  gasoline  cost, there  is  also  pollution  wear  on  the  car  and  time  
Discount  that  back  to  the  present  at  five  percent  over  two  million  dollars  for  a  stop  sign  in  each  direction, 
Now, if  you  look  at  what  that  adjacent  property  is  worth, you  could  actually  buy  the  property  cut  down  the  Shrubbery  to  improve  the  sight  line, and  then  sell  it  off. Again.
And  because  we  no  longer  need  to  use  sunlight, we  have  very  specialized  lights  that  are  made  for  the  operating  room.
And  this  is  what  i  think  is  the  magic  of  fluorescence  
That's  what  the  surgeon  is  saying, in  the  operating  room  when  the  Patient's  on  the  table, 
But  then  we  actually  Don't  know  that  It's  all  out  
And  we  wait  
So  now, You're  faced  with  telling  your  patient  first  of  all  that  they  may  need  another  surgery, or  that  they  need  additional  therapy  such  as  radiation  or  chemotherapy.
So  even  if  the  tumor  is  not  right  on  the  surface, You'll  still  be  able  to  see  it  
So  if  You're  driving  on  the  freeway, and  you  want  to  know  Where's  the  next  gas  station, you  have  a  map  to  tell  you  that  that  gas  station  is  down  the  road  
So  with  our  technology, we  can  tell  right  away  
Nerves  if  they  are  injured  can  cause  paralysis  can  cause  pain  
But  you  know  what  these  little  nerves  are  so  small  in  the  context  of  prostate  cancer, that  they  are  actually  never  seen  
People  said, We've  been  doing  it  this  way  for  all  these  years  
But  i  went  ahead  anyway, 
We  have  been  able  to  see  nerves  for  facial  expression  for  facial  movement  for  breathing  --  every  single  nerve  --  nerves  for  Urinary  function  around  the  prostate  
I  have  patients  who  would  benefit  from  this  
I  think  that  this  will  result  in  my  surgeries  with  a  better  outcome  and  fewer  complications  
And  this  takes  the  long-term  steady, courage  of  the  Day-in, Day-out  struggle  to  educate  to  persuade  and  to  win  acceptance.
And  that  is  the  light  that  i  want  to  shine  on  health  and  medicine  today, 
They  receive  input  from  thousands  of  upstream  partners  and  compute  their  own  electrical  outputs, which  then  if  they  pass  a  certain  threshold, will  go  to  thousands  of  downstream  partners.
If  we  could  activate  cells, we  could  see  what  powers  they  can  unleash  what  they  can  initiate  and  sustain  .
Now  in  the  20th  century, there  was  some  hope  that  was  generated  through  the  development  of  pharmaceuticals  for  treating  brain  disorders. And  while  many  drugs  have  been  developed  that  can  alleviate  symptoms  of  brain  disorders, practically  none  of  them  can  be  considered  to  be  cured.
There's  one  other  magic  trick  you  need  to  make  this  all  happen  and  That's  the  ability  to  get  light  into  the  brain.
So, how  do  we  do  this  
And  one  of  the  things  that  we  did  was  to  adopt  a  very  classical  model  of  fear  
And  over  time  --  in  this  case, a  mouse, which  is  a  good  animal  model.
The  animal  will  react  by  freezing  sort  of  like  a  deer  in  the  headlights.
Now  i  want  to  close  on  one  story, which  we  think  is  another  possibility  --  which  is  that  maybe  these  molecules  if  you  can  do  Ultra-precise  control  can  be  used  in  the  brain  itself  to  make  a  new  kind  of  prosthetic, an  optical  prosthetic  
Maybe  100000  people  have  cochlear  implants, which  allow  them  to  hear  
And  new  hope  in  gene  therapy  has  been  developed  because  viruses  like  the  Adeno-associated  virus, which  probably  most  of  us  around  this  room  have  and  it  Doesn't  have  any  symptoms, which  have  been  used  in  hundreds  of  patients  to  deliver  genes  into  the  brain  or  the  body  
And  the  retina, of  course, is  a  complex  structure  
We're  going  to  take  these  blue  light  Photosensors  and  install  them  on  a  layer  of  cells  in  the  middle  of  the  retina  in  the  back  of  the  eye  and  convert  them  into  a  camera  --  just  like  installing  solar  cells, all  over  those  neurons  to  make  them  light, sensitive  
So  this  pre-clinical  study, i  think, Bodes  hope  for  the  kinds  of  things  We're  hoping  to  do  in  the  future.
And  by  turning  things  off  It's, more  or  less  a  zero  
Does  that  mean  that  some  day  you  could  download  memories  and  maybe  upload  them  
What  determines  the  types  and  distributions  of  microbes  indoors?
And  we  looked  at  three  different  types  of  rooms, 
Hospitals  use  two  and  a  half  times  the  amount  of  energy  as  office  buildings.
I've  heard  somebody  say  that  You're  as  healthy  as  your  gut, 
And  obviously  I'm  physically  a  very  strong  person, as  you  can  tell  --  --  so  i  Wasn't  worried  about  carrying  this  thing, 20  blocks  
People  were  out  
And  i  thought, well, this  is  the  power  of  a  city  
But  the  system  itself  of  this  city  was  thriving  
Everybody  contributes  a  little  bit  
Well, it  was  the  whole  city  
So  It's  been  a  very  optimistic  time, i  think, and  i  want  to  just  talk  about  a  few  of  those  things.
That  is  --  you  know, There's  no  sentence  that  kind  of  Conjures  up  that  period  better  than  that. I   think  which  is  that  you  suddenly  have  the  power  to  put  up  a  picture  of  your  dog  and  link  to  it. And  somebody  reading  the  page  has  the  power  to  click  on  that  link, or  not  click  on  that  link.
But  It's  still  a  very  one-to-one  kind  of  relationship, 
About  two  months  ago, i  had  the  great  breakthrough  --  one  of  my  great  kind  of  shining  achievements  --  which  is  that  my  website  finally  became  a  top  result  for  steven  johnson  
And  in  fact, i  think  That's  not  entirely  true  anymore.
That  little  list  there  would  change  
That's, not  necessarily  something  we  Didn't  know  already.
I  had  no  idea  
But  What's  interesting  is, you  can  then  broaden  the  search  and  actually  see  interesting  things  and  get  a  sense  of  what  else  is  out  there.
They're  talking  about  slavery  in  1860  
And  ok, i  Didn't  learn  anything  new  there  as  well  --  That's  pretty  obvious, 
I'll  go  very  quickly, 
It's  caused  a  lot  of  controversy, because  people  thought  that  this  was  the  ultimate  kind  of  one  man: one  modem  democracy, where  anybody  can  get  out  there  and  get  their  voice  heard.
And  the  question  was  were  the  birds  singing  
Well  in  my  world, this  is  a  rubber  duck  
That  was  a  nice  thing  to  get  
If  the  end  game  is  global  warming, They're  doing  great  
So  perhaps  we  could  develop  a  strategy  of  change, which  requires  humility, and  in  my  business, as  an  architect, It's  unfortunate  the  word  humility, and  the  word  architect  have  not  appeared  in  the  same  paragraph  since  the  Fountainhead  
There  is  an  infinite  game  and  We're  playing  in  that  infinite  game.
And  so  we  call  it  cradle  to  cradle.
This  is  what  i  presented  to  the  white  house  
So  We've  designed  products, and  we  analyzed  chemicals  down  to  the  parts  per  million  
We  can  ask  ourselves, what  is  justice  and  is  justice  blind, or  is  justice  blindness, 
Is  there  anybody  here  who  Doesn't  breathe  
Here's  dr, Venkataswamy  in  india, Who's  figured  out  how  to  do  mass-produced  health  
They  become  building  steel, 
My  childhood  summers  were  in  the  Puget  sound  of  washington, among  the  first  growth  and  big  growth  
My  grandfather  had  been  a  Lumberjack  in  the  olympics. So  i  have  a  lot  of  tree  karma.
So  all  of  a  sudden  here  i  am  graduating  from  high  school  in  1969, and  this  happens, and  we  realize  that  away  went  away.
Now  if  we  look  at  the  word  competition, I'm  sure  most  of  You've  used  it  
You  know, most  people  Don't  realize  it  comes  from  the  latin  Competere, which  means  strive  together.
It  means  the  way  olympic  athletes  train  with  each  other  
So  We've  been  looking  at  the  idea  of  competition  as  a  way  of  cooperating  in  order  to  get  fit  together.
Now, most  environmentalists, Don't  say, growth  is  good.
Technical  nutrition  will  be  in  an  order  of  magnitude  of  biological  nutrition  
Customers  
Biotechnical  nutrients  --  the  model  U   for  ford  motor, a  cradle  to  cradle  car  --  concept  car, ,
The  idea  here  of  the  car  is  that  some  of  the  materials  go  back  to  the  industry  forever.
We're  doing  12  cities  for  china, right  now, based  on  cradle  to  cradle  as  Templates  
Our  assignment  is  to  develop  protocols  for  the  housing  for  400  million  people  in  12  years.
We  start  to  integrate  commercial  and  mixed  use.
And  then  it  makes  natural  gas, which  then  goes  back  into  the  city  to  power  the  fuel  for  the  cooking  for  the  city.
And  then  the  compost  is  all  taken  back  to  the  roofs  of  the  city  where  We've  got  farming, because  what  We've  done  is  lifted  up  the  city, the  landscape  into  the  air  to  --  to  restore  the  native  landscape  on  the  roofs  of  the  buildings.
They're, probably  less  cell, dense  
And  They're  controlling  basically  everything  that  the  nervous  system  has  to  do  
Because  what  We're  trying  to  measure  the  rna  --  which  is  the  readout  from  our  genes  --  is  very  Labile. And  so  we  have  to  move  very  quickly.
And  then  the  laser  actually  cuts  
Now, this  may  look  like  a  bunch  of  dots  to  you, but  each  one  of  these  individual  dots  is  actually  a  unique  piece  of  the  human  genome  that  we  spotted  down  on  glass.
And  when  we  take  a  sample  and  we  Hybridize  it  to  it, we  get  a  unique  fingerprint.
So  roughly  we  have  50  million  data  points  for  a  given  human  brain.
Green  is  the  sort  of  cool  areas  where  It's  not  turned  on  
Genes, send  the  instructions  to  make  proteins  
So  drugs  bind  to  proteins  and  either  turn  them  off, etc.
It's  as  interesting  a  side  effect, as  it  could  be  
One  other  thing  you  can  do  with  such  a  thing  is  you  can  because  It's  a  pattern  matching  exercise  because  There's  unique  fingerprint, we  can  actually  scan  through  the  entire  genome  and  find  other  proteins  that  show  a  similar  fingerprint.
Now  they  can  come  in, and  they  can  start  to  get  clues  about  activity.
And  then  we  find  some  outliers  some  things  that  lie  beyond  the  cloud  
And  those  genes  are  interesting, but  They're, very  subtle  
These  are  things  where  genes  are  turned  on  in  an  individual  cell  type  
I  think  these  resources  are  incredibly  valuable  
And  there  is  something  else.
And  worst  of  all, we  will  never  know  
And  the  reason  is  that  --  take  africa, for  example, 
Africans  have  already  got  a  lot  of  aid  
We  Don't  know, 
And  a  third  question: education, ,
And  in  this  way, you  can  take  the  guesswork  out  of  policy-making  by  knowing  what  works  what  Doesn't  work  and  why  
It's  going  from  intention  to  action  
We  Cannot  keep  giving  lentils  to  people  
We  can  just  run  an  experiment.
Second  thing  is, how  about  the  use  
Well  in  business  That's, certainly  not  the  way  we  would  go  about  it.
Now, I'm  going  to  show  you  what  we  get  with  various  education  interventions.
So  now  i  started  from  the  big  problem, and  i  Couldn't  answer, it  
In  haiti  about  200000  people  died  --  actually  a  bit  more  by  the  latest  estimate.
So, why  is  that  
With  Deworming, you  can  get  an  extra  year  of  education  for  three  dollars.
So  this  evidence  is  powerful  
It  can  prompt  action, 
These  economics: I'm, proposing  It's  like  20th  century, medicine, 
Fantastic  tales  anecdotes  from  speakers  
And  turnarounds  are  part  and  Parcel  of  what  i  have  focused  on  for  most  of  my  professional  career  
And  she  said, i  want  to  write  a  case  Euvin  --  a  case  on  a  Public-sector  leader  that  has  lessons  for  the  corporate  world.
The  first  thing  that  i  saw  was  north  america  at  night  --  glowing  in  all  its  glory, a  warm  feeling  light  
Entrepreneurs  dynamic  people  people  with  hope.
So  Let's  start  shedding  light  on  this  amazing  Eclectic  continent  that  has  so  much  to  offer  
So  i  want  to  share  with  you  some  of  these  bellwether  signals  or  signs  and  winds  of  change  that  are  sweeping  this  continent  
And  Let's  start  at  the  high  level  on  the  Macro-factors  
Egypt  from  the  16  percent  to  about  84  percent  
But  what  were  they  there  for  to  acquire  assets?
Guarantee  trust  bank  recently, issued  the  first  euro  bond  out  of  africa.
22  to  24  million  barrels  of  oil  a  day  --  the  same  league  as  kuwait  the  same  league  as  venezuela  
So  Let's  Unpack  those  very  quickly  and  I'm  going  to  move  through  these  very, very, very  fast.
What  else  is  going  on  there?
Close  to  the  mediterranean  near  alexandria  --  textiles  petrochemicals, 
So  what  are  the  signs  that  things  are  fundamentally  changing  
What's  going  on  in  some  of  the  other  countries, 
But  in  any  investment  decision, the  key  question  is, what  is  my  alternative?
Now, when  looking  at  africa  vis-a-vis  other  things  and  countries  in  africa  vis-a-vis  other  things  comparisons  become  important  
In  1899, joseph  Conrad  released  the  heart  of  darkness, a  tale  of  grim  horror, along  the  congo  river.
Brain  magic  to  me  indicates  that  area  of  magic  dealing  with  psychological  and  Mind-reading  effects.
So  now  you  can  see  how  easy  it  is  for  me  to  manipulate  the  human  mind.
No, but  You're, ok, yes, 
That  is  weird, 
Thank  you  
Now  I'm  going  to  give  you  some  demonstrations  up  here  live  right  now.
And  Let's  see  down  at  the  end  here. Can  you  also  come  up  real?
Now  It's  very  important  for  everybody  here  to  realize  i  Haven't  set  anything  up  with  you  guys  
You, Don't  know, What's  about  to  happen  is  that  agreed?
Ok, would  you  mind  just  standing  over  here  for  a  moment?
Your  name  is  
Ok, a  little  bit  closer  come  over  --  they  look  really  nervous  up  here.
Voodoo  
Besides  Who's  next  no, ok, 
I  want  you  to  be  aware  of  the  sensations, but  Don't  say  anything  until  i  ask  you  and  Don't  open  your  eyes  until  i  ask, you  
Yes, or  no, did  you  feel  anything  
Yeah, i  walk  around  Nightclubs  all  night  like  this  
And  can  you  take  a  seat  right  over  here  for  me, if  you  Don't  mind  
And  i  want  you  to  hold  it  there  just  for  a  moment, and  i  only  want  you  to  allow  your  hand  to  sink  and  drift  and  float  back  to  the  tabletop  at  the  same  rate  and  speed  as  you  drift  and  float  into  this  relaxed  state  of  awareness  and  allow  it  to  go  all  the  way  down  to  the  tabletop.
Ok, and  only  when  you  feel  the  pressure  go  back, i  want  you  to  allow  your  hand  to  slowly  drift  back  to  the  tabletop.
Allow  it  to  stick  firmly  to  the  tabletop?
Can  you  stand  up  
Imagine  a  connection  between  you  and  him  
Point  directly  at  his  forehead, 
Now  i  want  you  to  be  aware  that  in  a  moment, when  i  snap  my  fingers, your  eyes  will  open.
It's  nearly  impossible  to  break  a  coke  bottle  
You  see  Psychokinesis  is  the  paranormal  influence  of  the  mind  on  physical  events  and  processes  
Be  careful  because  it  is  sharp  just  hold  on  to  it  for  a  moment.
And  i  want  you  to  release  that  negative  energy  by  shaking  it  from  side  to  side  
There's, five  letters  in  the  title, 
There's  a  k  in  his  name.
You  knew  
No  one  in  the  audience  and  just  to  help  you  out  I'll  block  them  from  view.
But  i  Don't  want  you  to  know  either  so  Swivel  around  on  your  chair, 
Your  right  hand  is  that  --  no, ok, 
Ok, tell  me  when  to  stop  
Yes, There's  one  
Ok, do  you  think  It's  here?
Neither  oh, ok, ,
We're  the  only  creatures  with  fully  developed  moral  sentiments  
After  10  years  of  experiments, i  found  it  
It  Can't  be  that  important  
Turns  out  it  Wasn't  so  easy  
And  when  It's  produced, it  has  a  Three-minute  half-life  and  Degrades  rapidly  at  room  temperature, 
Then  i  had  to  measure  morality  
So  i  started  smaller  
So  poor  countries  are  by  and  large, low  trust  countries  
So  we  recruit  some  people  for  an  experiment  
We  give  them  lots  of  instruction, and  we  never  ever  deceive  them.
So  think  about  this  experiment  for  minute  
But  why  
Two  things: 
I  Didn't  know, for  sure  oxytocin  caused  trustworthiness  
I  used  everything  short  of  a  drill  to  get  oxytocin  into  my  own  brain.
These  include  massage, dancing  and  praying  
In  this  book, smith  argued  that  we  are  moral  creatures, not  because  of  a  top-down  reason, but  for  a  bottom-up  reason, 
So  if  i  do  something  that  hurts  you, i  feel  that  pain  
I'm  working  at  a  gas  station  on  the  outskirts  of  santa  barbara, california, 
Tell  that  guy  to  wait  half  an  hour, 
So  this  is  a  classic  con  called  the  pigeon  drop.
They  have  many  of  the  attributes  of  Psychopaths  
One  is  through  Improper, nurturing  ,
So  We've, studied  sexually  abused  women  and  about  half  those  Don't  release  oxytocin  on  stimulus  
She  had  the  biggest  increase  in  oxytocin  
So  i  think  it  tells  us  that  We've  designed  this  ritual  to  connect  us  to  this  new  couple, connect  us, emotionally  
So  my  Penchant  for  hugging  other  people  has  earned  me  the  nickname  dr.
We  have  found  that  people  who  release  more  oxytocin  are  happier.
And  They're  happier  because  they  have  better  relationships  of  all  types.
I'll  play  at  these  rock  shows  be  on  stage, standing  completely  still  and  They're  like  What's. She  doing  What's.
So  basically, with  both  of  your  hands, You're  controlling  pitch  and  volume  and  kind  of  trying  to  create  the  illusion  that  You're  doing  separate  notes  when  really  It's  continuously  going  
Maybe  We'll  go  into  the  next  tune, because  i  totally  lost  where  this  is  going  
It  was  invented  around  the  1920s  and  the  inventor, Léon  theremin  --  he  also  was  a  musician, besides  an  inventor  --  he  came  up  with  the  idea  for  making  the  theremin.
And  then  also  You're  trying  to  stay  very, very, very  still.
And  It's  meant  to  kind  of  reflect  how  we  engage  with  histories  or  stories  on  the  internet  in  a  less  linear  form.
He  was  sent  in  1907  to  palestine  by  the  Zionist  organization  to  look  at  areas  for  jewish  settlement  and  acquire  land  for  jewish  settlement  
During  the  course  of  this  trial, all  of  the  rabbits  died, except  for  a  few  which  were  euthanized  
So  when  you  look  at  a  detail  of  this  work, you  can  see  the  man  on  the  Upper-left  is  the  father  of  the  woman  sitting  next  to  him.
During  the  time  i  was  in  bosnia, the  mortal  remains  of  Zumra's. Eldest, son  were  exhumed  from  a  mass  grave.
However, the  other  individuals  are  represented  by  these  blue  slides, which  show  tooth  and  bone  samples  that  were  matched  to  dna  evidence, collected  from  family  members  to  prove  they  were  the  identities  of  those  individuals.
There's  also  parents  who  participated  who  Wouldn't  let  their  children  participate, because  they  thought  they  were  too  young  to  decide  for  themselves.
It  was  released  in  poland  to  create  friction  between  frank  and  hitler.
Again, talking  about  fate, i  was  interested  in  the  stories.
Chapter  12, highlights  people  being  born  into  a  battle  that  is  not  of  their  making, but  becomes  their  own  .
I'm, not  quite  sure, whether  i  really  want  to  see  a  Snare  drum  at  nine  o'clock  or  so  in  the  morning, 
And  it  sounds  quite  simple, but  actually  It's  quite  a  big  big  job.
I  will  follow  the  instructions.
But  here  I'm  being  told  that  the  piece  of  music  is  very  quick  
Just  the  basic  feeling  
We  have  to  listen  to  ourselves, first  of  all  
And  i  just  feel  at  last  one  with  the  stick  and  one  with  the  drum  
Not  just  translate  them, but  interpret  them  
Can  be  felt  with  just  the  tiniest  part  of  your  finger.
Every  single  one  of  us  depending  on  where  We're  sitting  will  experience  this  sound  quite  quite  differently.
Do  you  see  what  i  mean.
May  be  great  there, but  terrible  up  there  
We  just  --  we  go  like  that, and  we  imagine  that  That's  what  deafness  is  about  
In  a  Year's  time, it  could  be  two  extra  steps.
For  me  as  a  musician, who  deals  with  99  percent  of  new  music  It's  very  easy  for  me  to  say, oh  yes, i  like  that  piece, 
Oh  no, i  Don't  like  that  piece.
And  please  try  to  create  that  through  your  clapping.
Very  good  snow  snow, have  you  ever  heard  snow  
Evelyn  Glennie, well, then  stop  clapping.
See  You're  awake, 
However, not  one  of  you  got  out  of  your  seats  to  think, right, how  can  i  clap?
I  may  feel  Sorrowful  or  happy  or  Exhilarated  or  angry  when  i  play  certain  pieces  of  music, but  I'm, not  necessarily  wanting  you  to  feel  exactly  the  same  thing.
The  performer  is  in  the  worst  possible  position  for  the  actual  sound  because  They're  hearing  the  contact  of  the  stick  on  the  drum  or  the  Mallet  on  the  bit  of  wood, or  the  bow  on  the  string, etc, or  the  breath  That's  creating  the  sound  from  wind  and  brass  
It's  a  video  game  move  from  star  fox.
And  We've  gone  from  one  board  to  48  boards  
What  the  Site's  known  for  because  it  has  this  environment  is  It's  fostered  the  creation  of  a  lot  of  internet  phenomena  viral  videos  and  whatnot  known  as  memes  
And  so  there  are  three  that  i  want  to  show  you  specifically  
It  is  where  a  third  of  all, the  traffic  is  going  
They  got  it  taken  Offline  and  managed  to  piss  off  part  of  the  internet.
So  We've  got  this  activist  group  That's  this  grassroots  group, That's  come  out  of  the  site  
Dusty  is  the  name  that  We've  given  to  this  cat  
We're  Sacrificing  a  lot  of  that.
You're  lucky  that  this  is  not  being  Streamed  to  them  live  right  now.
Well, you  never  know  some  of  them  --  We've  got  people  in  75  countries  out  there  watching  
Don't: tell  
And  saying, whatever  you  like, i  think, is  powerful  
And  the  thing  is, i  Didn't  make  it  into  that  presentation, because  i  Can't  read  to  you  anything  that  they  said, more  or  less  
Okay, well, 
You've  got  this  surprising  Semi-underground  influence, but  It's, not  making  you  a  lot  of  money.
Yeah, they  still  Didn't  know  what  to  think  of  that  though, 
Within  five  10  million  years  of  the  Bolide  impact, we  had  a  whole  variety  of  animals  going  into  the  water. Why  Didn't?
You  want  to  measure  it  by  diversity, 
This  slide  was  shown  before  this  is  the  famous  jurassic  bird  archaeopteryx  ,
If  we  could  roll  that  first  video  clip, 
But  one  with  an  immense  chalkboard  in  the  middle  with  lots  of  little  areas  of  dinosaur  rock  if  you  could  survive  an  expedition, 
And  the  kinds  of  teams  they  bring  in  
So  you  are  finding  yourself  also  in  an  amazing  cultural  milieu  
You're  really  rubbing  shoulders  with  the  World's.
Here's  the  animal  that  was  causing  it  trouble.
It  is  an  incredible  view  of  life. And  it  really  began  when  we  began  to  understand  the  depth  of  time.
We  prototyped  by  Cat-scanning, the  brain  out  of  this  animal  
Now, this  field  is  just  --  and  of  course, science  in  general  --  is  just  --  adventure  
Narrator, if  they  can  just  land  it, this  croc  will  provide  useful  data  helping  paul  in  his  quest  to  understand  Sarcosuchus  
I've  got  it  I've  got  the  back  legs  
Paul  Sereno  Let's  get  this  tape  measure  on  him, put  it  right  there.
Wow, 
Anyway, you  find  other  things  too  
These  are  all  Landlubbing  animals, There's, a  couple  of  choices, 
And  you  take  those  four  instances  and  you  realize  you  have  a  complex  problem.
They  did  it  within  two  or  three  degrees  of  the  pole  to  maintain  similarity  between  continents, 
Now, we  have  divergence  over  time, but  We've  created  the  third  dimension  of  area  
I  was  a  total  failure  in  school, not  really  headed  to  graduate  high  school  
What  about  all  the  kids  like  me  that  were  in  school  --  kids  like  some  of  you  out  there  --  that  were  in  school  and  Didn't, get  a  chance  and  will  never  get  a  chance  to  participate  in  science  and  technology  
Because  when  you  go  out  there  as  a  scholar, and  you  try  to  find  out  Longitudinal  studies  track  records  like  that, there  essentially  are  very  few  if  none  
Thank  you  very  much  
And  as  a  little  girl, i  loved  the  idea  of  a  robot  that  interacted  with  us  much  more  like  a  helpful, trusted  sidekick  --  something  that  would  delight  us  enrich  our  lives  and  help  us  save  a  galaxy  or  two  
I  almost  lost  it  this  week, 
Leo, this  is  cookie  monster.
We  looked  at  psychological  involvement  --  how  much  empathy  did  you  feel  for  the  other  person?
We  looked  at  their  desire  to  cooperate  
Today, we  know  that  families  are  living  further  and  further  apart, and  that  definitely  takes  a  toll  on  family  relationships  and  family  bonds  over  distance.
And  as  Grandma-bot, she  can  now  play  really  play  with  my  sons  with  her  Grandsons  in  the  real  world, with  his  real  toys  
Another  was  a  computer  that  ran  the  same  Touch-screen  interface, ran  exactly  the  same  dialogues  
The  quality  of  advice  was  identical  
We've  invited  a  lot  of  kids  into  this  space, and  they  think  It's  pretty  cool.
That's  her  competition, 
Paula  radcliffe, the  one  person, who  is  sure  to  Snatch  the  big  paycheck  out  of  derartu  Tulu's  Under-underdog  hands  suddenly  grabs  her  leg  and  starts  to  fall  back  
They're, not  doing  26  miles  They're  doing  100  150  miles  at  a  time.
And  if  you  know  it, then  you  are  smarter  than  anybody  else  on  planet  earth.
Australopithecus  had  a  tiny  little  pea  brain  
The  only  problem  is  the  first  Edged  weapons  only  appeared  about  200000  years  ago.
We're, not  fast  
Her  uterus  would  be  torn  
Then  you  go  beyond  26  miles  into  the  distance  that  medical  science  also  told  us  would  be  fatal  to  humans  --  remember, Pheidippides  died  when  he  ran  26  miles  --  you  get  to  50  and  100  miles  and  suddenly  It's  a  different  game.
Well, emily  Baer  --  500  runners  --  she  finishes  in  eighth  place  in  the  top  10, even  though  she  stopped  at  all  the  aid  stations  to  Breastfeed  her  baby  during  the  race  --  and  yet  beat  492  other  people  
And  You'll  get  slower  and  slower  until  eventually  You're  back  to  running  the  same  speed.
Now, i  defy  you  to  come  up  with  any  other  physical  activity  --  and  please  Don't  say, golf  --  something  that  actually  is  hard  --  where  geriatrics  are  performing  as  well  as  they  did  as  teenagers  
Maybe  we  evolved  as  a  hunting  pack  animal  
Well, if  That's  true  a  couple  other  things  had  to  be  true  as  well  
The  key  to  being  part  of  a  hunting  pack  is  the  word  pack  
You  need  to  have  those  27-year-old  studs  at  the  peak  of  their  powers, ready  to  drop  the  kill.
You  Can't  be  hauling  all  your  crap  around  trying  to  chase  the  antelope  
He  pissed  me  off, let  him  go  chase  his  own  antelope  
Geronimo  used  to  say  that  my  only  friends  are  my  legs.
That's  because  an  apache  Triathlon  used  to  be  You'd  run  50  miles  across  the  desert, engage  in  Hand-to-hand, combat  steal, a  bunch  of  horses  and  slap  leather  for  home  
I  Didn't  do  yoga  I'm, not  ready.
So  hopefully  It's  something  we  can  all  benefit  from  
I  show  a  number  of  photographs  and  films, but  i  also  make  television  programs  books  and  some  advertising  all  with  the  same  concept.
I  was  fascinated  by  this  phenomenon.
Momentum  was  being  built  
I  then  went  on  wondering, whether  i  could  actually  replace  her  image. So  i  got  a  look-alike  of  diana  and  posed  her  in  the  right  positions  and  angles  and  created  something  that  was  in  or  existed  in  the  public  imagination.
So  this  is  an  image  of  diana  looking  at  Camilla  kissing  her  husband.
All  this  imagery  was  creating  a  lot  of  fuss, and  i  was  cited  as  a  disgusting  artist. The  press  were  writing  about  this  giving  full  pages  about  how  terrible  this  was  .
But  then  this  changed  suddenly  
I  was  sitting  next  to  someone  at  dinner  the  other  day, and  they  were  saying, There's  this  great  image  of  the  queen, sitting  outside  william  hill, 
I  explored  with  actually  dressing  up  as  the  celebrities  myself, 
And  me  as  the  queen  
I  then  continued  on  to  make  a  whole  body  of  work  about  marilyn  --  the  biggest  icon  of  all  --  and  trying  to  Titillate  by  shooting  through  doorways  and  Shutters  and  so  on  and  so  forth, and  only  showing  certain  angles  to  create  a  reality  that  obviously  is  completely  constructed  .
I  did  an  advertising  campaign  for  Schweppes, which  is  coca-cola.
Tony  blair  and  Cherie  and  again, the  Legalities  --  we  had  to  be  very  careful  
And  the  press  were  interviewing, and  i  was  signing  my  book.
And  in  fact, george  bush  and  tony  blair  are  having  great  fun  during  all  of  this  
So  there  was  a  lot  of  meaning  in  my  life, because  i  was  performing  this  type  of  research  during  the  day.
My  left  hemisphere  --  our  left  hemisphere  --  is  a  very  different  place.
Our  left  hemisphere  is  all  about  the  past  and  It's  all  about  the  future.
It's  that  ongoing  brain  chatter  that  connects  me  and  my  internal  world  to  my  external  world, 
I  become  a  single  solid  individual  separate  from  the  energy  flow  around  me  and  separate  from  you  
And  i  looked  down  at  my  body  and  i  thought, whoa, I'm  a  Weird-looking  thing.
I  Can't  define  where  i  begin, and  where  i  end  because  the  atoms  and  the  molecules  of  my  arm  blended  with  the  atoms  and  molecules  of  the  wall  
And  then  i  would  wait  for  what  i  call  a  wave  of  clarity.
And  so  i  say  to  him  --  clear  in  my  mind, i  say  to  him, this  is  jill.
Nirvana, i  found  nirvana, and  i  remember  thinking  There's, no  way  i  would  ever  be  able  to  squeeze  the  Enormousness  of  myself  back  inside  this  tiny, little  body  
Two  and  a  half  weeks  after  the  hemorrhage, the  surgeons  went  in, and  they  removed  a  blood  Clot  the  size  of  a  golf  ball  that  was  pushing  on  my  language  centers.
I  believe  that  the  more  time  we  spend  choosing  to  run  the  deep  Inner-peace  circuitry  of  our  right  hemispheres, the  more  peace, we  will  project  into  the  world. And  the  more  peaceful  our  planet  will  be  .
In  africa  --  where  it  is  a  major  killer  --  it  is  totally  ignored  
No, you  will  die. 50  percent  will  die  within  24  hours.
If  you  Cannot  secure  the  parents, you  Cannot  guarantee  the  security  of  the  african  child  
These  are  just  for  information.
So  they  spend  their  money  trying  to  fix  those  problems.
So  for  a  Radiopharmaceutical  in  the  us  --  that  You'll  get  a  unit  dose  for  250  dollars  --  when  We're  finished  manufacturing, it  in-house, we  come  at  a  price  of  about  two  dollars.
This  is  at  the  heart  institute, the  doctors  from  anywhere  can  log  in  
They'll  give  me  that  information  and  We'll  make  the  care  of  the  patient  better  
Because  if  you  Can't  get  it  in  nashville, you  can  travel  to  birmingham  two  hours  away  and  You'll  get  it  if  you  Can't  get  it. In  cleveland, you  can  go  to  cincinnati. We  Don't  have  that  luxury. So  we  have  to  make  it  happen.
So  we  emphasize  training  training  is  critical  
Sharon  Lazarus, i  am  an  Echocardiographer  at  the  heart  institute  of  the  caribbean. Since  the  past  two  years  i  received  training  at  this  institution.
I  think  I'll  start  out  and  just  talk  a  little  bit  about  what  exactly  autism  is  
I'm  really  concerned  that  a  lot  of  the  schools  have  taken  out  the  hands-on  classes  because  art  and  classes  like  that.
I  thought, everybody  thought  in  pictures  
Ok, there  is  my  childhood  church, That's, specific  There's.
But  one  of  the  things  that  really  worries  me  is  Where's  the  younger  version  of  those  kids  going  today.
And  then  There's  a  verbal  mind, they  know, every  fact  about  everything  
And  i  came  in  half  an  hour  beforehand, so  i  could  have  it  put  on  and  kind  of  get  used  to  it, and  they  got  it  bent  so  It's  not  hitting  my  chin.
Because  think  about  it, an  animal  is  a  Sensory-based  thinker, not  verbal  --  thinks  in  pictures  thinks  in  sounds  thinks  in  smells  
Are  they  friend  or  Foe, is  there  anybody  he  can  go  mate  with  
There's, a  ton  of  information  on  that  fire  hydrant  
Now, this  ability  to  put  information  into  categories  i  find  a  lot  of  people  are  not  very  good  at  this  
I  find  a  lot  of  people  have  difficulty  doing  that  
Is  it  a  minor  problem  with  something?
Yeah, I'm  a  Million-mile  flyer  
I  do  lots  and  lots  of  flying.
It  would  be  their  airplane  tails  
I  was  a  Goofball  student.
And  They're  not  going  down  the  right  path.
But  you  know  what  i  was  getting  work  experience.
In  other  words, use  that  Fixation  in  order  to  motivate  that  kid  That's, one  of  the  things  we  need  to  do  
The  pattern  thinkers, They're, the  ones  that  are  going  to  be  your  mathematicians, your  software, engineers, your  computer  programmers, all  of  those  kinds  of  jobs  
Because  the  thing  about  being  autistic  is, i  had  to  learn  social  skills  like  being  in  a  play.
I  Cannot  emphasize  enough, what  my  science  teacher  did  for  me  
Well, first  of  all  You've  got  to  look  at  age  
How  many  cattle  got  poked  with  the  Prodder  
Temple, can  i  just  say, It's  an  absolute  delight  to  have  you  at  ted  
Okay, 
Bye-bye  
When  they  were  a  bunch  of  kids, they  were  kind  of  very  imaginative, very  adventurous, as  they  were  trying  at  caltech  to  mix  chemicals  and  see  which  one  blows  up  more  
So  That's  what  we  call  our  first  five  employees  during  the  tea  break, you  know, in  here, 
And  that  was  done  over  a  period  of  a  couple  of  years. And  now  we  are  the  leading  organization, you  know, exploring  space  on  all  of  your  behalf.
But  even  when  we  did  that, we  had  to  remind  ourselves, sometimes  there  are  setbacks.
But  then  also  just  to  celebrate  that  we  started  an  event  at  jpl  for  miss  guided  missile.
Maybe  They're  right  - .
So  next  time  you  are  really  depressed  look  in  the  mirror, and  you  can  look  and  say, hi  I'm, looking  at  a  star  here.
So  it  is  a  dynamic  planet  and  activity  is  going  on  as  we  speak  today.
As  i  told  you, geologists, love  craters, 
If  you  were  there, you  Wouldn't  do  it  yourself  
And  That's  what  we  found  out  it  turned  out  that  every  once  in  a  while  there  are  dust  devils, which  come  by  on  mars  as  you  are  seeing  here. And  when  the  dust  devil  comes  over  the  rover, it  just  cleans  it  up.
Yeah, 
It's, the  first  mission  That's  going  to  try  to  land  near  the  north  pole  of  mars  and  It's. The  first  mission  That's  actually  going  to  try  and  reach  out  and  touch  water  on  the  surface  of  another  planet.
The  outside  can  get  almost  as  hot  as  the  surface  of  the  sun.
The  temperature  of  the  heat  shield  can  reach  2600  degrees  fahrenheit  
The  fabric  and  the  Stitching  could  just  pull  apart  
We  kick  them, we  hit  them.
And  i  know, many  of  you  kind  of  last  time  afterwards  said, well, that  was  a  cool  thing  to  have  --  those  airbags  
It's, real  stuff, 
So  the  idea  is  by  watching  saturn  We're  actually  watching  our  solar  system  in  real  time, being  formed  on  a  smaller  scale.
Now, you  think  that  those  rings  are  very  large  objects, 
That  was  [unclear]  also  --  you  know, because  we  were  worried  about  the  risk  of  it, but  it  worked  pretty  well.
So  people  believe  now  that  titan  is  most  likely  what  we  call  a  Pre-biotic  planet  because  It's  so  cold, organic  material  did  not  get  to  the  stage  of  becoming  biological  material. And  therefore  life  could  have  evolved  on  it.
So  here  we  have  a  cycle  of  a  planet, which  is  like  our  earth, but  is  all  made  of  ethane  and  methane  and  organic  material  
And  being  the  current  day, of  course, we  started  our  own  facebook  group.
Now, why  am  i  telling  you  this  story?
What  I'd  like  to  talk  about  today  is  understanding  these  exponential  technologies.
And  coming  up  next  month  is  actually  future  med  a  program  to  help  cross-train  and  leverage  technologies  into  medicine  
These  mobile  phones  have  over  20000  different  mobile  apps  available  --  to  the  point  where  There's  one  out  of  the  uk  
Let's  start  with  faster.
We  can  look  inside  with  real  time  fmri  --  in  the  brain  at  real  time, 
The  scan  in  a  couple  of  years  will  be  one  Terabyte  or  800000, books  
And  now, of  course, We're  in  the  era  of  the  ipad, even  the  ipad, 2  
The  ability  to  interact  with  your  health  care  provider  is  different  
Consumers  now  can  buy  basically  hundred-dollar  devices  like  this  little  Fitbit  
So  a  few  examples  We're  now, in  the  era  of  fantastic  voyage  the  Ipill  
And  this  is  really  going  to  leverage  technology  to  the  rural  and  the  Under-served  and  enable  what  used  to  be  Thousand-dollar  tests  to  be  done  at  pennies.
My  data  indicates  that  I've  got  about  average  risk  for  developing  macular  degeneration, a  kind  of  blindness  
I'm  at  almost  twice  the  risk  for  type  ii  diabetes, 
It  might  change  my  behavior  
We  can  capture  that  information  
This  has  been  called  by  lee  hood, the  father  of  the  field  P4  medicine, 
How  about  more  targeted  therapies  for  cancer  
Now, I'll  close  with  regenerative  medicine  
Geron, just  last  year  started  the  first  trial  using  human  embryonic  stem  cells  to  treat  spinal  cord  injuries  
Still  a  phase  i  trial, but  evolving  
I  thought  i  would  read  poems.
My  grandmother  is  washing  my  mouth  out  with  soap, half  a  long  century  gone. And  still  she  comes  at  me  with  that  thick.
It's  a  longer  poem, 
It's  called  the  neighbor  
Her  shadow  once  Fumbling  the  chain  on  her  door, then  the  door, slamming  Fearfully, shut  only  the  barking  and  the  music  --  jazz  --  filtering  as  it  does  day  and  night  into  the  hall.
My  thinking  We'd  meet  recognize  one  another  become  friends  that  I'd  accomplish  a  Penance  
Sometimes  there  are  frightening  Goings-on  in  the  stairwell.
Medea  she  was  next  time.
My  holding  the  door  
Instead  I'd  step  into  my  train, 
The  dance  of  our  Glances, the  clash, pulling  each  other  through  our  perceptual  Punctures, then  holocaust  holocaust  host  on  host  of  ill, injured  Presences, Squandered, consumed  
The  dance  of  our  Glances  challenge, Abdication  Effacement, the  perfume  of  our  Consternation  
Forever  with  grace  
But  I'm  afraid  that  ricky  will  come  out  here  and  shake  his  Fist  at  me, 
Special  big  Tits  says, the  advertisement  for  a  Soft-core  magazine  on  our  neighborhood.
But  forget  her  breasts  
The  display  was  a  photo  men  and  women  stripped  naked, some  trying  to  cover  their  Genitals  others, too  frightened  to  bother  lined  up  in  snow, waiting  to  be  shot  and  thrown  into  a  ditch  
What  Carnal  Mistrust  had  their  teacher  taught  them  
The  truth  is  that  we  know  that  the  images  themselves, Don't  change  the  world, but  We're  also  aware  that  since  the  beginning  of  photography, images  have  provoked  reactions  in  people. And  those  reactions  have  caused  change  to  happen.
It  changed  our  view  of  the  physical  world.
Some  would  argue  that  it  is  those  images  that  did  more  to  fuel  the  insurgency  in  iraq  than  virtually  any  other  single  act  
In  fact, these  images  became  the  voices  of  protest  themselves.
I  was  the  only  human  being  in  an  area  one-and-a-half  times  the  size  of  america, Five-and-a-half  thousand  square  miles  
Ben  I've  read  somewhere  that  at  minus  40, exposed  skin  becomes  frostbitten  in  less  than  a  minute. So  how  do  you  answer? The  call  of  nature?
Third  one: how  do  you  top  that  What's?
I  was  23  years  old. No  one  my  age  had  attempted  anything  like  this. And  pretty  quickly  almost  everything  that  could  have  gone  wrong. Did  go  wrong?
I  had  frostbite  in  my  left  big  toe, 
You  can  just  see  --  There's, a  nine  and  a  string  of  zeros  here.
I  dialed  three  numbers.
The  --  the  whole  world  underneath  me, 
There  are  huge  areas  of  open  water, just  south  of  your  position.
Antarctica  if  you  include  the  ice  shelves  is  twice  the  size  of  australia  --  It's  a  big  place.
And  they  turned  around  headed  back  to  the  coast  and  all  five  of  them  died  on  the  return  journey.
Where  was  this  guilt  trip  coming  from  
There  was  one  person  in  the  group  that  was  supposed  to  have  very  high  performance  that  was  actually  performing  terribly  
And  he  pulled  the  whole  mean  down  destroying  my  statistical  significance  of  the  test  
So  i  looked  carefully  at  this  guy, 
And  I'm  sure  that  It's  something  that  we  all  recognize  and  we  see  that  it  happens.
And  That's  a  much  much  more  difficult  lesson  to  take  into  account  
In  my  mind, i  was  actually  a  knight  trying  to  help  science  move  along  
I  mean, this  is  all  very  depressing, right  --  people  have  conflicts  of  interest. We  Don't  see  it.
This  is  actually  a  direct  quote  from  an  Epidemiologist  Who's  been  in  field  of  hiv  for  15  years, worked  on  four  continents  and  You're, looking  at  her  
And  so  everyone  lined  up  all  the  Smackheads  in  a  row  and  the  guy  whose  birthday  it  was  filled  up  the  fit, and  he  went  down  and  started  injecting  people.
So  his  choice  was  either  to  accept  that  dirty  needle  or  not  to  get  high  
So  What's  that  about, is  it  like  you  get  a  better  high  if  you  share  or  something  
So  she  was  making  a  politically  rational  decision  
I've  always  been  a  bit  curious  about  that, because  i  think  stigma  is  a  bad  thing, whereas  lots  of  sex  is  quite  a  good  thing.
Of  course, you  Can't  get  hiv  just  by  having  unprotected  sex  
And  again, It's  because  of  an  alignment  of  the  incentives, 
And  actually  clients  Don't  want  to  go  home  with  a  drip  either  
He's  from  haiti, and  he  has  aids  
And  the  other  thing  is  that  people  are  simply  not  as  scared  of  hiv  as  they  were  of  aids  and  rightly  so  
We've  got  the  tools, the  knowledge  and  the  cash  and  commitment  to  preventing  hiv  too  
There  are  as  many  different  ways  of  being  rational  as  there  are  human  beings  on  the  planet  and  That's  one  of  the  glories  of  human  existence.
Ten  years  ago, exactly  i  was  in  afghanistan, 
Would  you  like  to  see  civil  war, sectarian  killing  
They  found  something  called  facebook  
This  is  what  they  were  telling. This  is  their  propaganda.
And  this  is  how  the  revolution  was  born  in  tunisia.
But  we  found  that  these  people  in  the  street, all  of  them  are  our  reporters  feeding  our  newsroom  with  pictures  with  videos.
We  are  going  to  be  the  voice  for  these  Voiceless.
Be  aware  of  these  people  who  [are]  coming  to  you  in  order  to  ruin  your  great  civilization.
They  have  been  detached  from  their  people  from  the  masses. And  now  we  are  seeing  them  collapsing.
I  felt  the  responsibility  to  phone  our  Correspondents  there  and  to  phone  our  newsroom  and  to  tell  them  make  your  best  not  to  switch  off  the  cameras  at  night. Because  the  guys  there  really  feel  confident  when  someone  is  reporting  their  story  --  and  they  feel  protected  as  well.
We  have  a  chance  to  go  and  to  think  of  the  future  as  something  which  is  open  to  the  world.
Let  us  free  ourselves  --  especially  in  the  west  --  from  thinking  about  that  part  of  the  world  based  on  oil  interest, or  based  on  interests  of  the  illusion  of  stability  and  security  
Is  this  a  Story-of-the-year, a  Story-of-the-decade  or  something  more  
In  my  opinion, these  people  are  much  more  wiser  than  not  only  the  political  elite, even  the  intellectual  elite  even  opposition  leaders, including  political  parties, 
Thank  you  so  much  
And  I'm  going  to  have  michael  Manring, play  bass  with  me, 
She  got  mad.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, black-eyed  susie! Hey, .
One  more  time  now, 
I  fell  in  love  with  that  
The  old  jack  tales  that  he  had  learned  --  he  talked  like  this, you  could  hardly  understand  him, but  it  was  really  wonderful.
It  was  hard  on  the  cats, but  it  made  a  great  little  instrument.
And  if  you  Don't  know  what  You're  doing  your  hands  are  bleeding  in  no  time  
Good  news  Chariot's  coming  ,
And  i  Don't  want  it  to  leave  me  behind  
Now, my  mother  hoped  that  we  learned  from  that  the  value  of  hard  work  
No  we  learned  something  else  
The  first  thing  i  learned  that  day  was  that  i  never  ever  wanted  to  work  that  hard.
But  that  day  in  the  cotton  field  out  there  picking, when  those  people  started  singing, i  realized  i  was  in  the  very  heart  of  real  music  and  That's  where  I've  wanted  to  be  ever  since  
Good  news  Chariot's  coming  ,
It  was  a  few  years  ago, but  i  sort  of  remembered  this  story, and  i  told  it  at  a  concert  
My  mom  was  in  the  audience.
I  just  wanted  you  boys  to  learn  the  value  of  hard  work.
And  i  Don't  want  it  to  leave  me  behind  
I  just  break  off  another  bottleneck  and  play  these  steel  guitar  blues.
They  were  about  my  age  
It  had  three  chemicals. We  were  really  surprised  to  see  sulfur  potassium  nitrate  and  charcoal.
We  tore  everything  down  and  buried  it  in  his  backyard.
We  have  about  120  million  dollars, and  we  want  to  do  it.
The  first  thing  that  anybody  who  knows  science  and  has  been  around  science  is  that  the  stuff  you  learn  in  school  as  a  scientific  method  is  wrong.
I’m  not  going  to  read  them  all  to  you  because  I’m, not  in  teacher  mode, 
And  i  want  to  talk  about  three  stages  in  that  evolution  
In  that  year, we  are  not  available  for  any  of  our  clients  
We  are  totally  closed  
Quite  the  similar  idea, then  a  perfume  packaged  in  a  book  in  a  die, cut  
I  likely  already  look  forward  to  the  weekend  on  Thursdays  
Europe, and  the  us  Didn't  really  feel  Enticing  because  i  knew  them  too  well.
So  i  looked  for  furniture  
So  one  of  the  things  that  we  pursued  in  bali  was  pieces  of  furniture  
And  i  think, by  the  time  this  lamp  came  about, i  had  finally  made  peace  with  those  dogs.
I  also  started  meditating  for  the  first  time  in  my  life  in  bali  
His  latest  numbers  are  fairly  impressive  
So  i  became  my  own  intern  
I  had  fun  
Financially  seen  over  the  long  term, it  was  actually  successful  
We  were  asked  to  design  an  identity  for  casa  da  musica  the  rem  Koolhaas-built  music  center  in  Porto  in  portugal, 
It  has  a  more  transparent  identity  
Some  of  you  might  have  seen  it  
So  after  eight  hours  That's  pretty  much  all  that  was  left  of  the  whole  thing.
So  I'll, just  give  you  my  message  up. Front  try  not  to  go  extinct.
People  ask  me  a  lot  --  in  fact, one  of  the  most  asked  questions  i  get  is, why  do  children  like  dinosaurs  so  much?
Every  museum  wanted  a  little  bigger  or  better  one  than  anybody  else  had  
So  everyone  was  out  looking  for  all  these  bigger  and  better  dinosaurs.
And  they  thought  about  it, and  they  even  wrote  papers  about  it, where  are  the  little  dinosaurs?
First  off  scientists  have  egos  and  scientists  like  to  name  dinosaurs  
So  this  is  where  people  went  astray  again, 
But  i  have  a  museum  and  i  collect  dinosaurs, and  i  can  saw  mine  open  
And  if  you  cut  into  an  older  dinosaur, It's  very  massive  
So  Here's  a  dinosaur  that  has  spikes  sticking  out  of  its  head, no  dome  and  Gnarly  stuff  on  its  nose  
Nobody  noticed  the  Gnarly  stuff  sort  of  looked  alike  
Dracorex  is  the  Littlest  one  stygimoloch  is  the  middle  size. One.
But  it  Didn't  give  them  a  clue.
So  we  have  a  whole  bunch  of  them  at  our  museum  
And  then, as  they  grow  older, the  horns  grow  forward  
If  you  look  along  the  edge  of  the  frill, they  have  these  little  triangular  bones  that  actually  grow  big  as  triangles.
And  we  get  rid  of  anatotitan  
So, again, real  easy  to  say  that  tyrannosaurus  ontogeny  included  Nanotyrannus.
Now, as  you  can  imagine, this  is  not  very  popular  with  fourth-graders  
This  is  soft  sell  for  42nd  street.
They  Weren't  doing  their  primary  work, which  was  for  the  government  while  they  were  helping  us  with  this  
And  many  musicians  choose  to  use  the  theater  glass  walls  totally  open  
Chamber  and  the  notion  of  chamber  has  to  do  with  Salons  and  small-scale  performances.
And  this  is  a  Mockup  that  is  in  salt  lake  city  that  gives  you  a  sense  of  what  this  is  going  to  look  like  in  full-scale  
Chris  has  been  so  nice  
So  nice  all  week, He's, the  kind  of  man, you  could  say  to  chris  I'm, really  sorry, I've  crashed  your  car  
And  you  know  that  chris  would  say, thank  you  
Emmanuel, absolutely  
So  That's  going  to  look  pretty  Shabby  now, 
So  what  i  thought  I'd  do  is  --  in  honor  of  emmanuel  --  is  what  i  can  do  is  to  launch  today.
And  He'll  say, You're  offering  me  things  that  are  infinitely  variable  
And  She's  desperate  to  find  more  evidence  for  the  link.
This  man  has  Swum  around  the  north  pole. What  more  evidence  do  you  want?
No  
Alright, it  was  never  exactly  'brokeback  Mountain'. You  know, i  wrote  to  him  just  before  i  left  office. I   said, 'can, i  rely  on  your  support  for  the  next  Month'.
When  you  think  What's  happened  to  financial  services, and  you  see  What's  happened  to  the  economy. You  think, well, there  is  a  man  who  delivers  on  his  promises.
And  you  know  iceland, it  was  never  going  to  cut  it.
Luckily, somebody  like  george  bush  was  really  helpful  
He  summed  it  up, really  at  a  dinner  
And  then  You're  now, well, actually  That's  what  this  is  about  
Well, you  know, I'm, sorry  about  that  
And  you  want  a  leader  who  inspires  and  challenges  and  makes  you  want  to  be  a  better  citizen  right?
So  he  comes  over  to  this  country, and  he  says, we  need  a  big  fiscal  stimulus  
He  goes  to  prague.
Do  you  remember  that  george  bush, a  Nu-ca-ler  
Who  said  reach  out  and  touch  
So  nelson, how  would  you  like  a  nice  water  feature?
And  we  need  six  to  eight  Waist-high  plants  per  person.
And  it  has  close  to  1200  such  plants  for  300  Occupants  
Our  studies  have  found  that  there  is  a  42  percent  probability  of  One's  blood  oxygen  going  up  by  one  percent.
And  the  study  showed  that  compared  to  other  buildings, there  is  a  reduced  incidence  of  eye  irritation  by  52  percent  respiratory  systems  by  34  percent  headaches  by  24  percent  lung  impairment  by  12  percent  and  asthma  by  nine  percent  
Why  is  this  important  
So, how  do  you  feel  about  that  --  the  whole  --  ma, well, It's, pretty  Irritating, actually, because  nobody  ever  describes  what  a  man  is  wearing  
And  no  guy  ever  gets  criticized, but  That's, the  least  of  it  
How  did  you  handle  that  balance  between  being  the  tough  diplomatic  and  strong  voice  of  this  country  to  the  rest  of  the  world, and  also  how  you  felt  about  yourself  as  a  mother, a  grandmother, nurturing  ,
And  so  how  did  you  handle  that  
Because  in  her  lifetime  --  ma, that  would  be  so  
Thank  you  for  joining  us  today.
My  little  group  of  molecular  programmers  are  trying  to  Refashion  all  of  these  parts  from  dna  
And  if  you  buy  all  of  this  and  you  think  life  is  about  computation  as  i  do, then  you  look  at  big  questions  through  the  eyes  of  a  computer  scientist, 
This  is  exactly  analogous  to  the  question.
And  just  as  He's  writing, you  know, bacteria  that  will  be  smaller, He's  writing  genomes  that  will  work. We  could  write  smaller  programs  that  would  do  what  microsoft  word  does.
Now, these  are  big  questions  in  computer: science, 
That  holds  the  long  strand  like  this  
I  wanted  to  fold  dna  into  something  that  goes  up  over  the  eye  down  the  nose  up  the  nose  around  the  forehead  back  down  and  end  in  a  little  loop  like  this  
It's  got  a  needle  like  a  record  needle  that  goes  back  and  forth  over  the  surface, bumps  up  and  down  and  feels  the  height  of  the  first  surface.
She  wrote  all  her  own  software  to  design  and  built  this  dna  origami, a  beautiful  rendition  of  china, which  even  has  taiwan. And  you  can  see  It's, sort  of  on  the  World's, shortest  leash  right  .
Now, this  is  just  a  single  switch, and  you  need  half  a  billion  for  a  computer.
The  dna  origami  is  a  proof  that  that  compiler  actually  works  
The  fact  is  that  it  does  not  scale  
So  now  we  can  use  this  counting  to  try  and  get  at  much  bigger  things  than  dna  origami  could  otherwise  
You  can  just  change  a  couple  of  the  dna  strands  in  this  binary  representation  and  You'll, get  96, rather  than  32  
Here  is  a  dna  origami  rectangle. And  here  are  some  tiles  growing  from  it.
So  it  turns  out  we  actually  had  this  idea  nine  years  ago  and  That's  about  the  time  constant  for  how  long  it  takes  to  do  these  kinds  of  things.
We've  got  ideas  about  how  to  fix  these  errors  
What  It's  really  about  is  taking  computer  science  and  looking  at  big  questions  in  a  new  light, asking  new  versions  of  those  big  questions  and  trying  to  understand  how  biology  can  make  such  amazing  things. Thank  you.
Therefore  it  would  be  too  risky  to  release  these  animals, both  for  the  released, and  for  the  natural  populations.
So  this  is  not  new. People  have  been  doing  this  around  the  world.
So  these  genes  are  indeed  going  back  to  the  populations.
So  i  say, Let's  study  more  Let's  shed  light  on  this  issue.
This  song  kind  of  came  out  of  all  of  that  
We  ended  up  being  the  first  medical  response  team  in  every  incident  location  and  transported  125  victims, saving  life, 
And  the  other  is  Moksha-yug  access, which  is  integrating  rural  supply  chain  on  the  foundations  of  self-help  Group-based, microfinance, 
Now, i  come  back  to  the  idea  of  the  new  social  enterprise  that  I'm  exploring  
Often  it  is  the  Constraining  or  the  Back-to-the-wall  situation  that  the  hapless  common  man  finds  himself  or  herself  in  that  leads  him  to  pay  a  bribe  
Now, let  me  ask  you  another  question: ,
But  you  also  Don't  have  the  time  resources  expertise  or  Wherewithal  to  fight  this  
Like  a  bribe  Buster  service  or  1-800-fight-bribes  or  Wwwstopbribesorg  or  Wwwpreventcorruptionorg  
I  Don't  want  to  be  haunted  by  such  images, any  more  
A  set  of  people  actually  say, oh, let  me  just  grant  it  to  them  and  run  away  from  it.
But  the  one  thing  i  want  you  to  notice  about  them  is  this, even  though  this  is  a  very  long  list, there  Isn't  a  single  thing  on  it  that  involves  other  human  beings.
And  yet, when  some  psychologists  interviewed  hospital  janitors  to  get  a  sense  of  what  they  thought  their  jobs  were  like  they  encountered  mike, who  told  them  about  how  he  stopped  Mopping  the  floor  because  mr  jones  was  out  of  his  bed, getting  a  little  exercise, trying  to  build  up  his  strength, walking  slowly  up  and  down  the  hall  
And  then  there  was  luke  who  washed  the  floor  in  a  Comatose  young  Man's  room  twice  because  the  Man's  father  who  had  been  keeping  a  vigil  for  six  months. Didn't  see  luke. Do  it  the  first  time? And  his  father  was  angry.
A  wise  person  knows  when  and  how  to  make  the  exception  to  every  rule  as  the  janitors  knew  when  to  ignore  the  job  duties  in  the  service  of  other  objectives, 
A  wise  person  is  like  a  jazz  musician  --  using  the  notes  on  the  page, but  dancing  around  them  inventing  combinations  that  are  appropriate  for  the  situation.
A  wise  person  knows  how  to  use  these  moral  skills  in  the  service  of  the  right  aims.
Dad  being  an  academic  had  no  idea  that  Mike's  hard  lemonade  contained  alcohol  
And  they  were  ready  to  let  the  kid  go  
When  things  go  wrong  as  of  course, they  do  we  reach  for  two  tools  to  try  to  fix  them.
Say, 75  items  in  this  script  to  teach  a  25-page  picture  book, 
Scripts  like  these  are  insurance  policies  against  disaster  
Jazz  musicians  need  some  notes  --  most  of  them  need  some  notes  on  the  page.
We  need  more  rules  for  the  bankers.
Some  psychologists  went  around  and  Polled  citizens  who  were  very  well  informed  
They  said, if  we  paid  you  six  Weeks'  salary  every  year, would  you  be  willing  to  have  a  nuclear  waste  dump  in  your  community?
We  see  this  in  medicine  
I  Don't  know  how  many  of  you  remember  this  another  moral  hero?
And  a  bonus  He's  discovering  is  He's  actually  going  to  make  even  more  money.
In  many  ways, this  is  the  perfect  example: 
So  There's  a  lot  here  at  ted  and  at  other  places  to  celebrate  
There  are  ordinary  heroes  
Even  the  Wisest  and  most  well-meaning  people  will  give  up  if  they  have  to  swim  against  the  current  in  the  organizations  in  which  they  work  
And  any  moral  work  depends  upon  practical  wisdom  
I  think  there  is  reason  for  hope, 
Thank  you  
A  few  years  ago  i  was  visited  by  the  guy  that  runs  darpa  the  people  that  fund  all  the  advanced  technologies  that  businesses  and  universities, probably  Wouldn't, take  the  risk  of  doing  
Now, We've  got  F18s  and  F22s. And  if  somebody  loses  an  arm, we  give  them  a  plastic  stick  with  a  hook  on  it.
If  It's  the  raisin, they  Won't  drop, it  
I  told  them  They're  nuts, 
It  will  take  the  other  nine  to  make  it  functional  and  useful  
I  went  back, and  i  started  putting  a  team  together  the  best  guys  i  could  find  with  a  passion  to  do  this  
We  walked  into  walter  reed, and  i  could  not  have  been  more  wrong.
I  can  give  you  fast  control  with  low  reduction  ratios  in  these  gears, or  i  can  give  you  power.
I  lost  my  right  arm, but  I'm, a  lefty  
So  we  went  back  
So  we  went  back  and  We've  been  working  harder  yet, 
And  he  was  there, and  they  said, we  needed  to  come  
He's  got  no  arms  
Who  is  going  to  pay  for  it?
Those  are  tough  questions: 
I  Don't  know  the  answers  
What  do  we  need  to  do  There's  very  polarized  answers  to  that  question, too?
I  think  eventually  We'll  make  these  things.
And  whining  and  complaining  about  what  our  foreign  policy  ought  to  be  
And  we  ought  to  give  it  to  them  
That  one  was  way  more  difficult  than  i  had  expected.
When  the  rescue  workers  came, they  resuscitated  him, and  there  was  no  brain  damage.
So  i  took  that  as  a  challenge  basically  
And  i  stayed  inside  of  that  water  tank, hoping  my  core  temperature  would  start  to  drop  
So  i  realized  that  was  completely  not  going  to  work  
So  i  went  to  talk  to  a  doctor  friend, and  i  asked  him, how  could  i  do  that  
Then  i  actually  started  thinking  about  liquid  breathing  
You  blow  in  and  out  
And  You're  really  Ridding  your  body  of  co2  
And  his  total  lung  capacity  is  twice  the  size  of  an  average  person.
I  had  to  drop  50  pounds  in  three  months.
Every  bit  of  food  was  exactly  what  it  was  for  its  nutritional  value.
And  i  started  to  really  adapt  my  body  
I  assumed  that  i  could  put  a  water  tank  at  lincoln  center. And  if  i  stayed  there  a  week  not  eating, i  would  get  comfortable  in  that  situation. And  i  would  slow  my  metabolism, which  i  was  sure  would  help  me  hold  my  breath  longer  than  i  had  been  able  to  do  it.
And  i  thought  everything  seemed  to  be  on  track  
And  by  seven  minutes, i  had  gone  into  these  awful  convulsions, 
This  was  a  different  record. This  was  a  pure  O2, static  apnea  record  that  guinness  had  set  the  world  record  at  13  minutes.
A  Hypoxic  tent  is  a  tent  that  Simulates  altitude  at  15000  feet  
But  for  tv, they  wanted  me  to  be  upright, so  they  could  see  my  face  basically, 
That  made  me  extremely  nervous  raising  the  heart  rate.
And  there  is  no  way  to  slow  my  heart  rate  down  
And  i  started  having  Ischemia  to  the  heart  
My  heartbeat  would  go  from  120  to  50  to  150  to  40  to  20  to  150.
So  i  let  my  feet  out, and  i  started  floating  to  the  top  
They  had  doctors  with  the  Pst, you  know.
As  a  magician, i  try  to  show  things  to  people  that  seem  impossible  
And  then  he  stopped  walking  in  front  of  him, was  her  
Sure, she  had  aged  a  little  
Gusty  entered  her  boldly  and  made  love  to  her  Rhythmically  while  she  filmed  him  because  she  was  a  keen, amateur  Pornographer, 
And  that  provides  the  ground  for  a  type  of  action.
We  have  three  critical  terms  economy, civil  society  and  the  state  
We  propose  10  
The  least  important  form  of  capital  in  this  project  is  financial  capital  --  money, ,
Now, the  issue  that  should  concern  us  here  --  and  That's  the  challenge  that  i  would  like  to  pose  to  this  group  --  is, again, it  takes  16  years  in  your  countries  to  produce  somebody  with  a  bs  degree.
Every  conceivable  form  of  infrastructure  had  broken  down  
So  when  violence  Erupts  in  a  country  like  afghanistan, It's  because  of  that  legacy  
Look  There's: a  very  little  known  fact  countries  that  have  a  legal  average, income  per  capita  of  1000  dollars.
Cotton  does  not  compete  with  opium.
I'm  all  for  it  after  all, i  raised  a  lot  of  it  
And  then  I'll, let  you  in  on  a  secret, which  is  why  i  am  an  incurable  optimist.
Well, It's  been  calculated  a  few  Degrees'  rise  in  the  Earth's  temperature  would  melt  the  polar  ice  caps.
And  the  trends  for  those  who  are  at  the  periphery  of  our  society  who  are  the  poorest  and  the  most  vulnerable, the  trends  give  rise  to  a  great  case  for  pessimism  
It  will  cause  rising  seas. It  will  cause  Saline  deposited  into  wells  and  into  lands.
For  some  it  will  lead  to  anger, religious  and  sectarian  violence  and  terrorism.
A  minimum  of  20  to  30  inches  of  increase  in  sea  levels  is  the  best  case  that  we  can  hope  for.
Enough  of  the  bad  news, human  beings  have  always  risen  to  the  challenge  
20  years  ago, there  were  three  and  a  half  million  
This  disease  is  called  sudden  wealth  syndrome  
All  throughout  the  technology  world, We're  seeing  young  people  bitten  by  this  disease  of  sudden, wealth  syndrome  
More  reasons  to  be  optimistic  in  the  '60s, and  i  am  a  creature  of  the  '60s. There  was  a  movement.
And  on  july  7th  around  the  world, i  learned  only  yesterday, there  will  be  global  live  earth, concerts  
Now  that  Doesn't  mean  that  people  understand  that  global  warming  hurts  the  poorest  and  the  weakest, the  most  
We  visited  every  house  in  india, searching  for  smallpox  --  120  million  houses  once  every  month  for  nearly  two  years.
Thank  you  very  much  
In  the  history  of  our  planet, there  have  been  three  great  waves  of  evolution.
But  we  had  to  do  it  the  hard  way  in  the  old  days  by  choosing  offspring  that  looked  a  particular  way  and  then  breeding  them  
The  scientists  that  made  this  cute  little  creature  ended  up  Slaughtering  it  and  eating  it  afterwards.
A  Cama  is  a  Camel-llama  hybrid, created  to  try  to  get  the  Hardiness  of  a  camel  with  some  of  the  personality  traits  of  a  Llama  
They  did  it  with  puppies  
And  so  some  states  have  decided  to  allow  them.
And  before  you  get  too  worried  about  it  here  in  the  united  states, the  majority  of  food  you  buy  in  the  supermarket  already  has  Genetically-modified  components  to  it.
This  is  Prometea, the  first  cloned  horse  
These  were  the  first  cloned  calves, the  first  cloned  grey  Wolves.
This  is  the  use  of  animals  now  to  create  drugs  and  other  things  in  their  bodies  that  we  want  to  create  
These  are  two  creatures  that  were  created  in  order  to  save  endangered  species.
And  now, using  a  joystick, they  can  send  this  creature  around  the  lab  and  control  whether  it  goes  left  or  right, forwards  or  backwards.
We've  taken  away  the  autonomy  of  this  animal  
And  he  used  that  as  the  it  piece  of  a  mechanism, which  ran  a  flight  simulator, 
I  Don't  know, but  in  fact, it  is  a  fully  living  brain  that  we  have  managed  to  keep  alive  to  do  our  bidding  
This  is  a  mouse  created  by  charles  Vacanti  of  the  university  of  massachusetts  
This  is  what  Frankenstein's  lab  looks  like  
We  are  not  only  already  using  these  things  in  animals, some  of  them  We're  already  beginning  to  use  on  our  own  bodies.
He  was  raised  by  very  supportive  and  interested  parents  
And  the  observations  that  he  made  on  that  epic  journey  were  to  be  eventually  distilled  into  his  wonderful  book  on  the  origin  of  species  published  150  years  ago, 
Now, what  is  so  interesting? And  to  some  the  extent, What's  a  bit  infamous  about  the  origin  of  species  is  that  there  is  only  one  line  in  it  about  human  evolution.
If  only  darwin  had  nasa  
This  has  tremendous  implications  for  our  understanding  of  the  evolution  of  human  skin  pigmentation, 
And  that  skin  pigmentation  itself  was  a  product  of  evolution.
So  living  at  the  equator, we  got  lots  and  lots  of  ultraviolet  radiation  and  the  melanin  --  this  wonderful  complex  ancient  polymer  compound  in  our  skin  --  served  as  a  superb  natural  sunscreen.
Major  moves  outside  of  our  equatorial  homeland  from  africa  into  other  parts  of  the  old  world.
But  It's  all  uva  and  significantly  that  uva  has  no  ability  to  make  vitamin  d  in  your  skin.
Humans  have  been  on  the  move  for  a  long  time.
Here  are  just  some  of  the  biggest  movements  of  people, voluntary  movements  in  the  last  5000  years.
And  not  all  these  moves  were  voluntary  
Evolution  helps  us  
But  we  need  to  think  about  how  he  Compares  in  terms  of  his  pigmentation  to  other  people  on  earth.
They  also  run  the  risk  of  vitamin  d  deficiency  if  they  have  desk  jobs  like  that  guy, 
Darwin, i  think  would  have  appreciated  this, even  though  he  Eschewed  the  importance  of  climate  on  the  evolution  of  pigmentation  during  his  own  life.
Well, the  topic  I'm  going  to  discuss  is  one, which  is  in  a  certain  sense, very  peculiar  because  It's  very  old  
Now, why  do  i  show  a  cauliflower  a  very  ordinary  and  ancient  vegetable  
If  you  try  to  weigh  it  --  of  course, It's  very  easy  to  weigh  it.
If  you  cut  with  a  sharp  knife, one  of  the  Florets  of  a  cauliflower  and  look  at  it, separately, you  think  of  a  whole  cauliflower, but  smaller  
Now, what  did  humanity  do  with  that  
Well, surprisingly, enough  It's  good  in  many  ways, 
It  used  to  be  very  time-consuming, but  now  It's, nothing  
Anatomists  were  arguing  very  much  about  that  
This  cloud  is  completely  100  percent.
And  the  only  part  which  is  natural  is  a  number  the  roughness  of  the  cloud, which  is  taken  from  nature.
Mathematicians  got  into  Self-praise  to  an  extent, which  was  absolutely  amazing  that  man  can  invent  things  that  nature  did  not  know.
In  particular  it  could  invent  things  like  a  curve, which  fills  the  plane  
I  read  the  book  that  mr  eiffel  wrote  about  his  tower.
Then  i  was  telling  my  assistant, i  Don't  see  anything. Can  you  paint?
It  was  very  easy, and  you  can  write  many  books  very  fast  about  it.
In  a  way, It's, the  story  of  my  life  
If  you  could  find  something  new  anything, you  will  get  your  career  made.
It's  so  complicated  
Obviously  from  extraterrestrials  
Thank  you  very  much  
In  1984  in  what  can  only  be  considered  one  of  the  greatest  crimes  of  humanity, nearly  one  million  people  died  of  starvation  in  my  country  of  birth.
Not  because  there  was  not  enough  food  --  because  there  was  actually  a  surplus  of  food  in  the  fertile  regions  of  the  south  parts  of  the  country  --  but  because  in  the  north  people  could  not  access  or  Entitle  themselves  to  that  food  
Most  africans  today, by  far  are  farmers, 
It  also  has  very  high  cost  implications  
Speaking  of  risk  we  have  seen  that  price  volatility  of  food  crops  in  africa  is  the  highest  in  the  world.
In  the  american  midwest  farmers  used  to  load  grain  onto  Barges  and  send  it  Upriver  to  the  chicago  market  
What's  really  important  is  that  the  ecx  will  operate  a  market  information  system  to  disseminate  prices  in  real  time  to  farmers  around  the  country, using  vsat  technology  to  bring  an  electronic  price, dissemination  directly  to  farmers  
And  they  come  to  the  market  knowing  what  grades  their  products  will  achieve  in  terms  of  a  price.
We  believe  that  the  winds  of  change  are  here  and  that  we  can  do  it  
We  believe  that  the  stakes  are  high, but  that  the  returns  will  be  even  greater  
Ethiopia's  agricultural  market  is  30  percent  higher  than  south  Africa's  grain  production. And  in  fact, ethiopia  is  the  second  largest  maize  producer  in  africa.
It's  a  bit  funny  to  be  at  a  conference  dedicated  to  things, not  seen  and  present  my  proposal  to  build  a  6000-kilometer-long  wall  across  the  entire  african  continent, 
The  threat  is  desertification, 
It  is  always  the  same. Never  the  same  endlessly.
One  billion  grains  of  sand  come  into  existence  in  the  world.
Just  south  of  the  sahara, we  find  the  Sahel  
Now, there  is  an  alternative  to  just  planting  trees, and  hoping  that  they  Won't  get  chopped  down.
Inside  of  the  dunes, we  find  shade  
Here  i  am  playing  the  part  of  the  mad  scientist, working  with  the  bugs  at  Ucl  in  london, trying  to  solidify  them  
Well, i  was  inspired  for  my  architectural  form  by  Tafoni, which  look  a  little  bit  like  this. This  is  a  model  representation  of  it.
These  are  Cavernous  rock  structures  that  i  found  on  the  site  in  Sokoto  
That's  not  true  at  all  
So  there  it  is  --  architectural  Anti-desertification  structures  made  from  the  desert  itself.
My  design  as  it  takes  you  down. The  rabbit  hole  is  fraught  with  many  challenges  and  difficulties  in  the  real  world.
Our  goal  is  a  repository  of  published  designs  so  clear.
He  was  talking  about  the  space  aliens, 
I  have  never  built  an  atomic  pile, 
Think  about  it  
I  was  pretty  good  at  the  video  games. I   was  not  very  good  at  the  other  part. So  i  stayed  alone  with  the  cosmos.
Now  you  could  describe  this  as  a  simple  misunderstanding  --  a  strange  encounter  among  humans.
I  went  with  my  friend, tim  Mcgonigal  who  sat  on  my  left  
I  remember, she  had  some  sort  of  injury  to  her  ankle, an  ace  Bandage, and  she  had  crutches  
I  was  starting  high  school  at  the  time. I   would  say  she  was  a  junior, but  i  had  never  seen  her  before. She  Didn't  go  to  my  school.
I  mean, i  liked  him  a  lot  better  than  the  sandworms  
Except  for  the  girl  
And  the  way  i  remember  it  the  movie  featured, these  details, 
But  i  was  exhausted  and  Dog-bitten, and  so  i  said, no  ,
I  realized  that  the  day  would  only  have  two  possible  outcomes  either  catherine  would  come  back  to  the  hotel, or  she  would  never  come  back  to  the  hotel.
But  he  did  not  seem.
I  mean, somebody  pays  you  to  go  around  and  travel  and  look  at  some  of  the  most  beautiful  places  on  the  planet.
We  know  that  hurricanes  have  always  happened  in  the  past  
We  hear  a  lot  about  the  collapse  of  cod  
It's  a  little  hard  to  understand  that  because  you  can  go  to  a  Costco  in  the  united  states  and  buy  cheap  fish, 
The  trophy  fish  were  so  big  that  you  Couldn't  put  any  of  those  small  fish  up  on  it.
And  people  paid  less  in  1950  dollars  to  catch  that  than  what  people  pay  now  to  catch  those  little, tiny  fish  
You  can  see  the  rows  in  the  bottom, the  way  you  can  see  the  rows  in  a  field  that  has  just  been  plowed  to  plant  corn  
It  was  when  i  was  on  holiday  last  early  autumn  in  france  
This  is  from  the  coast  of  brittany, which  is  being  enveloped  in  this  green  algal  slime  
The  governments  of  the  world  are  taking  this  really  seriously  
The  consequence  of  that  is  that  all  those  nutrients  that  fuel, the  great  Anchoveta  fisheries  of  the  Sardines  of  california, or  in  peru, or  whatever  those  slow  down  and  those  fisheries  collapse.
Now, i  Haven't  got  anything  against  efficiency.
In  the  world  i  describe  to  you, we  have  to  be  right  over  here.
So  i  want  to  just  spend  a  couple  of  minutes  on  system  dynamics.
So  it  looks  a  little  bit  like  this  
That's  called  the  circular  flow  of  the  economy.
They  want  to  Hunker  down. They  want  to  look  to  the  future.
Are  we  these  Novelty-seeking  Hedonistic  selfish, individuals, 
It  is  about  allowing  ourselves  the  freedom  to  become  fully  human, recognizing  the  depth  and  the  breadth  of  the  human  psyche  and  building  institutions  to  protect  Rembrandt's, fragile  Altruist  within  
And  We're  going  to  do  it  
We're  just  going  to  click  on  Naturejobsuk  
And  this  too  requires  investment  investment  --  for  example, in  places  --  places  where  we  can  connect  places  where  we  can  participate, shared  spaces, concert  halls  gardens, public  parks, libraries, museums  quiet  centers, places  of  joy  and  celebration  places  of  tranquility  and  contemplation  sites  for  the  Cultivation  of  a  common  citizenship  in  michael  Sandel's, lovely  phrase: 
Chris  anderson: while  They're  taking  the  podium  away, just  a  quick  question, ,
You're  making  news  out  of  the  things  that  tell  you  that  We're  flourishing  
But  it  has  to  have  political  leadership.
The  napalm  is  burning  there.
Oil  Doesn't  sink.
And  the  other  thing  it  does, is  it  spreads  out  the  moment  it  hits  the  water  
It  Triples  the  amount  of  oily, messy  goo  that  you  have  in  the  water, and  it  makes  it  very  hard  to  handle  .
When  the  chemistry  of  the  oil  and  water  also  hits  our  politics  It's, absolutely  explosive  
They  have  a  eureka  moment  when  we  suddenly  understand  oil  in  a  different  context, 
You  might  notice  that  many  gas  pumps, including  this  one  are  designed  to  look  like  atms.
Early  journalists, looked  at  these  spills, and  they  said, this  is  a  filthy  industry.
And  the  thing  about  john  d  is  that  he  went  into  this  chaotic  Wild-east  of  oil  industry, and  he  Rationalized  it  into  a  vertically  integrated  company, a  multinational  
And  then  There's  this  guy, okay, 
So  the  thing  about  water  oil  spills  is  that  they  are  very  politically  Galvanizing  
They  really  influence  people  
Everything  that  we  are  really  Stemmed  from  this  period, 
One  of  the  things  that  happened  with  the  two  previous  oil  spills  was  that  we  really  worked  on  some  of  the  symptoms  
And  these  guys, i  mean, if  they  were  in  the  us, they  might  be  actually  here  in  this  room  
And  then  the  guy  in  the  exxon  uniform  stepped  out  and  we  realized  it  was  okay.
So  what  I'm  going  to  talk  to  you  about  now  is  what  do  we  have  to  do  this  time?
We  need  to  kind  of  get  down  and  do  the  gritty  work  of  reducing  our  dependence  upon  this  fuel.
Cynthia  Schneider, these  programs  are  reaching  incredibly  deeply  into  society.
People  become  so  engaged  that  they  have  volunteers  just  like  political  volunteers.
One  of  them, lima  Sahar  is  a  pashtun  from  Kandahar, a  very  conservative  part  of  the  country.
It  turns  out  that  competition  and  winning  is  a  universal  human  value.
And  then  a  thought  came  across  my  mind, if  things  go  Pear-shaped  on  this  swim, how  long  will  it  take  for  my  frozen  body  to  sink, the  four  and  a  half  kilometers  to  the  bottom  of  the  ocean  
Nearly  two  billion  people  --  so  one  in  three  people  on  this  earth  --  rely  on  the  water  from  the  himalayas.
I  carried  on  for  another  five  or  six  strokes.
It  is  the  most  frightening  and  Panicky  feeling  that  you  can  have  
And  there  we  sat  down  and  we  did  a  Debrief  about  what  had  gone  wrong  there  on  mt.
Take  some  time  to  rest  and  think  about  things  
I  say, i  do  hardware  because  it  sort  of  conveniently  Encompasses  everything  i  do  
So  this  talk  is  going  to  be  about. How  do  we  make  things? And  what  are  the  new  ways  that  We're  going  to  make  things  in  the  future?
And  i  was  laughing  about  this  with  the  very  smart  colleagues, i  have  and  said, you  know, well, if  i  have  to  talk  about  the  future, what  is  it  ?
Literally  think  of  proteins  as  Subroutines  that  you  can  string  together  to  execute  a  program  
And  this  is  being  built  by  a  group  of  students  at  zurich  for  a  design  competition  in  biology, 
Took  me  six  years  at  mit  and  about  that  many  pages  to  describe  what  i  was  doing, and  it  took  him  one  page.
And  the  Ribosome  here  is  another  little  computer  that  helps  in  the  translation  of  the  proteins  
These  are  little  mechanical  computers  
These  are  Five-state  state  machines, 
In  a  neutral  state, they  Won't  bind  at  all  
So  now, I'm  going  to  show  you  the  Hands-free  autonomous  self-replication, 
So  neil  gershenfeld  showed  you  this  video  on  wednesday, i  believe  but  I'll  show  you  again, 
And  how  do  we  think  about  materials  and  structure  sort  of  as  an  information  and  computation  problem?
This  is  a  machine  where  you  literally  define  a  boundary  condition.
We  will  be  an  overwhelmingly  urban  species, 
And  the  correlation, of  course, is  that  denser  places  tend  to  have  lower  emissions  --  which  Isn't, really  all  that  difficult  to  figure  out. If  you  think  about  it.
And  We're  basically  using  mobility  to  get  the  access, we  need  
And  it  is  possible, of  course, to  increase  the  density  of  the  communities  around  us.
Do  they  even  take  the  very  waste  matter  that  we  have  from  food  and  fiber  and  so  forth  and  turn  it  back  into  soil  and  sequester  carbon  --  take  carbon  out  of  the  air  in  the  process  of  using  our  cities  
Because  right  now, our  economy  by  and  large  operates  as  paul  hawken  said, by  stealing  the  future  selling  it  in  the  present  and  calling  it  gdp.
President  clinton  if  You're  here, thank  you  
Well, why  has  violence  declined? No  one  really  knows, but  i  have  read  four  explanations, all  of  which  i  think  have  some  grain  of  plausibility. The  first  is  maybe  thomas. Hobbes, got  it  right? He  was  the  one  who  said  that  life  in  a  state  of  nature  was  solitary  poor  nasty, Brutish  and  short, not  because  he  argued  humans  have  some  primordial  thirst  for  blood  or  aggressive  instinct  or  territorial  imperative. But  because  of  the  logic  of  anarchy  in  a  state  of  anarchy  There's, a  constant  temptation  to  invade  your  neighbors, Preemptively  before  they  invade  you  more  recently, thomas  schelling  gives  the  analogy  of  a  Homeowner  who  hears  a  rustling  in  the  basement  being  a  good  american.
It  removes  the  need  for  a  hair  trigger  for  Retaliation  to  make  your  Deterrent  threat  credible. And  therefore  it  would  lead  to  a  state  of  peace  eisner  --  the  man  who  plotted  the  homicide  rates  that  you  failed  to  see  in  the  earlier  slide  --  argued  that  the  timing  of  the  decline  of  homicide  in  europe, coincided  with  the  rise  of  centralized  states.
This  was  an  argument  from  the  political  scientist, james  Payne, 
Because  we  have  been  doing  something  right, and  it  sure  would  be  good  to  find  out  what  it  is.
We  learned  it  in  college  
We  have  liberia, we  have  congo  
Income  per  person. I   can  put  that  here.
That's  why  we  are  so  scared  about  flu  Isn't, it  
And  especially  It's  interesting  to  see  china  and  the  united  states  during  200  years, because  i  have  my  oldest  son  now, working  for  google  after  google  acquired  this  software  
Mao  tse-tung  eventually  brought  health  to  china, and  then  he  died, and  then  deng  xiaoping  started  this  amazing  move  forward.
And  i  come  now  into  projections, but  i  have  to  stop  at  the  door  of  lehman  brothers  there, you  know  because  --  That's  where  the  projections  are  not  valid  any  longer  
East  europe, latin  america  and  oecd  countries.
It's  lincoln  here, advancing  them  
And  we  have  countries  all  this  way.
And  what  has  happened  in  the  world  
We  used  to  boast  about  fast  social  progress, 
That's  where  we  were  1900  
And  you  can  see  It's, not  that  easy  that  it  is  war, which  caused  this  
And  here  in  zambia, there  is  peace.
If  i  split  tanzania  in  its  income, the  richer  20  percent  in  tanzania  has  more  hiv  than  the  poorest.
And  It's  really  different  within  each  country.
It's  similar  to  the  Pellagra  epidemic  in  mississippi  in  the  '30s  
We  have  seen  it  here  in  mozambique, 
That  used  to  be  the  illegal  diamond  trade  from  the  Unita-dominated  area.
Don't, get  confused  of  the  progress  of  the  emerging  economies  and  the  great  capacity  of  people  in  the  middle  income  countries  and  in  peaceful  low  income  countries  
I  am  a  reformed  marketer, and  i  now  work  in  international  development  
He  said, There's, just  not  in  demand  
And  as  a  marketer, i  found  that  curious  
And  it  turns  out  that  there  are  three  main  messages  used  by  the  donor  agencies  for  these  condoms.
They  package  it  with  the  red  ribbon  that  reminds  us  of  hiv, put  it  in  boxes  that  remind  you  who  paid  for  them  show  pictures  of  your  wife  or  husband  and  tell  you  to  protect  them  or  to  act  Prudently  
And  so  the  lesson  is  this: it  Doesn't  really  matter  what  You're  selling  you  just  have  to  think  about  who  is  your  customer. And  what  are  the  messages  that  are  going  to  get  them  to  change  their  behavior?
It  was  before  the  avian  flu  had  reached  europe  
I'll  see  what  i  can  do, ok, 
Generations  go  by  somebody  says, hey, why  Don't?
Just  absolutely  delights, the  little  ones  
Point  is  There's, obviously  collaboration  and  organization  going  on  beyond  national  bounds.
A  lot  of  forms  of  non-zero-sum  behavior  in  the  realm  of  economics.
Now, this  sounds  like  an  intrinsically  upbeat  worldview  in  a  way, because  when  you  think  of  Non-zero, you  think  win-win, you  know, That's  good.
I  have  a  whole  global  governance  sermon  that  i  will  spare  you  right  now, because  i  Don't  think  That's  going  to  be  enough  anyway, although  It's  essential  
That  is  to  say  --  --  thank  you. Thank  you. That  is  to  say, remember  my  whole  view  of  morality  is  that  it  boils  down  to  self-interest.
Doing  the  best  i  can  ok, 
It  was  kind  of  along  these  lines.
And  a  kind  of  saving  higher  moral  level, something  that  kind  of  literally  saves  the  world  
Yahweh  is  our  savior  means. He  has  saved  the  nation  of  israel, which  at  the  time  was  a  pretty  high-level  social  organization.
I  am  very, very  happy  to  be  amidst  some  of  the  most  --  the  lights  are  really  disturbing  my  eyes  and  They're  reflecting  on  my  glasses  
Because  despair  civil  war  hunger  and  famine, although  They're  part  and  Parcel  of  our  african  reality, they  are  not  the  only  reality  
But  they  also  succeed  at  the  job  of  entrepreneurship, 
Support, private  investment  in  africa, both  domestic  and  foreign  
Which  country  is  that  
The  productive  margin  in  our  Governments'  search  for  revenue, does  not  lie  in  the  domestic  economy. It  lies  with  international  donors.
The  imf, the  world  bank  and  the  Cartel  of  good  intentions  in  the  world  has  taken  over  our  rights  as  citizens, and  therefore  what  our  governments  are  doing  because  they  depend  on  aid  is  to  listen  to  international  Creditors, rather  than  their  own  citizens.
They  talk  to  international  donors, 
Where  has  all  the  aid  gone  
Uganda's  recurrent  expenditure  --  by  recurrent  what  do  i  mean  
The  editor  of  discover  told  us  10  of  them  I'm  going  to  give  you  the  eleventh  
So  they  came  to  me  --  cnn  --  and  they  said, professor  seligman, would  you  tell  us  about  the  state  of  psychology  today?
Look  doctor  seligman, we  can  see  You're, really  not  comfortable  in  this  medium.
Not  good  enough  and  That's  what  I'm  going  to  be  talking  about  
It  should  be  just  as  concerned  with  building  strength  as  with  repairing  damage.
And  starting  about  six  years  ago, we  asked  about  extremely  happy.
That's, what  aristotle  was  talking  about  
The  first  life  is  the  pleasant  life  and  It's  simply  as  best  we  can  find  it  It's  having  as  many  of  the  pleasures, as  you  can  as  much  positive  emotion, as  you  can  and  learning  the  skills  --  savoring  mindfulness  --  that  amplify  them  that  stretch  them  over  time  and  space  
In  two  of  the  three  great  arenas  of  life  by  the  time, len  was  30, len  was  enormously  successful. The  first  arena  was  work.
It  turned  out  that  --  len  grew  up  in  long  island, and  he  played  football  and  watched  football  and  played  bridge  --  len  is  in  the  bottom  five  percent  of  what  we  call  positive  Affectivities  
When  he  walks  onto  the  floor  of  the  american  exchange  at  930  in  the  morning, time  stops  for  him, and  it  stops  till  the  closing  bell  
And  we  think  There's  a  recipe  for  it  and  It's  knowing  what  your  highest  strengths  are  
Just  one  example, one  person  i  worked  with  was  a  Bagger  at  Genuardi's  
Her  highest  strength  was  social  intelligence.
Now, obviously  she  failed  
What  you  get  out  of  that  is  not  Smiley-ness  
I'd, like  you  to  remember  someone  who  did  something  enormously  important  that  changed  your  life  in  a  good  direction, and  who  you  never  properly  thanked  
I  hope  all  of  you  have  such  a  person  
But  they  were  empty  
And  so  the  parallel  thing  holds  with  technology, entertainment  and  design.
So  in  conclusion, the  eleventh  reason  for  optimism. In  addition  to  the  space  elevator  is  that  i  think  with  technology, entertainment  and  design, we  can  actually  increase  the  amount  of  Tonnage  of  human  happiness  on  the  planet.
And  if  technology  can  in  the  next  decade  or  two  increase  the  pleasant  life, the  good  life  and  the  meaningful  life, it  will  be  good  enough.
Here's, an  example, 
Four  years  ago, i  was  at  the  beach  with  my  son, and  he  was  learning  how  to  swim  in  this  relatively  soft  surf  of  the  Delaware  beaches.
So  this  represents  --  this  is  a  Cross-sample  of  some  remarkable  images  taken  by  some  of  the  World's, greatest  Photojournalists  working  at  the  very  top  of  their  craft  --  except  one  
But  to  be  a  great  Photojournalist, you  have  to  have  more  than  just  one  or  two  great  photographs  in  you  
But  the  centerpiece  species  of  Zakouma  are  the  elephants  
And  instead  created  a  story  that  touched  our  audiences, deeply  
Instead  of  just  knowledge  of  this  park, he  created  an  understanding  and  an  empathy  for  the  elephants, the  rangers  and  the  many  issues  surrounding  Human-wildlife  conflicts, 
He  saw  that  this  was  a  living  and  breathing  and  vital  part  of  how  the  entire  urban  area  Functioned  
We  also  want  to  look  for  solutions.
Jim  took  what  could  have  been  a  straight-up  medical  science  story  and  gave  it  a  human  dimension  that  touched  our  readers, deeply  
But  there  are  also  times  when  photographers  simply  encounter  things  that  are  when  it  comes  down  to  it  just  plain  fun  
Thank  you  
And  my  father  was  a  soldier.
For  three  times, i  applied  to  biomedical  science  to  be  a  doctor  
With  the  end  of  the  dictatorship  regime  of  mobutu, Sese  Seko  that  most  of  you  know, life  became  very, very  difficult  
So  they  started  fleeing  from  the  east  to  the  west  
All  my  friends  said, we  are  leaving  because  we  are  a  target  
But  I'm  not  going  to  the  east, because  i  Don't  know, swahili  
Because  He's  pygmy, he  knows  how  to  track  elephants  in  the  forest  
They  came  to  told  me, i  have  to  save  him  
Everywhere, there  has  been  constant  extraction  of  mineral  killing  animals, the  logging  Timbers  and  so  on  
That  is  coltan  extraction, gold, mining, 
We  have  to  do  it  because  to  let  our  movement  advance  
After  a  week, we  celebrated  the  birthday  of  that  okapi, they  killed  an  elephant, just  50  meters  to  the  area  where  the  zoo  where  okapi  was  born  
I  devoted  half  of  it  to  rebuild  the  herbarium  because  we  Didn't  have  good  infrastructure  to  start  plants.
But  is  gun  industries  a  tool  to  rebuild, or  is  it  a  game  
And  they  Can't  go  even  to  university  
Thank  you.
One  of  the  biggest  challenges  in  computer  graphics  has  been  being  able  to  create  a  photo-real  digital  human  face.
And  one  of  the  reasons  it  is  so  difficult  is  that  unlike  aliens  and  dinosaurs, we  look  at  human  faces  every  day  
We  shoot  all  of  these  photographs  in  about  three  seconds, 
If  we  zoom  in  on  this  photograph, right  here  we  can  see  It's  a  really  nice  photograph  to  have  of  her, because  she  is  lit  from  absolutely  everywhere  at  the  same  time  to  get  a  nice  image  of  her  facial  texture  
We're  just  seeing  the  coarse-scale  geometry  here, 
And  thank  you  very  much  
We're, roughly  two  days  from  the  entrance  at  that  point  
Otherwise  it  is  completely  dark  in  these  places.
Next  year  I'll  be  leading  an  international  team  to  J2  
This  is  one  of  the  places  where  planetary  scientists  believe  there  is  a  highest  probability  of  the  detection  of  the  first  life  off  earth  in  the  ocean  that  exists  below  there.
It's  basically  a  Nuclear-heated  torpedo  ,
One  is, how  do  you  do  science?
How  do  you  take  a  robot  and  turn  it  into  a  field?
If  it  passes  the  microscopic  test, we  go  for  a  collection  
No  hands  at  the  wheel  
This  is  all  behavioral  autonomy  here.
That's  more  than  you  pay  for  ted  if  google  dropped  their  Sponsorship  
There  is  a  place  where  you  can  
If  We're  going  to  get  that  and  make  that  gas  station  possible, we  have  to  figure  out  ways  to  move  large  volumes  of  payload  through  space.
It  has  never  been  done  
I  like  this  equipment, you  know, and  i  really  value  it  so  We're  not  going  to  burn  the  gear.
And  I'm  Gonna  try  and  do  that  within  the  18-minute  time  span  that  we  were  told  to  stay  within  and  to  follow  the  ted  commandments, that  is  actually  something  that  creates  a  near-death  experience. But  near-death  is  good  for  creativity.
I  think  that  part  of  it  also  begins  with  a  sense  of  identity  crisis, you  know, who  am  i? Why  am  i  this  particular  person? Why  am  i  not  black  like  everybody  else?
I  used  to  draw.
And  when  you  are  faced  with  the  prospect  of  death, very  soon, you  begin  to  think  very  much  about  everything  
So  in  quantum  mechanics, of  course, you  have  dark  energy  and  dark  matter.
And  That's, what  i  look  for  in  my  work, a  personal  meaning  
And  they  also  have  to  make  a  living  and  people  need  to  be  fed  
It  may  be  something  that  is  perhaps  more  serious  --  as  i  said, human  rights  in  burma  
This  leads  to  this  question: ,
In  this  case, i  was  writing  a  story  that  included  some  kind  of  detail  period  of  history, a  certain  location  
Especially  when  good  things  happen, and  in  particular, when  bad  things  happen, 
But  i  do  think  There's  a  kind  of  serendipity, and  i  do  want  to  know  what  those  elements  are. So  i  can  thank  them. And  also  try  to  find  them  in  my  life.
Is  it  because  i  had  the  filter  that  i  have  such  a  strong  coincidence  in  writing  about  these  things.
It  takes  a  while, but  i  have  to  let  go  of  them  and  just  go  there  and  be  there.
And  the  reason  is  that, until  wonder  came  along  and  figured  out  how  to  spread  the  idea  of  sliced  bread.
And  when  i  talk  about  it, i  usually  pick  business  because  they  make  the  best  pictures  that  you  can  put  in  your  presentation.
Well, this  tv-industrial  complex  informed  my  entire  childhood, and  probably  yours  
And  i  ignored  every  message  because  i  Don't  have  a  pain  Reliever  problem: 
I  buy  the  stuff  in  the  yellow  box, because  i  always  have  
Consumers  Don't  care  about  you  at  all, they  just  Don't  care.
Because  people  saw  it  and  said  --  i  Didn't  know  that  was  there  --  and  they  noticed  it  
And  the  thing  is  people  in  the  fashion  business  know  what  It's  like  to  be  in  the  fashion  business  --  They're  used  to  it  
The  rest  of  us  have  to  figure  out  how  to  think  that  way  
How  to  understand  that  It's  not  about  interrupting  people  with  big  Full-page  ads  or  insisting  on  meetings  with  people  
He  lived  in  paris  last  year, he  sold  10  million  Dollars'  worth  of  french  bread  
It  was  neat, it  was  remarkable.
They  would  ignore  the  geeks, and  god  forbid  the  Laggards  
To  make  a  product  to  market  an  idea  to  come  up  with  any  problem. You  want  to  solve  that.
Krispy  Kreme  has  a  strategy. And  what  they  do  is  they  enter  a  city. They  talk  to  the  people  with  otaku, and  then  they  spread  through  the  city  to  the  people.
They're  made  from  Cremains  
Oh  you  like  my  ring  It's, my  grandmother, 
Fastest-growing  business  in  the  whole  Mortuary  industry, 
The  first  one  is  design  is  free  when  you  get  to  scale  
And  the  people  who  come  up  with  stuff, That's  remarkable  more  often  than  not  figure  out  how  to  put  design  to  work  for  them.
Silk, put  a  product  that  does  not  need  to  be  in  the  refrigerated  section. Next  to  the  milk  in  the  refrigerated  section.
For  the  people  who  were  there  and  looking  at  that  section, it  was  remarkable  .
And  i  wanted  to  tell  stories  about  all  the  amazing  things  i  was  seeing  underwater, incredible  wildlife  and  interesting  behaviors  
And  the  ice  that  is  there  is  quite  thin  
These  are  the  tuna, the  Billfish  and  the  sharks  
But  the  truth  is  We're  way  too  efficient  at  catching  them, and  their  stocks  have  collapsed  worldwide  
So  this  is  the  true  cost  of  a  shrimp  dinner, maybe  seven  or  eight  shrimp  and  10  pounds  of  other  animals  that  had  to  die  in  the  process.
I  also  wanted  to  focus  on  the  shark  fishing  industry  because  currently  on  planet  earth  We're  killing  over  100  million  sharks  every  single  year  
But  before  i  went  out  to  photograph, this  component, i  sort  of  Wrestled  with  the  notion  of  how  do  you  make  a  picture  of  a  dead  shark  that  will  resonate  with  readers?
One  of  the  locations  was  this  place  called  tiger  beach  in  the  northern  bahamas, where  tiger  sharks  aggregate  in  shallow  water, 
I  also  searched  on  this  story  for  the  elusive, great  Hammerhead, an  animal  that  really  Hadn't  been  photographed  much  until  maybe  about  seven  or  10  years  ago.
But  this  is  crucial  habitat  and  It's  where  they  spend  the  first  two  three  years  of  their  lives  until  They're  big  enough  to  go  out  on  the  rest  of  the  reef.
I  actually  jumped  in  and  photographed  this. And  with  the  Fisherman's  permission, i  cut  the  turtle  out, and  it  was  able  to  swim  free  .
But  you  know, thousands  of  other  leatherbacks, each  year  are  not  so  fortunate. And  the  Species'  future  is  in  great  danger.
You  can  see  the  coal  burning  plant  in  the  background, 
I  went  down  there  in  the  winter  time, 
And  these  are  animals  that  had  never  seen  humans  before.
For  example, they  hoped  that  certain  species  of  fish  like  the  new  zealand  Snapper  would  return  because  they  had  been  fished  to  the  brink  of  commercial  extinction.
But  when  the  fish  came  back  and  began  Predating  and  controlling  the  urchin  population  low  and  behold, kelp  forests  emerged  in  shallow  water, 
And  That's  because  the  urchins  eat  kelp  
Little  blue  cod  swimming  in  for  a  dash  of  color  
The  ocean  is  indeed  resilient  and  tolerant  to  a  point, but  we  must  be  good.
But  I'm  moving  past  malthus, because  i  think  that  we  just  might  be  about  150  years  from  a  kind  of  new  enlightenment.
And  the  World's  population  expected  to  top  out  at  something, hopefully  a  bit  less  than  10  billion  late  this  century.

Fear  for  the  future  leads  to  some  rash  decisions.
I  was  walking  in  the  market  one  day  with  my  wife, and  somebody  stuck  a  cage  in  my  face.
So  We're  in  east  borneo.
What  we  did  was  we  formulated  recipes  --  how  to  go  from  a  starting  situation  where  you  have  nothing  to  a  target  situation, 
And  once  the  soil  gets  dried  You're  in  a  dry  season  --  you  get  cracks  oxygen  goes  in  flames, come  out. And  the  problem  starts  all  over  again.
This  is  what  it  looked  like  for  three  months.
We  lost  all  the  crops, no  children  gained  weight  for  over  a  year. They  lost  12  iq  points.
That  was  why  i  put  it  as  a  single  point  up  there.
You  need  the  bacteria  to  fix  nitrogen.
And  we  have  monitored  every  single  one  of  those  trees  from  space  
In  the  beginning, maybe  Pineapples  and  beans  and  corn  in  the  second  phase  there  will  be  bananas  and  Papayas  later  on  there  will  be  chocolate  and  Chilies

In  north  Sulawesi, it  is  the  cooperative  --  they  have  a  democratic  culture  there. So  there  you  can  use  the  local  justice  system  to  protect  your  system.
They  can  now  sell  part  of  those  fruits  to  the  orangutan  project, 
Now, i  think  the  real  key  to  doing  it  to  give  a  simple  answer  is  integration  
There's, no  matter  of  scale, It's  not  a  question  of  scale, It's, not  a  question  of  financial  resources,

He  said, this  in  december  1862  to  the  second  annual  meeting  of  congress  
I  ought  to  explain  that  i  have  no  idea  what  was  happening  at  the  time.
So  no  doubt  something  fascinating  was  happening  in  december  1862, which  the  americans  among  us  will  be  aware  of  
You  know  what  it  means  
But  our  minds  are  still  Hypnotized  by  them, and  we  have  to  Disenthrall  ourselves  of  some  of  them.

According  to  paul  and  anne  ehrlich  and  a  well-known  environmental  impact  equation, impact  --  a  bad  thing  --  is  the  product  of  population  affluence  and  technology  
Paul  and  anne  Ehrlich's  environmental  impact  equation. I   is  equal  to  p  times  a  times.
And  i  Reasoned  that  if  we  could  make  those  transformative  changes  and  get  rid  of  T1  altogether, we  could  reduce  our  impact  to  zero, including  our  impact  on  the  climate  .
Fossil  fuel  usage  is  down  60  percent  per  unit  of  production  due  to  efficiencies  in  renewables.
Down  40  percent  in  our  Broadloom  carpet  business, which  we  acquired  in  1993  right  here  in  california  city  of  industry  where  water  is  so  precious  
We  have  diverted  148  million  pounds  --  That's, 74000  tons  --  of  used  carpet  from  landfills  closing  the  loop  on  material  flows  through  reverse  logistics  and  Post-consumer.
Costs  products  people  marketplaces  --  what  else  is  there?
But  the  marketplace  was  down  36  percent  
We  can  see  our  way  now  clear  to  the  top  of  that  mountain  
Who  is  that  person?
And  We're  all  Acutely  aware, What's  it  going  to  mean  in  the  future.
The  arts  reformation  like  the  religious  reformation  is  Spurred  in  part  by  technology  with  indeed, the  printing  press, really  leading  the  charge  on  the  religious  reformation.
This  group  others  have  called  the  pro  Ams, amateur  artists, doing  work  at  a  professional  level.
But  i  want  to  be  clear, just  as  the  religious  reformation  did  not  spell  the  end  to  the  formal  church  or  to  the  priesthood. I   believe  that  our  artistic  institutions  will  continue  to  have  importance.
And  indeed, i  think  rather  than  being  annihilated  the  performing  arts  are  posed  on  the  brink  of  a  time  when  we  will  be  more  important  than  we  have  ever  been  
I  salute  all  of  you  as  activists  in  that  quest  and  urge  you  to  embrace  and  hold  dear  the  arts  in  your  work, whatever  your  purpose  may  be  
Thank  you  
Manchester. Craftsmen's  guild  is  named  after  my  neighborhood.
Built  in  a  tough  neighborhood, where  people  have  been  given  up  for  dead  
My  view  is  that  if  you  want  to  involve  yourself  in  the  life  of  people  who  have  been  given  up  on, you  have  to  look  like  the  solution  and  not  the  problem  
And  now  that  I'm  giving  speeches  at  conferences  like  ted, i  got  put  on  the  board  of  the  carnegie  museum.
Well, i  think  that  welfare  mothers  and  At-risk  kids  and  ex-steel  workers  deserve  a  fountain  in  their  life.
And  he  called  me  into  his  office  --  which  is  the  equivalent  of  going  to  see  the  wizard  of  oz  --  and  john  heinz  had  600  million  dollars.
So  at  my  school, we  subsidize  a  gourmet  lunch  program  for  welfare  mothers  in  the  middle  of  the  inner  city  because  We've  discovered  that  It's  good  for  their  stomachs, but  It's  better  for  their  heads.
I've  actually  eaten  seven  of  those  baskets  and  They're  very  good  
Remember  I'm  the  black  kid  from  the  '60s  who  got  his  life  saved  with  ceramics.
Let  me  show  you  what  these  people  do.
We  have  a  world  class  gallery  because  we  believe  that  poor  kids  need  a  world  class  gallery.
So  he  jumped  in  the  van, he  went  to  miss  Jones'  house  and  said, miss  jones. I   knew  you  wanted  to  come  to  your  Kid's  art  opening, but  you  probably  Didn't  have  a  ride.
And  there  is  no  statistical  difference  between  the  white  parents  and  the  black  parents  
She  said, well, i  work  for  a  company  called  hewlett-packard  
And  i  said, well, There's  an  easy  solution  to  that  problem.
He  said, because  i  heard  you  built  the  center, and  i  Didn't  believe  that  you  did  it.
Well  we  did  win.
And  that  was  our  first  recording  studio, which  was  the  broom  closet  
And  this  is  what  i  want  to  do  when  i  grow  up  
This  is  in  a  place  called  san  francisco, 
And  i  said, herbie, this  is  my  concept  of  a  training  center  for  poor  people.
And  now  i  really  want  to  build  one  
And  i  promised  these  people  that  i  was  going  to  build  this  thing  and  We're  going  to  build  it  all  right  
And  i  said, if  i  can  follow  that  music  I'll  get  out  into  the  sunlight  and  I'll  be  ok, 
And  i  Don't  think  I'm  crazy  
So  10  times  more  bacterial  cells  than  human  cells  on  a  human  being  
At  the  best  You're  10  percent  human, but  more  likely  about  one  percent  human, depending  on  which  of  these  metrics  you  like  
And  so  we  wanted  to  think  if  there  Couldn't  be  a  different  way  that  bacteria  live  
What  You're  looking  at  on  this  slide  is  just  a  person  from  my  lab, holding  a  Flask  of  a  liquid  culture  of  a  bacterium, a  harmless  beautiful  bacterium  that  comes  from  the  ocean  named  vibrio  fischeri  
We  just  took  the  picture  by  turning  the  lights  off  in  the  room.
But  when  they  grew  to  a  certain  cell  number  all  the  bacteria  turned  on  light  simultaneously, 
The  question  that  we  had  is  how  can  bacteria  these  primitive  organisms  tell  the  difference  from  times  when  They're  alone  and  times  when  They're  in  a  community, and  then  all  do  something  together  
This  is  like  the  stealth  bomber  of  the  ocean  
And  then, as  the  cells  grow  They're, all  releasing  that  molecule  into  the  environment, so  There's, lots  of  molecule, there  
But  the  one  That's, probably  the  most  important  to  you  is  virulence.
This  is  the  vibrio  fischeri  molecule, 
So  then  we  started  to  look  at  other  bacteria, and  these  are  just  a  Smattering  of  the  molecules  that  We've  discovered  
The  left-hand  part  of  the  molecule  is  identical  in  every  single  species  of  bacteria  
What  that  does  is  to  Confer, exquisite  species  Specificities  to  these  languages.
Each  molecule  fits  into  its  partner  receptor  and  no  other  
Each  bacteria  uses  a  particular  molecule, That's  its  language  that  allows  it  to  count  its  own  siblings.
Anywhere  on  your  body, it  looks  pretty  much  like  this.
Couldn't  these  be  new  kinds  of  antibiotics  
And  so  now, of  course, we  have  this  global  problem  in  infectious  diseases, 
The  first  one  is  We've  targeted  the  Intraspecies  communication  system.
I  hope  that  what  You've  learned  is  that  bacteria  can  distinguish  self  from  other  
This  is  exactly  what  happens  in  your  body  
But  then  to  finish  with  a  plug  for  all  the  good  and  miraculous  bacteria  that  live  on  the  earth, We've  also  made  Pro-quorum  sensing  molecules, 
Remember  you  have  these  10  times  or  more  bacterial  cells  in  you  or  on  you  keeping  you  healthy  
So  I'm, really  a  basic  scientist, not  a  Clinician, but  in  the  last  year  and  a  half  I've  started  to  switch  over  to  use  what  We've  been  learning  about  these  patterns  of  activity  to  develop  prosthetic  devices.
It's, really  our  first  Foray  into  this  
Like  this  pattern  of  pulses, here  actually  means  Baby's  face. And  so  when  the  brain  gets  this  pattern  of  pulses, it  knows  that  what  was  out  there  was  a  Baby's  face. And  if  it  got  a  different  pattern, it  would  know  that  what  was  out. There  was  say  a  dog  or  another  pattern  would  be  a  house.
So  this  is  what  We've  been  working  on.
So  a  completely  blind  retina, even  one  with  no  front-end  circuitry  at  all, no  photoreceptors  can  now  send  out  normal  signals  signals  that  the  brain  can  understand  
And  so  with  the  standard  method, the  cells  do  fire, they  just  Don't  fire  in  the  normal  firing  patterns  because  they  Don't  have  the  right  code.
This  is  just  actually  the  first  one  that  we  tried  
So  It's  different  from  the  motor  prosthetics, where  You're  communicating  from  the  brain  to  a  device  here  we  have  to  communicate  from  the  outside  world  into  the  brain  and  be  understood  and  be  understood  by  the  brain.
You  can  just  call  it  out.
Who  else  
The  worst  flute  players  
Actually  that  was  Aristotle's  answer, too  
Peter  the  greatest  benefit  to  all  
The  greatest  benefit  to  all  
All  right  
Aristotle  had  a  different  reason  for  saying, the  best  flutes  should  go  to  the  best  flute  players.
And  the  point  the  essential  nature  of  musical  performance  is  to  produce  excellent  music.
Suppose  you  were  on  the  supreme  court  
Suppose  you  were  deciding  the  justice  of  this  case, 
Raise  your  hand  and  We'll  try  to  get  you  a  microphone.
That's  part  of  the  game  of  golf  
Charlie, what  do  you  say  to  warren  
Warren  i  am  not  a  golfer  
He  Wouldn't  have  granted  the  cart, and  he  had  a  very  interesting  dissent.
But  since  it  is  the  very  nature  of  a  game  to  have  no  object  except  amusement, that  is  what  distinguishes  games  from  productive  activity.
First, no, real  sports  fan  would  talk  that  way.
On  the  face  of  it, it  seemed  to  be  --  this  debate  about  the  golf  cart  --  an  argument  about  fairness, What's  an  unfair  advantage  
So  if  golfing  is  the  kind  of  game  that  can  be  played  while  riding  around  in  a  golf  cart, it  would  be  hard  to  Confer  on  the  golfing  greats  the  status  that  we  Confer  the  honor  and  recognition  that  goes  to  truly  great  athletes, 
How  many  here  favor?
I'm  going  to  talk  about  why  we  have  to  get  our  shit  together  and  actually  talk  about  this  a  bit  more  than  we  do.
That  was  easy, ok, .
Ok, hands  up  anyone  in  the  audience: Who's, not  sure  whether  malaria  is  a  good  thing  or  a  bad  thing.
You  know, a  lot  of  people  said, well, you  know  city, boys  have  no  business  telling  us  rural  types. What  to  do  with  our  time?
It's  a  global  trance, 
But  the  question  is, are  they  so  dangerous  --  these  risks  of  doing  something  about  aging  --  that  they  outweigh  the  downside  of  doing  the  opposite?
People  worry  about  Overpopulation, they  say, well, if  we  fix  aging, no  One's  going  to  die  to  speak  of, or  at  least  the  death  toll  is  going  to  be  much  lower  only  from  crossing  st  Giles  Carelessly  
This  Pro-aging  trance  is  what  stops  us  from  agitating  about  these  things.
But  it  Isn't  
So  these  trajectories  here  are  basically  how  we  would  expect  people  to  live  in  terms  of  remaining  life  expectancy  as  measured  by  their  health  for  given  ages  that  they  were  at  the  time  that  these  therapies  arrive  
But  if  You're  only  50  then  There's  a  chance  that  you  might  be  able  to  pull  out  of  the  dive, and  you  know  --  --  eventually  get  through  this  and  start  becoming  biologically  younger  in  a  meaningful  sense, in  terms  of  your  Youthfulness, both  physical  and  mental.
And  of  course, if  You're  a  bit  younger  than  that, then  You're  never  really  even  going  to  get  near  to  being  fragile  enough  to  die  of  age-related  causes  
And  That's  quite  a  thought, 
So  in  other  words, we  add  two  years  --  we  Treble  their  remaining  lifespan, starting  from  the  point  that  we  started  the  therapies  
So  We're  likely  to  end  up  with  a  very  strong  change  in  People's  attitudes.
Because  the  critical  thing  about  this  is  that  even  though  the  damage  only  eventually  causes  pathology, the  damage  itself  is  caused  Ongoing-ly  throughout  life, starting  before  We're, born  
And  the  reason  It's  a  losing  battle  is  because  the  damage  is  continuing  to  accumulate  
So  these  seven  things  were  all  under  discussion  in  gerontology  a  long  time  ago, and  that  is  pretty  good  news, because  it  means  that  you  know, We've  come  a  long  way  in  biology  in  these  20  years. So  the  fact  that  we  Haven't  extended  this  list  is  a  pretty  good  indication  that  There's, no  extension  to  be  done.
And  you  know  what  happened  
But  i  mean, look  --  how  long  does  it  take  to  spend  that  on  the  war  in  iraq?
And  i  think  we  know  how  to  do  it  and  I'll  stop  there  
Audience  species  on  this  planet  have  evolved  with  immune  systems  to  fight  off  all  the  diseases.
If  i  project  that  that  would  make  me  think  that  i  would  live  until  120, if  i  Don't  crash  on  my  motorbike  
Ninety-nine  Pence  was  the  starting  price  and  no  reserve  
Then  there  was  the  volcano  that  interrupted  the  travel  plans  of  almost  all  of  you  and  many  of  your  friends, including  president  obama  ,
I'm  here  to  tell  you  the  story  of  Audur  capital, which  is  a  financial  firm  founded  by  me  and  Kristin  --  who  you  see  in  the  picture  --  in  the  spring  of  2007, just  over  a  year  before  the  economic  collapse, hit  
And  we  believe  that  doing  emotional  due  Diligence  is  just  as  important  as  doing  financial  due  Diligence  
So  we  like  to  see  profits, plus  positive  social  and  environmental  benefits, when  we  invest  
Now  that  We've  had  all  that  happen, and  we  have  all  this  data  out  there  telling  us  that  It's  much  better  to  have  diversity  around  the  decision-making  tables. Will  we  see  business  and  finance  change?
I  want  to  see  more  revolutionary  thinking, and  i  remain  hopeful  
For  me, it  was  the  start  of  a  long  journey.
External  debt  --  something  that  i  can  tell  you  a  long  story  about  because  i  personally  worked  on  one  of  the  biggest  Debts  on  the  continent  --  has  come  down  dramatically.
Because  we  are  confronted  with  a  challenge  
We  need  to  bring  it  back  to  say, what  is  the  combination  of  all  these  factors  that  is  going  to  yield  what  we  want  
And  i  want  to  tell  you  something  
The  issue  is  not  that  
She  was  three  years  old, and  i  was  15  
Now, i  put  my  sister  on  my  back  --  burning  --  and  i  walked  10  kilometers  with  her  strapped  on  my  back  
In  about  two  to  three  hours, she  started  to  move  
You  know, we  have  to  use  it.
For  which  many  people, even  from  other  parts  of  the  world  are  going  there  to  find  jobs  
They  are  just  discovering  
Let's, sit  down  and  really  tell  you  where  the  money  should  be  channeled, and  where  this  aid  should  go.
How  can  we  get  government  to  combine  properly  with  these  private  foundations  with  the  international  organizations  and  with  our  private  sector, 
Aid  Cannot  solve  our  problems.
In  fact, the  chinese  minister  of  finance  said  to  me  when  i  asked  him, what  are  we  doing  wrong  in  nigeria?
Infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure  and  discipline  
And  i  repeat  it  for  the  continent  
And  lastly, what  are  you  going  to  do  to  be  part  of  this  partnership  of  aid  government, private  sector  and  the  african  as  an  individual  
I  will  say, though  that  after  having  done  surgery, a  lot  It's  somewhat  similar  to  playing  a  musical  instrument, 
And  I'll  tell  you  that  most  scientific  studies  of  music  They're  very  dense.
That  blood  flow  causes  an  increase  in  local  blood  to  that  area  with  a  Deoxyhemoglobin  change  in  concentration.
Charles  limb: this  is  a  plastic  midi  piano  keyboard  that  we  use  for  the  jazz  experiments.
And  so  what  we  did  was  we  brought  professional  jazz  players  to  the  nih, and  we  had  them  memorize  this  piece  of  music  on  the  left, the  Lower-left  --  which  is  what  you  heard  me  playing  --  and  then  we  had  them  improvise  to  the  same  exact  chord  changes.
And  I've  listened  to  that  solo  200  times, and  i  still  like  it  
And  so  we  had  this  focal  area  called  the  Medial  prefrontal  cortex  that  went  way  up  in  activity.
We  had  this  broad  patch  of  area  called  the  lateral  prefrontal  cortex  that  went  way  down  in  activity  and  I'll  summarize  that  for  you  here, 
Now, these  are  Multifunctional  areas  of  the  brain  
The  fact  that  we  do  it  over  and  over  again, lets  you  Acclimate  to  your  surroundings, 
So, how  do  you  study  rap  scientifically  
With  this  big  screen, you  can  all  rap  with  me.
He's  just  memorized  a  rhyme  for  us.
And  what  we  see  we  do  see  language  areas  lighting  up.
You  have  heightened  brain  activity  when  You're  doing  a  comparable  task  when  that  one  task  is  creative. And  the  other  task  is  memorized  .
I  mean, Don't  get  me  wrong.
And  every  student  who  studies  math  science  engineering  economics, they  should  definitely  learn  calculus.
It's  understanding  data  
Look  the  world  has  changed  from  analog  to  digital  
The  majority  of  our  functional  brain  is  distributed  over  the  outer  surface  layer  of  the  brain  and  to  increase  the  area  That's  available  for  mental  capacity.
Our  breakthrough  was  to  create  an  algorithm  that  unfolds  the  cortex, so  that  we  can  map  the  signals  closer  to  its  source, and  therefore  making  it  capable  of  working  across  a  mass  population.
The  second  challenge  is  the  actual  device  for  observing  brainwaves  
With  neutral  There's, nothing  in  particular  that  evan  needs  to  do  
It  takes  eight  seconds  to  do  this. And  now  that  That's  done, we  can  choose  a  Movement-based  action.
So, evan, choose  something  that  you  can  visualize  clearly  in  your  mind  
So  the  idea  here  now  is  that  evan  needs  to  imagine  the  object  coming  forward  into  the  screen  and  There's  a  progress  bar  that  will  scroll  across  the  screen  while  He's  doing  that  
The  first  time  nothing  will  happen, because  the  system  has  no  idea  how  he  thinks  about  pull  
So  one, two  three, go  
Okay, 
Ah, good  job, 
That's  really  amazing  
So  what  you  want  to  do  --  at  least  with  Movement-based  actions, we  do  that  all  the  time.
So  I'd  like  to  show  you  a  few  examples, because  there  are  many  possible  applications  for  this  new  interface.
And  bed  nets  have  an  effect  on  the  epidemic, but  You're  never  going  to  make  it  extinct  with  bed  nets.
We  could  spend  hours  going  over  this  
It  creates  a  very  high  peak  power, and  it  lets  you  do  all  kinds  of  interesting  things.
And  using  both  this  technique  and  other  optical  techniques, we  think  we  can  make  those  diagnostics  
We  also  have  another  Hemozoin-oriented  therapy  for  malaria, a  way  in  acute  cases  to  actually  take  the  malaria  parasite  and  filter  it  out  of  the  blood  system.
You  can  give  drug  administration  
We  have  all  of  the  precipitation  data  and  the  temperature  data  
That's  very  important  because  the  humidity  and  precipitation  tell  you  whether  You've  got  standing  pools  of  water  for  the  mosquitoes  to  breed  
So  that  sets  the  stage  on  which  you  do  this  
Now, one  of  the  ways  you  can  make  them  not  fly  is  with  ddt  
In  1935, there  were  150000  cases  a  year  of  malaria  in  the  united  states, but  ddt  and  a  massive  public  health  effort  managed  to  Squelch  it  
Audience: yeah, ,
Nathan  myhrvold, okay, so  our  legal  department  prepared  a  Disclaimer.
Now, after  thinking  about  this  a  little  bit, we  thought, you  know, it  probably  would  be  simpler  to  do  this  with  a  Nonlethal  laser  
We  have  the  device  over  here.
Now, That's  a  fairly  straightforward  image  processing  routine. And  let  me  show  you  how  it  works.
This  is  very  satisfying  
It  grows  and  is  nurtured  
Basically  a  restaurant, just  like  any  other  
Chairs, recycled  and  recyclable  
I  was  experimenting  with  these  --  i  Don't  know  if  you  can  see  it  --  but  There's  a  work  surface, there  
This  is  the  kitchen, which  is  in  the  same  room.
Rather  than  me  putting  a  dish  down, they  were  allowed  to  help  themselves  to  as  much, or  as  little  as  they  wanted  
This  is  the  waste  room  
In  here  i  have  produce  and  boxes  that  are  Unavoidable  
I'm  taking  the  temperature  of  the  canal  outside  pumping  it  through  the  heat  exchange  mechanism, It's  turning  through  these  amazing  sails  on  the  roof.
In  the  canal, which  is  just  outside  the  restaurant, there  is  hundreds  of  meters  of  coil.
He's  growing  all  his  own  fruit  and  That's  fantastic  
So  You've  got  to  watch  your  space  for  that  
Okay, so  this  is  my  next  project: 
I  mean, the  whole  thing  is  is  Super-sustainable  
And  no  One's  doing  that, just  yet  
This  is  a  herd, and  it  is  built  according  to  Genetical  codes.
In  fact, It's  a  new  invention  of  the  wheel  
In  fact, this  is  better  than  a  wheel  because  when  you  try  to  drive  with  your  bicycle  on  the  beach, you  will  notice  It's  very  hard  to  do  
Ok, good  
So, as  soon  it  has  been  to  the  sea, it  changes  the  pattern  of  Zeroes  and  ones  here. And  it  knows  always  where  it  is  on  the  beach.
So  It's  a  sort  of  imagination  of  the  simple  world  of  the  beach  animal  
We  did  haemophilus  Influenzae.
In  2003, we  published  our  first  success  
So  ham  smith  and  Clyde  Hutchison, developed  some  new  methods  for  making  Error-free  dna  at  a  small  level, 
And  we  can  walk  through  the  reasons  for  that. But  basically  the  small  cell  took  on  the  order  of  one  to  two  months  to  get  results  from  whereas  the  larger  Faster-growing  cell  takes  only  two  days.
It's  an  amazing  step  forward, but  we  had  a  problem  because  now  we  had  the  bacterial  chromosomes  growing  in  yeast  
And  we  thought  this  would  be  a  great  test  bed  for  learning  how  to  get  chromosomes  out  of  yeast  and  transplant  them.
We  Narrowed  it  down  to  one  fragment, we  sequenced  it  and  found  just  one  base  pair  had  been  deleted  in  an  essential  gene  
We  got  a  text  from  dan  saying  that  now  the  first  blue  colonies  existed, 
So  early  on, we  developed  the  notion  of  putting  in  watermarks  in  the  dna  to  absolutely  make  clear  that  the  dna  was  synthetic  
It's  significant  to  us  
So  when  you  see  how  long  it  took  to  get  an  H1n1  vaccine  out, we  think  we  can  Shorten  that  process  quite  substantially  
You  may  have  heard  about  the  Koran's  idea  of  paradise  being  72  virgins.
It's  just  29  words  in  arabic, but  anywhere  from  65  to  72  in  translation  
But  all  is  not  lost  in  translation.
And  that  number  72, never  appears  
There  are  no  72  virgins  in  the  koran.
They  all  live  in  colonies  consisting  of  one  or  a  few  queens.
Here's  my  study  site, this  is  really  a  picture  of  ants. And  the  rabbit  just  happens  to  be  there.
Ants  never  make  more  ants. Colonies  make  more  colonies.
And  this  shows  a  recently  virgin  queen, Here's, her  wings, 
She  lays  eggs, she  feeds  the  larvae  --  so  an  ant  starts  as  an  egg, then  It's, a  larva  
So  things  happen  to  an  ant  colony  
When  it  rains  in  the  summer, it  floods  in  the  desert  
And  That's  the  process  that  i  call  task  allocation  
That  is  that  there  are  chambers  inside  they  line  the  walls  of  the  chambers  with  moist  soil, and  it  dries  to  a  kind  of  an  Adobe-like  surface  in  it.
And  finally, the  midden  workers  put  some  kind  of  territorial  chemical  in  the  garbage  
So  an  ant  starts  out  somewhere  near  the  queen  
The  Queen's  in  there, somewhere, she  just  lays  eggs, 
So  just  to  reinforce  that  what  you  might  have  thought  about  ant  queens, Isn't, true  --  you  know, even  if  the  queen  did  have  the  intelligence  to  send  chemical  messages  through  this  whole  network  of  chambers  to  tell  the  ants  outside  what  to  do.
We  started  out  with  model  airplane  paint, and  then  we  found  these  wonderful  little  japanese  markers, and  they  work  really  well  
And  so  just  to  summarize, the  result, well  it  turns  out  that, yes, the  different  tasks  are  interdependent.
And  the  second  result, which  was  surprising  to  a  lot  of  people  was  that  ants  actually  switch  tasks.
The  same  ant  Doesn't  do  the  same  task  over  and  over  its  whole  life.
This  process  changes  with  colony  age, and  it  changes  like  this  
Instead  something  about  the  organization  must  be  changing  as  the  colony  gets  older  
And  what  We're  learning  is  that  an  ant  uses  the  pattern  of  its  Antennal  contacts  the  rate  at  which  it  meets  ants  of  other  tasks  in  deciding  what  to  do  
And  We've  just  recently  demonstrated  this  by  putting  extract  of  hydrocarbons  on  little  glass  beads  and  dropping  the  beads  gently  down  into  the  nest  entrance  at  the  right  rate.
So  i  want  now  to  show  you  a  bit  of  film  --  and  this  will  start  out  first  of  all  showing  you  the  nest  entrance  
This  is  taken  through  a  fiber  optics  microscope  It's  down  inside  the  nest  
Each  ant, then, as  it  comes  back  in  is  contacting  other  ants.
So  What's  interesting  about  this  system  is  that  It's  messy  
Again, i  Don't  want  to  say  that  this  kind  of  Haphazard  pattern  of  interactions  produces  a  factory  that  works  with  the  precision  and  efficiency  of  clockwork  
That  we  can  take  the  whole  idea  that  gave  birth  to  the  internet  and  bring  it  down  to  the  physical  world  in  this  internet  zero  this  internet  of  devices, 
Unlike  this  screen  where  the  dots  are  placed  carefully, this  is  a  raw  material.
This  was  just  a  proof  of  principle.
But  i  had  a  problem  once  i  had  all  these  machines, i  was  spending  too  much  time  teaching  students  to  use  them.
When  a  user  screams  into  scream, buddy, their  scream  is  silenced.
But  you  Don't  use  it  for  inventory  and  payroll  Dec  is  now  twice  bankrupt. You  Don't  need  personal  fabrication  in  the  home  to  buy  what  you  can  buy  because  you  can  buy  it.
And  the  way  you  close, it  is  not  it  for  the  masses, but  it  development  for  the  masses.
You  can  see  it  in  their  face.
We  designed  a  network  sensor  and  kids  would  show  up  and  refuse  to  leave  the  lab  
This  is  late  at, you  know, 11  o'clock  at  night. And  i  think  i  was  the  only  person  surprised  when  what  she  built  worked.
And  again, that  was  just  for  the  joy  of  it  
And  then  in  turn, businesses  started  to  grow  like  making  these  antennas  
We're  learning  more  from  them  than  We're, giving  them  
I  was  showing  my  kids  in  a  fab  lab  how  to  use  it  
Real  invention  is  happening  in  these  labs.
Pdps  came  between  Mainframes  and  Minicomputers  
It  was  there  because  they  wanted  to  find  animals  in  the  mountains, but  it  Outgrew  it. So  they  built  this  extraordinary  village  for  the  lab.
If  this  room  full  of  heroes  is  just  clever  enough, you  can  solve  the  problems.
The  message  coming  from  the  fab  labs  is  that  the  other  five  billion  people  on  the  planet, Aren't, just  technical  Sinks, They're  sources, 
That  has  got  to  be  stopped  
Somehow  that  Doesn't  seem  right  
So  here  we  are  using  20  million  barrels  a  day  --  producing  eight  importing  12.
Now, i  had  people  in  washington.
We're  headed  to  natural  gas  
Run  it  through  the  Separator  and  You're  ready  to  use  it  
Natural  gas  will  fit  all  of  those  
It  will  replace  or  be  able  to  be  used  for  that  
So  i  have  tried  to  target  on  where  we  use  the  natural  gas  
And  where  I've  targeted  is  on  the  Heavy-duty  trucks, 
There  are  eight  million  of  them  
I'm  back  to  theorist  again, 
So  There's, nothing  going  on  that  impresses  me  in  washington  on  that  plan, other  than  I'm  trying  to  focus  on  that  eight  million  18-wheelers  
Thank  you  
That'll  make  you  abandon  something  
I'm, a  Geologist  got  out  of  school  in  '51  and  I've  been  in  the  industry.
I'm, not  a  big  natural  gas  producer  
You've  made  the  money.
Does  that  make  sense  
The  government  is  not  successful  on  these  things.
But  chris, i  think  where  We're  headed  the  long-term, i  Don't  mind  going  back  to  nuclear  
There  Isn't  anything  wrong  with  nuke  
Tbp: fracking, what  is  fracking  
I  mean, seriously, the  department  of  energy  did  not  have  anything  to  do  with  fracking.
The  first  Frack  job  was  in  '47  
There's, no  problems  
If  someone  comes  to  you  with  a  plan  that  really  looks  like, it  might  be  part  of  this  solution. Are  you  ready  to  invest  in  those  technologies, even  if  they  Aren't  Maximized  for  profits, they  might  be  Maximized  for  the  future  health  of  the  planet.
When  you  think  about  resilience  and  technology  It's  actually  much  easier  
The  internet  was  also  very  real.
People  on  the  east  coast  in  1849, when  they  first  started  to  get  the  news, they  thought, ah, this  Isn't, real  ,
You  had  dotcom  fever, and  you  had  gold  fever.
And  they  Wouldn't  let  the  other  half  out  to  go  look  for  the  first  half  because  they  were  afraid  they  Wouldn't  come  back.
They  had  bad  burn  rate  in  the  gold  rush, a  very  bad  burn  rate.
This  is  a  commercial  that  was  played  on  the  super  bowl  in  the  year.
Bride  #1, you  said, you  had  a  large  selection  of  invitations  Clerk, but  we  do  
Husband  #2, not  for  another  15  minutes.
Ourbeginningcom  Life's  an  event, announce  it  to  the  world  
So  There's  a  much  better  analogy  that  allows  you  to  be  incredibly  optimistic. And  that  analogy  is  the  electric  industry.
This  was  a  huge  --  as  you  would  expect  --  a  huge  capital  build  out.
Well, it  was  because  that  heavy  infrastructure  had  already  been  laid  down.
They  would  --  each  room  typically  had  a  light  bulb  socket  at  the  top  
And  There's  a  rotor  there  --  that  this  motor  is  spinning  
And  they  were  really  happy  that  the  guy  had  a  Speakerphone, because  then  they  had  to  wait  on  hold  for  an  hour  to  talk  to  somebody  to  give  them  an  access  code. After  they  got  there.
Because  you  know, resilience  --  if  you  think  of  it  in  terms  of  the  gold  rush, then  You'd  be  pretty  depressed  right  now.
She  --  but  you  know, if  you  really  do  believe  that  It's  the  very  very  beginning, if  you  believe  It's  the  1908  hurley  washing  machine, then  You're  incredibly  optimistic.
The  golden  rule  is  great  I'm, a  big  Supporter  of  both  
In  the  beginning, there  was  compassion.
I  warned  you, this  was  not  going  to  be  very  warm  and  fuzzy  
Now, There's  more  good  news  that  came  along  later  in  evolution, a  second  kind  of  evolutionary  logic, 
And  so  you  wind  up  most  easily  extending  compassion  to  friends  and  allies  
So  i  hope  I've  got  your  attention  with  this  promise  of  good  news  that  may  save  the  world  
Basically  a  zero-sum  game  is  the  kind  You're  used  to  in  sports, where  There's  a  winner  and  a  loser.
Either  way  your  fortunes  add  up  to  zero  That's, a  zero-sum  game, 
Now, if  You're  playing  doubles, then  the  person  on  your  side  of  the  net  is  in  a  non-zero-sum  relationship  with  you.
The  deployment  of  the  golden  rule, most  naturally  happens  along  these  non-zero-sum  channels  
With  zero-sum  channels, you  would  expect  something  else.
But  it  may, and  the  good  news  is  that  history  has  naturally  expanded  these  webs  of  non-zero-sumness  these  webs  that  can  be  these  channels  for  compassion.
That's  the  story  of  civilization, 
And  also, sometimes  people  Don't  recognize  the  non-zero-sum  dynamics  in  the  world.
I  think  politicians  can  help  foster  non-zero-sum  relationships. Economic  engagement  is  generally  better  than  Blockades.
If  There's  one  thing  i  can  encourage  everyone  to  do  politicians, religious  leaders  and  us, it  would  be  what  i  call  expanding  the  moral  imagination  --  that  is  to  say, your  ability  to  put  yourself  in  the  shoes  of  people  in  very  different  circumstances.
Once  upon  a  time  i  did  a  book  called  how  buildings  learn  
So  the  design  problem  for  today  is  going  to  be  how  do  you  house  an  eventual  monumental  clock  like  this? So  it  can  really  tick  save  time  beautifully  for  100  centuries.
And  it  looked  like  a  way  to  go  until  you  start  thinking  about  what  does  deep  time  do  to  a  building  
This  is  the  Parthenon  It's  only  2450  years  old  and  look  what  happened  to  it.
And  now, It's  a  pathetic  ruin  and  no  one  even  knows  what  it  was  used  for  
Underground  in  a  place, That's  really  solid  
It's  right  on  the  eastern  border  of  nevada, 
It  starts  with  the  image.
The  labyrinth  is  a  concept  It's  like  a  twilight  zone, It's  a  place  where  It's  difficult, where  you  get  disoriented, maybe  you  get  scared  --  but  you  have  to  go  through  it  if  You're  going  to  get  to  some  kind  of  deep  reintegration  
The  hillis  algorithm, 10, Factorial  gives  you  that  number  
Something  you  Didn't  expect  that  caps, what  you  did  expect  
And  then  how  about  a  Memento  number  seven  
What  are  the  elements  that  will  most  affect  your  ideas  and  decisions?
People  think  They're  just  the  size  of  Shrubs, but  That's, not  actually  true  
That's.
But  it  goes  a  Mile-and-a-half  in  a  straight  line  due  east  into  the  range  into  very  interesting  territory  --  except  that  as  You'll  see, when  we  go  inside  in  a  minute, we  were  hoping  for  limestone.
Competent  rock  is  rock  that  will  hold  itself  up  without  any  shoring  
You  may  recognize  a  couple  of  the  miners  there.
And  alexander  rose  on  the  left  there  worked  with  a  bunch  of  people  from  the  national  park  to  survey  the  whole  mine  It's  a  mile  deep  
Kurt  Bollacker  and  alexander  rose  designed  a  radically  wireless  station.
But  There's, no  bears  and  There's, no  poison  oak  and  There's, basically, no  people. Because  this  place  has  been  empty  for  a  long  time.
Well, Here's  a  potential  approach, 
You  need  to  come  up  the  lincoln  canyon  
It's  a  secret  passage  It's  like  something  from  Tolkien  
And  then, of  course, the  next  thing  i  hear  is  I've  made  it  to  the  top. You  can  see  all  of  creation  from  up  here.
In  fact, there  he  is  That's.
This  discovery  changed  everything  about  our  sense  of  these  cliffs  and  what  to  do  with  them  
So  even  with  the  slowing  of  the  rotation  of  the  earth  and  so  on  the  clock  will  keep  perfectly  good  time.
So  here, We're, looking  from  the  south  look  north  
Over  on  the  eastern  side, It's  gentle, as  you  can  see  
And  That's, not  snow  --  That's  what  the  white  limestone  looks  like  
Another  is  the  experience  in  the  mountain  
And  the  third  is  the  experience  from  the  mountain, which  is  really  dominated  by  the  view  shed  of  the  spring  valley  there  behind  danny.
This  is  rocky  mountain  Junipers  that  have  been  there  for  thousands  of  years.
Ok, Let's. Take  one  more  look  at  the  mountain  itself.
And  this  stone  takes  a  perfect  polish  
Most  of  the  Amazingness  of  the  clock, we  can  borrow  from  the  Amazingness  of  the  mountain  
And  often  I'm  driving  in  a  taxi, and  i  see  a  hole  in  a  shirt  or  something  that  looks  very  interesting, or  pretty  or  functional  in  some  way  that  I'd  never  seen  happen  before.
I  Don't  know  where  inspiration  comes  from  
And  i  think  about, you  know  their  roles  and  about  how  you  have  to  like  watch  what  your  daughters  look  at  
So  actually  check  this  out  
I  was  dating  this  guy  right?
I  was  dating  this  guy, and  it  was  going  on  for  about  a  year  right?
And  i  kind  of  try  not  to  look  back, you  know, 
And  frankly, i  Don't  really  know  what  to  call  myself.
Too  much  time  on  computer  bridge, which  is, you  know, like  That's. So  somehow  like  about  ten  years  ago, i  thought  that  the  most  Unboring  place  in  the  world  would  be  like  a  tv  studio  like  for  a  day  show.
Because  It's  all  of  these  things  that  i  love  all  kind  of  in  one  place, 
Hi  there  
Rod: cutting  hair  
Just  checking  because  some  people  want  to  look, you  know, aggressively  ugly  
A  oh  no  We're, just  Staging  rod: We're, just  Staging.
I'll  tell  you  that  i  cook  a  lot, also, i  love  to  cook  
This  is  what  I've  been  doing, because  i  think  It's  the  most  fun  thing  in  the  world.
It's  got  a  lot  of  different  things  on  it.
Yeah, but  i  can  never  find  buttermilk  ever  .
Chef  for  cream, 
Have  you  ever  wondered  how  such  a  situation  can  be  turned  around  
Have  you  ever  looked  at  the  arab  uprisings  and  thought, how  could  we  have  predicted  that  
But  i  believe  now  that  We're  moving  into  a  new  age, and  that  age  the  new  york  times  Dubbed  recently  as  the  age  of  behavior  
And  these  ideas  and  narratives  that  bump  people  across  borders  are  increasingly  beginning  to  affect  the  way  in  which  people  behave  
If  we  look  at  islamists, if  we  look  at  the  phenomenon  of  far-right  Fascists, one  thing  They've  been  very  good  at  one  thing  that  They've  actually  been  exceeding  in  is  communicating  across  borders, using  technologies  to  organize  themselves  to  propagate  their  message  and  to  create  truly  global  phenomena.
But  having  been  born  in  essex  at  the  age  of  16, i  joined  an  organization  
By  the  age  of  24, i  found  myself  convicted  in  prison  in  egypt, being  Blacklisted  from  three  countries  in  the  world  for  attempting  to  Overthrow  their  governments, being  subjected  to  torture  in  egyptian  jails  and  sentenced  to  five  years  as  a  prisoner  of  conscience.
The  age  of  behavior  where  ideas  and  narratives  were  increasingly  defining  behavior  and  identity  and  allegiances  
In  certain  countries, mosque  Minarets  are  being  banned  
And  why  are  democracy  Aspirants  falling  behind  
So  the  ideas  and  the  narratives  of  al-qaeda  come  to  your  mind  immediately, 
One  of  their  leaders  was  killed  in  pakistan  recently, 
To  go  around  saying  that  i  believe  democratic  culture  is  the  best  that  We've  arrived  at  as  a  form  of  political  organizing  is  associated  with  extremism.
When  talking  about  those  reasons  Let's  break  down  certain  preconceptions  
But  without  freedom  of  speech, you  Can't  have  free  and  fair  elections  
In  the  '80s  and  '90s, when  islamism  started  in  the  region, it  spread  across  the  mena  region  as  a  whole  
Now, That's  a  big  claim, I'm  going  to  try  to  back  it  up.
Slow  Text-based  conversations  then  real-time  voice  based  conversations  
He  traces  the  edges  of  the  individual  networks, and  then  color  codes  them  
But  they  Weren't  given  that  choice  because  their  own  citizens  beat  them  to  the  punch.
Essentially  to  say, we  will  do  anything  to  Placate  you  just  please  stop  protesting  in  public  
And  so  the  protest  kept  going  
And  so  they  began  to  arrest  the  protesters  
All  of  that  is  over  
He  had  said  in  january  that  he  would  not  sign  a  bill  that  granted  telecom  immunity  for  possibly  Warrantless  Spying  on  american  persons  
It  was  senator  obama  when  they  created  it, they  changed  the  name  later.
He  had  to  issue  a  reply  
And  he  said, essentially, i  have  considered  the  issue  
Media  the  media  landscape  that  we  knew  as  familiar  as  it  was  as  easy  conceptually  as  it  was  to  deal  with  the  idea  that  professionals  broadcast  messages  to  amateurs  is  increasingly  slipping  away.
That's, the  media  environment, We've  got  
And  today, after  the  global  economic  crisis, there  was  a  whole  new  set  of  rules  about  how  the  state  should  intervene  
The  first  to  my  mind  is  what  i  call  as  the  ideas  that  have  arrived  
We  thought  of  people  as  a  liability  
This  change  has  contributed  to  the  vitality  and  the  whole  economy  
And  the  fact  that  we  have  english  is  now  becoming  a  huge  strategic  asset  
One  is  the  question  of  education: 
The  third  thing  is, again, cities  
But  today, finally, after  economic  reforms  and  economic  growth, i  think  the  notion  that  cities  are  engines  of  economic  growth. Cities  are  engines  of  creativity.
A  lot  of  the  indian  problems  are  related  to  the  ideology  of  caste  and  other  things.
Therefore  we  will  fundamentally  rethink  the  way  we  look  at  the  environment, the  way  we  look  at  energy, the  way  we  create  whole  new  paradigms  of  development.
Why  does  What's  happening  10  thousand  miles  away  matter  to  all  of  you  
And  that  makes  a  huge  difference.
When  india  was  growing  at  about  three  35  percent, and  the  population  was  growing  at  two  percent. Its  per  capita  income  was  doubling  every  45  years.
I've  been  there  six  times  four  times. I   did  work  with  national  geographic  making  tectonic  plate  measurements. Twice, i  went  with  nasa  doing  remote  sensing  devices.
That  gives  you  an  idea  of  just  how  severe  things  are  near  the  summit.
There  were  three  other  expeditions  on  the  mountain, an  american  team, a  new  zealand  team  and  an  imax  team  
And  from  there, we  climb  up  to  camp  two, which  is  sort  of  the  foreground  
If  you  notice  the  summit  of  everest  is  black  
This  is  not  good  weather  to  climb  in.
The  summit  would  be  in  the  foreground  
But  what  happened  that  year  was  the  wind  suddenly  and  unexpectedly  picked  up  
I  have  an  oxygen  hose  connected  here.
Ok, this  is  a  view  taken  on  the  summit  ridge  itself  
But  either  way  you  fall  for  the  rest  of  your  life, 
This  is  taken  from  camp  three, where  i  was  
So, as  the  climbers  came  by  me, i  sort  of  Assessed, whether  or  not  they  were  in  condition  to  continue  on  further  down  
His  wife  was  home  in  new  zealand, seven  months  pregnant  with  their  first  child. And  rob  asked  to  be  Patched  into  her  that  was  done  and  rob  and  his  wife  had  their  last  conversation.
It's  a  tackle  box  filled  with  medical  supplies.
What  we  did  was  try  to  warm  them  up  as  best  we  could  put  oxygen  on  them  and  try  to  revive  them, which  is  difficult  to  do  at  21000  feet.
As  i  was  taking  care  of  these  climbers, we  got  a  startling  experience.
But  beck  Wasn't  dead, he  heard  that, but  he  was  completely  unable  to  move  .
Now  you  go  to  this  one, and  you  see  how  much  more  the  frontal  lobes  are  lighting  up  
He's  trying  to  get  his  muscles  going  and  get  out  of  this  
It's  too  cold, he  Can't  keep  his  metabolic  fires  going. And  you  see  There's, no  more  red. Here  his  brain  is  Quieting  down.
He's  thinking  about  what  He's  got  to  do  to  save  himself  
He's  not  thinking  about  his  family  now  and  He's  getting  himself, motivated  
A  helicopter  came  in  at  21000  feet  and  carried  out  the  highest  helicopter  rescue  in  history.
It's  our  trailer  because  i  know, obviously  you  guys  are  busy.
If  we  could  roll  
Michael  Moriarty's, wife, It's, really  hard  for  him  to  not  have  his  dad  
They're  shooting  at  me, 
Deborah  Scranton, thank  you  
We  were  one  of  the  lucky  ones  to  get  in  the  class  with  the  sony  cameras  and  the  vista  software  
I  mean, we  were  there  for  an  hour, talking  ,
And  it  really  highlighted  something  that  i  would  like  to  ask  you  guys  to  think  about.
How  do  we  open  it  up  to  really  be  able  to  have  a  conversation?
It  was  mass  casualties.
This  is  blood  
Five: soldiers  filmed  the  entire  time  
They  spent  their  entire  day  outside  the  wire  trying  to  save  iraqi  lives  --  the  iraqis  who  work  on  the  post, 
And  for  me, It's  trying  to  bridge  that  disconnect  ,
I  get  --  I'm  often  asked, you  know, for  me  what  have  been  some  of  the  special  moments  from  having  worked  on  this  film, 
And  he  looked  at  me  and  i  smiled, and  then  i  saw  the  tears, start  Welling  up  in  his  eyes.
So  when  i  talk  about  a  disconnect  It's, not  only  for  maybe  those  people  who  Don't  know  a  soldier, which  there  obviously  are, you  know, these  days  It's, not  like  world  war  ii, where  there  was  a  war  front  and  a  home  front.
Do  you  give  money  to  any  of  the  charities  
Do  you  really  care  
And  it  was  something  called  Ecorock  
And  they  worked  absolutely  very, very, very  hard  
That's  the  finished  production  line, there  
We  must  change  everything  
So  Let's, first  talk  about  focused  ultrasound  
And  i  hold  in  my  hand, a  Tissue-mimicking  phantom  
It  is  transparent  made  just  for  you  
This  is  a  setup  i  put  in  a  physics  lab  
We  need  to  reach  a  target  inside  the  brain  
But  you  may  not  know  that  he  tried  to  perform  Lobotomies  in  the  brain  noninvasively  with  focused  ultrasound  in  the  '50s  
And  it  makes  you  ponder  why  those  pioneers  failed  
They  were  missing  the  vision  
It  is  approved  under  an  Fdaide  at  the  university  of  virginia, in  Charlottesville, using  focused  ultrasound  to  Ablate  a  point  in  his  Thalamus  
We  attach  a  transducer  in  this  case  to  the  brain, but  if  it  will  be  a  different  organ, it  will  be  a  different  transducer  attached  to  the  patient.
It's  a  target  in  the  Thalamus  
It  Doesn't  do  any  damage, but  it  elevates  the  temperature  by  a  few  degrees  
But  here  we  can  get  both  the  anatomical  imaging  and  the  temperature  maps  in  real  time.
So  once  the  physician  Verifies  that  the  focus  spot  is  on  the  target, he  has  chosen, then  we  move  to  perform  a  Full-energy  Ablation, like  you  see  here  
And  you  have  to  understand  what  is  in  People's  mind  when  they  are  willing  to  take  the  risk  
They  drove  like  three  hours  from  their  farm  to  the  hospital  
So  again, this  is  an  immediate  relief.
I  Don't  see, without  this  nation, taking  it  as  some  collective  will  or  something  that  is  a  national  goal  to  make  that  happen. It  will  not  happen.
And  It's  not  just  because  of  regulation  It's  because  of  the  amount  of  money  needed  under  the  current, evidence-based  medicine  and  the  size  of  trials. And  so  on  to  make  it  happen.
And  we  have  Better-than-surgery  results  in  breasts  
Women  suffer  from  that  disease  
In  the  fashion  industry, There's  very  little  intellectual  property  protection  
It's  because  It's  a  lot  harder  for  Knock-off  artists  to  knock  off  these  designs  because  they  Can't  knock  off  the  logo  
Now, the  reason  for  this, the  reason  that  the  fashion  industry  Doesn't  have  any  copyright  protection  is  because  the  courts  decided  long  ago  that  Apparel  is  too  utilitarian  to  qualify  for  copyright  protection.
Now, fashion  designers  have  the  Broadest  palette  imaginable  in  this  creative  industry.
People  think  this  is  a  magical  thing. How  does  it  happen?
Johanna  Blakley: imagine  that  
They  make  deals  with  the  fast  fashion  giants, and  they  come  up  with  a  way  to  sell  their  product  to  a  whole  new  demographic, the  santee  alley  demographic  
Very  low  novelty  standard.
That  is  a  very  difficult  question  to  answer  
Fireworks  displays, the  rules  of  games, the  smell  of  perfume.
It  is  more  complex  than  this, but  this  will  do  
The  problem  is  that  digital  technology  has  completely  Subverted. The  logic  of  this  physically  fixed  expression  versus  idea.
This  individual  lives  in  the  atacama  desert  in  chile, and  it  happens  to  be  3000  years  old  
And  I'm  also  trying  to  create  a  means  in  which  to  step  outside  our  Quotidian  experience  of  time, and  to  start  to  consider  a  deeper  timescale  
I'd  been  traveling  in  japan  without  an  agenda  other  than  to  photograph. And  then  i  heard  about  this  tree  that  is  2180  years  old  and  knew  that  i  had  to  go  visit.
This  is  a  clonal  tree  as  well  
I  spoke  to  the  biologist  who  discovered  this  tree. And  he  told  me  that  that  Spindly  growth  you  see  there  in  the  center  is  most  likely  a  product  of  climate  change.
Does  anybody  know  how  old  the  oldest  tortoise  is  --  any  guesses  
And  then  you  might  have  heard  of  this  giant  clam  that  was  discovered  off  the  coast  of  northern  iceland  that  reached  405  years  old  
However, it  died  in  the  lab  as  they  were  determining  its  age  
I  had  the  opportunity  to  travel  around  the  Limpopo  province  in  south  africa  with  an  expert  in  Baobab  trees, 
They  contain  thousands  of  years  of  their  own  histories  within  themselves, and  they  also  contain  records  of  natural  and  human  events.
And  it  actually  never  Sheds  those  leaves. So  it  also  bears  the  distinction  of  having  the  longest  leaves  in  the  plant  kingdom.
This  is  something  called  an  underground  forest  
The  tree  can  easily  recover  
But  What's  unique  about  it  is  that  It's  doing  dna, repair  below  freezing  
It's  my  hope  that  by  going  to  find  these  organisms  that  i  can  help  draw  attention  to  their  remarkable  resilience  and  help  play  a  part  in  Insuring, their  continued  longevity  into  the  Foreseeable  future.
Our  leaders  and  ourselves  want  everything.
And  when  we  would  gather  as  fellows, she  would  push  us  to  think  about  how  the  elders  in  native  american  culture  make  decisions  
They  said, they  would  try  so  hard  to  remember  the  fragments  of  the  dance, hoping  that  others  were  alive  and  doing  the  same  
But  we  find  those  entrepreneurs  who  put  people  and  the  planet  before  profit, 
And  It's  only  when  we  honor  them  and  celebrate  them  and  give  them  status  that  the  world  will  really  change  
For  two  years, he  hardly  made  any  money, a  tiny  Stipend.
He  said, long  story, 
We  can  take  the  easier  road  the  more  cynical  road, which  is  a  road  based  on  sometimes  dreams  of  a  past  that  never  really  was  a  fear  of  each  other  Distancing  and  blame  
I  had  the  great  honor  of  working  with  the  child  psychologist  dr. Robert  Coles  who  stood  up  for  change  during  the  civil  rights  movement  in  the  united  states.
My  final  story  is  about  a  young  beautiful  man  named  Josephat  Byaruhanga, who  was  another  acumen  fund  fellow, who  Hails  from  uganda, a  farming  community  
And  we  placed  him  in  a  company  in  western  kenya, just  200  miles  away.
And  he  said  to  me  at  the  end  of  his  year  jacqueline, it  was  so  humbling, because  i  thought  as  a  farmer  and  as  an  african, i  would  understand  how  to  transcend  culture.
Robert  kennedy  once  said  that  few  of  us  have  the  greatness  to  bend  history  itself, but  each  of  us  can  work  to  change  a  small  portion  of  events.
But  we  do  not  know  his  face  
I  find  that  hard  to  believe  
It  also  has  to  be  sufficiently  detailed  
All  we  did  was  look  for  portraits  that  had  the  characteristics  of  a  self-portrait.
They  are  made  in  the  right  order.
It  has  stored  recorded  can  Fastly  retrieve  the  meanings  of  thousands, tens  of  thousands  of  objects  actions  and  their  relationships  in  the  world.
Now  movement  has  advanced  to  the  point  where  it  can  actually  control  movement  simultaneously  in  a  complex  sequence  in  complex  ways  as  would  be  required, for  example, for  playing  a  complicated  game, like  soccer  
You  could  go  out  into  the  community  in  monterey  and  You'd  have  difficulty  finding  a  boy  that  has  this  ability  
And  in  fact, they  result  in  a  wonderful  differentiation  in  humankind  in  the  way  that, in  fact, no, two  of  us  are  quite  alike  
And  we  try  to  track  the  changes  that  occur  as  the  new  skill  or  ability  is  acquired  
From  these  studies, we  defined  two  great  Epochs  of  the  plastic  history  of  the  brain  
And  that  is  the  period  in  which  the  brain  is  setting  up  in  its  initial  form, its  basic  processing  machinery.
And  i  see  the  brain  actually  develop  a  processor  that  is  specialized  --  specialized  for  that  complex  array  a  repertoire  of  sounds  
He's  successful  in  his  retrieval  of  food  with  this  tool, every  time  
We  can  look  down  in  the  brain  of  the  monkey  
We've  actually  distorted  the  map  by  the  exercise  
And  each  one  of  them  changes  in  ways  that  are  specific  to  the  skill  or  ability.
It  represents  changes  of  hundreds  of  millions, possibly  billions  of  synaptic  connections  in  your  brain.
That  is  why  you  in  your  many  skills  and  abilities  are  a  unique  specialist, a  specialist  That's  vastly  different  in  your  physical  brain, in  detail  than  the  brain  of  an  individual  100  years  ago, enormously  different  in  the  details  from  the  brain  of  the  average  individual  1000  years  ago.
It's, not  english  It's  noisy.
Changing  it  in  detail.
You  can  see  that  most  of  the  children  on  the  left  side  of  the  distribution  are  moving  into  the  middle  or  the  right  
This  is  a  substantially  large  impact  
I'm  specifically  interested  in  things  like  autism  and  cerebral  palsy.
But  also, in  your  future  is  brain  Aerobics  
Get  ready  for  it? It's  going  to  be  a  part  of  every  life, not  too  far  in  the  future. Just  like  physical  exercise  is  a  part  of  every  well, organized  life  in  the  contemporary  period.
Of  course, a  lot  of  people  will  ignore  this  advice  
And  one  of  the  stories  he  told  me, so  often, when  i  was  a  young  boy, was  of  the  first  british  atomic  bomb  test  
What  he  was  trying  to  do  with  me, was  to  inspire  me  to  protect  the  world  and  show  me  just  how  fragile  the  world  is  
I  love  the  place  
Fresh  water  freezes  at  zero  
I  remember  just  trying  to  get  out  of  the  water  
And  for  a  swimmer, you  need  to  feel  your  hands  because  you  need  to  be  able  to  grab  the  water  and  pull  it  through  with.
We  are  going  to  actually  have  to  take  them  off  
And  i  remember  looking  into  the  ice, and  there  were  big  chunks  of  white  ice  in  there, and  the  water  was  completely  black  .
It's  a  very  frightening, very, very  frightening  thought, 
It's  all  a  little  bit, frightening  and  emotional  
The  first  thing  we  need  to  do  is  we  need  to  break  this  problem  down  into  manageable  chunks  
I've  just  come  back  from  giving  a  series  of  speeches  in  some  of  the  poorest  Townships  in  south  africa  to  young  children  as  young  as  10  years  old  
We  need  to  believe  in  ourselves, 
But  the  most  important  thing  we  must  do  is, i  think  we  must  all  walk  to  the  end  of  our  lives  and  turn  around  and  ask  ourselves  a  most  fundamental  question: ,
You  take  about  eight  or  so  carbon  atoms  about  20  hydrogen  atoms  you  put  them  together  in  exactly  the  right  way.
But  what  about  oil, where  is  it  in  the  energy  system?
And  that  continues  into  the  future  with  the  renewables  that  We're  developing  today, reaching  maybe  30  percent  of  primary  energy  by  mid  century, 
I  picked  it  up  outside  of  marble  falls, texas  
And  It's  different  than  this  limestone.
Now, millions  of  abalone, every  year  make  this  shell  
It's  the  same  stuff  as  this  and  the  same  stuff  as  this  
And  why  because  the  Lowly  abalone  is  able  to  lay  down  the  calcium  carbonate  crystals  in  layers, making  this  beautiful  Iridescent  mother  of  pearl  
Very  specialized  material  that  the  abalone  Self-assembles  millions  of  abalone  all  the  time  every  day  every  year  
How  the  molecules  are  put  together  
Here's  a  piece  of  coal  
No  wonder  that  most  of  the  most  important  international  operators  in  germany, but  also  in  france  and  the  uk  and  scandinavia  everywhere  systematically  bribed  
They  are  not  as  good  at  bribing  as  many  of  their  international  competitors  are, but  they  were  not  allowed  to  show  their  strengths  because  the  world  was  eaten  up  by  grand  corruption.
In  the  first  session  --  we  had  three  sessions  over  the  course  of  two  years.
They  even  applaud  it  
The  world  bank  has  turned  from  Saulus  to  Paulus  under  Wolfensohn. They  became, i  would  say  the  strongest  Anti-corruption  agency  in  the  world.
They  have  to  have  a  much  more  transparent, financial  governance, 
And  That's  what  It's  about  
We  use  Portraiture  as  a  way  to  deliver  those  lives, but  That's, it  
And  i  thought, really  what  we  need  is  an  elders  program  to  just  sit  at  the  feet  of  amazing  people  and  hear  them  talk  
That's  barbara  Walters  and  others  like  that.
And  he  had  never  appeared  in  public.
And  she  said, well, something  very  weird  was  happening.
I  Didn't  know  what  was  going  on, but  i  was  so  part  of  the  process  of  getting  that  out.
These  were  people  through  their  90s  
But  after  the  interview, i  got  a  call  very  Gruff  voice  from  a  woman  
Never  ever  get  up  on  a  stage  with  somebody  Who's  modest. Because  all  of  these  people  have  been  assembled  to  listen  to  them, and  they  sit  there, and  they  say, aw  Shucks, it  was  an  accident.
The  worst  interview  i  ever  did.
And  she  Stonewalled  me, it  was  unbelievable  
That's  the  problem  here  and  She's  fighting  me  for  that. And  so  then  i  asked  her  a  question  --  i  Didn't  know  how  i  was  going  to  get  out  of  it  --  i  asked  her  a  question  about  her  days  as  a  playwright  and  again, Characteristically, instead  of  saying, oh, yes, i  was  a  playwright. And  this  is  what  blah  blah, blah. She  said, oh  playwright, everybody  knows.
She  wanted  the  control  of  her  final  moment, and  she  did  it  amazingly  
His  father  was  an  Sob.
Again, some  of  you  will  know  him.
And  here  is  this  man  who  had  given  his  whole  life  to  uncovering  jefferson  and  connecting  with  him. And  he  said, well  --  I'm  going  to  do  a  bad  southern  accent.
I  have  a  story  a  story  that  i  would  like  to  share  with  you  
And  It's  an  african  story, 
And  so  maybe  You're  thinking, now, why  how  an  italian  filmmaker  based  in  boston  is  so  interested  in  this  story, 
And  i  was  born  in  zambia, 
I  have  the  good  fortune  of  being  a  Filmmaker-in-residence  at  the  center  of  digital  imaging  arts  at  boston  university, 
There  are  several  themes  from  the  documentary, but  they  are  Re-edited  and  made  for  you.
Milverton  Nwokedi, you  cut  a  nice  movie  with  just  10000  dollars  in  nigeria.
They  can  afford  to  watch  their  Robocop  and  whatever  
Because  nobody  believed  that  nollywood  can  come  out  of  africa.
Narrator: Suspense  fun  and  intrigue  
It's  the  blockbuster  comedy  
It  is  not  what  you  hear, you  know, from  the  western  press  
Man: Let's: go  ,
Like  they  go  here  now. Now  you  see  the  gun  there, but  you  Won't  see  any  guns  shot.
Kevin  books  Ikeduba, what  I'm  scared  of  is  just  the  explosion  will  come  up  in  my  face.
You  know, this  is  nollywood  where  the  magic  lives  
But  always  with  a  smile, always  with  an  enthusiasm  that  is  incredible  
The  nigerian  filmmakers  really  really  are  doing  what  they  like  
And  so  It's  a  very, very  important  thing  for  them, and  for  their  audiences, 
Filmmakers  friends  of  mine, they  look  at  nollywood, and  they  say, wow, they  are  doing  what  we  really  want  to  do  and  make  a  buck  and  live  with  this  job.
No  stories  around  the  campfire  
Difficult, eh, It's, meaningless  
I  think  that  the  key  to  a  healthy  society  is  a  thriving  community  of  storytellers.
It’s, not  an  added  sequence, just  some  voices  from  nollywood.
And  we  know  that  there  are  more  
They  can  be  rented  for  pennies.
You  can  be  in  a  lagos  traffic  jam, and  you  can  buy  a  movie  or  some  bananas  or  some  water.
In  fact, it  appeared  in  a  Porno  comic  book, which  is  the  slide  on  the  right  
On  the  left-hand  side, i  had  the  context  of  those  little  houses, and  i  tried  to  build  a  building  that  fit  into  that  context.
And  then  i  did  a  law  school  for  Loyola  in  downtown  la  
And  it  was  my  theory, or  my  point  of  view  that  one  Didn't  Upstage  the  neighborhood  --  one  made  Accommodations  
I  mean, the  story  i  tell  is  that  i  got  mad  at  Postmodernism  --  at  Po-mo  --  and  said  that  fish  were  500  million  years  earlier  than  man. And  if  You're  going  to  go  back, we  might  as  well  go  back  to  the  beginning.
And  so  i  started  making  these  funny  things, 
And  the  client  said, why  no  fish  
It  was  a  dialog  with  the  context.
Couldn't  find  it  
So  
And  It's  one  of  the  nicest  pieces  I've  ever  made.
For  reasons  we  Don't  want  to  talk  about.
I  went  around  toronto  and  found  a  bathtub  like  my  Grandmother's.
And  We've  started  to  work  on  things.
The  highlight  of  the  performance  was  at  the  end, 
And  so  i  did  a  lot  of  dirty  things  with  chain  link, which  nobody  will  forgive  me  for  
It's  in  perspective  and  everything  
But  we  were  trying  to  collide  our  ideas  to  put  objects  next  to  each  other  
Like  a  Morandi  --  like  the  little  bottles  --  composing  them  like  a  still  life  
And  he  pushed  that  
And  it  was  this  interaction  between  that  kind  of  Up-the-ante  stuff  that  became  pretty  interesting  
And  i  still  think  the  time  magazine  picture  will  be  of  the  binoculars, you  know, leaving  out  the  --  what  the  hell  
I  said, if  i  Can't  get  the  craft  that  i  want  I'll  use  the  craft, i  can  get  
And  it  was  all  of  one  material, and  the  metal  could  go  on  the  roof  as  well  as  the  walls.
I  was  given  an  opportunity  to  design  an  exhibit  for  the  Metalworkers'  unions  of  america  and  canada  in  washington. And  i  did  it  on  the  condition  that  they  become  my  partners  in  the  future  and  help  me  with  all  future, metal  buildings, etc, etc. .
And  then  more  metal  and  some  chain  link  in  santa  monica  --  a  little  shopping  center  
It  gave  me  an  opportunity  to  make  a  sculpture  out  of  it.
When  you  have  to  do  something  really  cheaply  It's  hard  to  get  perfect  corners  and  stuff  
He  Didn't  recommend  me  by  the  way.
I  keep  trying  to  make  it  work.
It's  never  been  finished  
This  is  the  city  hall  over  here  somewhere  and  the  courthouse  
Sohio  is  on  the  axis  here, and  we  followed  the  axis  and  They're  two, kind  of  Goalposts  
And  all  this  stuff  at  the  bottom  is  a  museum  and  an  idea  for  a  very  fancy  automobile  entry, 
And  following  that  basic  idea  of  the  village, we  changed  it  as  we  got  into  it.
That's  the  living  room  
You  come  down  from  this  level, along  the  Stairway, and  you  enter  the  bedroom  here  going  into  the  lake  
These  Stonehenge  things  were  designed  to  give  foreground  and  to  create  a  greater  depth  in  this  shallow  lot.
I  was  trying  to  get  around  this  plan  coupe  --  how  do  you  do  it?
Jay  chiat  is  a  Glutton  for  punishment.
And  then  this  is  a  kind  of  a  shopping  mall  with  a  rodeo  and  restaurants  
It  has  a  chamber  hall  
There's  commercial  at  the  ground  floor, 
The  acoustician  in  the  competition  gave  us  criteria, which  led  to  this  compartmentalized  scheme, which  we  found  out  after  the  competition  would  not  work  at  all  
And  the  Ritz-carlton  tower  is  being  designed  with  exposed  steel, Non-fire  proof, much  like  those  old  gas  tanks  
And  the  food  Wasn't  as  good  as  the  stuff, and  so  it  failed  
Thank  you  very  much  
I  know  bill  joy  was  talking  to  you  about  the  wonders  of  carbon  nanotubes  so  I'm  going  to  talk  to  you  about  the  wonders  of  carbon  Macro-tubes, which  is  charcoal  
What  we  wanted  to  do  was  we  wanted  to  find  a  way  to  harness  this  waste  resource  and  turn  it  into  a  fuel  that  would  be  something  that  people  could  easily  cook  with  something  like  charcoal.
After  some  time  after  setting  it  on  fire, you  seal  it  to  Restrict  the  oxygen  that  goes  into  the  Kiln.
However, you  Can't  burn  this  It's, too  fine, and  it  burns  too  quickly  to  be  useful  for  cooking.
So  we  had  to  try  to  find  a  way  to  form  it  into  useful  briquettes  
Compared  to  the  sugarcane  charcoal, where  we  actually  have  to  teach  people  how  to  form  it  into  briquettes, and  you  have  the  extra  step  of  cooking, the  binder, this  comes  Pre-briquetted, 
But  this  is  one  of  the  incredibly  rare  situations  where  you  also  have  economic  benefits.
They  can  generate  income  from  this  
They  can  save  the  money  that  they  were  going  to  spend  on  charcoal, and  they  can  produce  excess  and  sell  it  in  the  market  to  people  who  Aren't  making  their  own  .
I  mean, the  world  where  advanced  building  materials  means  cement  Roofing  tiles  that  are  made  by  hand.
And  more  than  half  of  you  would  be  living  on  less  than  a  dollar  a  day  
Do  you  need  to  find  entrepreneurs  or  venture  capitalists, or  what  do  you  need  to  take  what  You've  got  and  get  it  to  scale?
These  are  some  of  my  kids  with  a  salad  bar.
And  the  very  first  thing  was  about  regional  food  --  trying  to  eat  food  from  within  our  region.
We  Can't  keep  feeding  our  kids, pesticides  and  herbicides  and  antibiotics  and  hormones  
The  usda  allows  these  antibiotics, these  hormones  and  these  pesticides  in  our  food  supply, and  the  usda  paid  for  this  ad  in  time  magazine, 
It's  no  wonder, you  know, we  have  criminals.
What  goes  in  is  what  we  are  
The  cdc  the  center  for  disease  control  has  said  of  the  children  born  in  the  year. 2000  --  those  Seven-  and  Eight-year-olds  today  --  one  out  of  every  three  Caucasians  one  out  of  every  two  african-americans  and  hispanics  are  going  to  have  diabetes  in  their  lifetime.
And  It's  because  of  what  we  feed  them  
This  is  the  usda  portion  size  that  little  tiny  thing  
In  case, you  Can't  tell  That's  like  pink  danish  and  some  kind  of  Cupcakes  
In  fact, this  may  be  what  a  lot  of  parents  serve, as  opposed  to  --  this  is  what  we  try  and  serve  
There's, not  a  strawberry  tree  or  a  carrot  bush.
You're  not  going  to  get  the  next  generation  or  the  generation  after  to  be  able  to  think  like  this, if  They're  not  Nourished  
And  these  calendars  really  started  to  lay  out  my  program  
You  know, we  have  to  change  it  
We  have  to  teach  kids  that  if  They're  on  a  diet  of  refined  sugar, they  go  up  and  down, just  like  if  They're  on  a  diet  of  crack  
And  we  have  to  pull  it  all  together. We  have  Composting  in  all  of  our  schools.
Because  you  know  what  many  of  us  are  sort  of  at  the  end  of  our  careers, and  we  need  to  be  giving  these  kids  --  these  young  kids, the  next  generation  --  the  tools  to  save  themselves  and  save  the  planet  
I  had  90  employees  
In  this  country  We're  spending  110  billion  dollars  a  year  on  fast  food, 
That  8  billion  comes  down  to  two  dollars  and  49  cents  --  That's  what  the  government  allocates  for  lunch  
And  those  are  the  same  kids  who  are  going  to  be  getting  sick.
Look  how  odd  he  looks  with  the  eyebrows  missing  
Max  has  kindly  donated  his  photograph  to  me  
Our  research  has  shown  that  the  parents  and  close  loved  ones  of  these  children.
We  crave  the  approval  of  our  peers  
I'd, like  you  all  in  the  audience  now  to  push  your  lower  jaw  forward, 
People  know, now  that  I'm  enthusiastic  that  I'm  a  happy  person  
He  maintained  a  calm  Insouciance  
We  can  categorize  it  like  that  
Because  you  might  say, well, this  type  of  surgery  might  be  regarded  as  cosmetic  
I'll  move  it  off  and  We'll  have  a  blank  slide  for  those  who  are  squeamish  amongst  you  
And  again, as  i  told  you, if  they  have  a  caring  family  and  good  work  life, then  they  can  lead  normal  and  fulfilled  lives.
So  It's, not  simply  a  western  phenomenon.
We  make  judgments  on  People's  faces.
Good-looking  people  are  always  judged  as  being  more  friendly.
This  is  an  image  of  ann  Who's  had  her  right  jaw  removed  and  the  base  of  her  skull  removed  
So  It's  very  valuable  to  have  that  tool  in  our  Armamentarium  
But  the  patients  are  going  to  have  to  take  drugs  that  suppress  their  immune  system  for  the  rest  of  their  lives.
We're  still  not  curing  enough  patients  --  It's  the  most  Disfiguring  cancer  
We  still  Can't  get  rid  of  scars.
Whereas  i  felt  that  when  you  design  you  either  improve  or  you  create  a  detriment  to  the  community  in  which  You're  designing  in  
Working  within  the  united  states, most  people  look  at  poverty, and  they  see  the  face  of  a  foreigner, but  go  live  --  i  live  in  Bozeman  montana  --  go  up  to  the  north  plains  on  the  reservations  or  go  down  to  alabama  or  mississippi  Pre-katrina.
So  in  the  past  seven  years  --  this  Isn't  just  about  nonprofit  
What  it  showed  me  is  that  There's  a  grassroots  movement, going  on  of  socially  responsible  designers, who  really  believe  that  this  world  has  got  a  lot  smaller, and  that  we  have  the  opportunity  --  not  the  responsibility.
So  It's  really  important  that  if  We're  designing  and  trying  to  create  change, we  build  that  change  
And  it  Wasn't  doctors  telling  us  this.
We  just  Don't  know  how  to  show  this  
And  on  the  fourth  week, the  doctors  come  and  they  Mow  out  an  area, put  a  tensile  structure  on  the  top. And  when  the  doctors  have  finished  treating  and  seeing  patients  and  villagers, you  cut  down  the  clinic  and  you  eat  it. It's  an  eat  your  own  clinic.
And  you  have  to  keep  the  maintenance  down  
And  so  we  decided  to  look  at  the  idea  of  sports  and  create  a  youth  sports  center  that  doubled  as  an  hiv/aids  outreach  center. And  the  coaches  of  the  Girls'  team  were  also  trained.
So  this  is  the  designer  He's  out  there  working  with  the  first  ever  Women's  soccer  team  in  Kwa-zulu  natal  siyathemba.
Video, well, my  name  is  Sisi  because  i  work  at  the  african  center.
This  was  a  connection, just  a  meeting  with  somebody  who  wanted  to  develop  Africa's.
This  is  a  370-dollar  shelter  that  can  be  easily  assembled  
Designing  housing, this  house  is  going  to  go  in  in  a  couple  of  weeks.
We  put  together  very  quickly, a  Washroom  
This  is  Shandra  and  the  Calhouns  They're  photographers  who  have  documented  the  lower  ninth  for  the  last  40  years.
One  billion  people  live  in  abject  poverty, 
If  we  do  nothing  about  the  housing  crisis  That's  about  to  happen  in  20  years, one  in  three  people  will  live  in  an  unplanned  settlement  or  a  refugee  camp  look  left. Look, right. One  of  you  will  be  there.
And  i  want  this  whole  thing  to  work  Multi-lingually  
The  idea  of  Needs-based  competitions  --  X-prize  for  the  other  98  percent.
We  also  want  to  look  at  ways  of  matchmaking  and  putting  funding  partners  together.
There  should  be  a  sheet.
So  I'm  going  to  speak  about  a  problem  that  i  have  and  That's  that  I'm  a  philosopher, 
And  i  get  Hoots  of  Derision  and  Cackles  and  Growls, because  they  think  That's  impossible. You  Can't  explain  consciousness.
My  late  Lamented  friend, bob  Nozick, a  fine  philosopher, in  one  of  his  books, philosophical  explanations  is  commenting  on  the  ethos  of  philosophy  --  the  way  philosophers  go  about  their  business  
I'm  sure  that  people  here  who  work  on  say, climate  change  and  global  warming, or  on  the  future  of  the  internet  encounter  people  who  have  very  strong  opinions  about  What's  going  to  happen.
But  with  regard  to  consciousness, people  seem  to  think  each  of  us  seems  to  think  i  am  an  expert  
No  other  ingredients  at  all  We're  just  made  of  cells  about  100  trillion  of  them  
The  content  --  There's  color, There's, ideas, There's  memories, There's  history. And  somehow  all  that  content  of  consciousness  is  accomplished  by  the  busy  activity  of  those  Hoards  of  neurons.
So  this  is  the  problem.
It's  one  that  i  predicted  in  the  last  page  or  two  of  my  1991  book  consciousness  explained  where  i  said, if  you  did  experiments  of  this  sort  You'd, find  that  people  were  unable  to  pick  up, really  large  changes  
And  as  i  walked  towards  the  picture, i  was  expecting  detail  that  Wasn't  there  
You're  familiar  with  a  more  recent  technology, which  is  --  there  you  can  get  a  better  view  of  the  blobs.
Now, what  does  your  brain  do  when  it  takes  the  suggestion?
I  Don't  think  so  not  a  chance, but  then  how  on  earth  is  it  done?
It's  the  same  thing: 
The  brain  Isn't  actually  putting  the  detail  in  your  head  at  all  
Is  the  shape  on  the  left, the  same  as  the  shape  on  the  right  rotated  
Yes, 
And  if  you  read  that  literature, one  of  the  things  that  you  really  have  to  come  to  terms  with  is  even  when  You're  the  subject  in  the  experiment, you  Don't  know, 
Well, That's  where  you  have  to  go  backstage  and  ask  the  magician  
How  many  of  you  see  that  sort  of  boundary  with  the  Necker  cube  floating  in  front  of  the  circles?
Can  you  see  it  
When  you  see  the  cube  one  way  behind  the  screen, those  boundaries  go  away  
And  i  supposed  that  that  was  just  a  flat  truth.
Let  me  just  pause  this  for  a  second.
So  now, We're  going  to  be  subjects  in  the  experiment.
Audience: yes, ,
So  155  seconds  is  the  median  time  for  subjects  in  his  experiment.
How  many  still  Don't  see  it, how  many  still  Don't  see  it  
Thank  you  very  much  
And  i  ever  met  more  humble  people, 
The  mosque  where  the  respectful  foreigner  is  showered  with  Blessings  and  with  tears  and  welcomed  as  a  gift  
What  do  we  know  about  the  women  10  years  after  the  war  
Well, the  thesis  of  the  bottom  billion  is  that  a  billion  people  have  been  stuck  living  in  economies  that  have  been  stagnant  for  40  years, and  hence, Diverging  from  the  rest  of  mankind.
The  last  time, the  rich  world  got  serious  about  developing.
Yes, you  tear  up  the  eleventh  commandment  --  national  sovereignty, 
We  need  to  be  at  least  as  serious  as  we  were  then  
The  commodity  booms  are  pumping  unprecedented  amounts  of  money  into  many, though, not  all  of  the  countries  of  the  bottom  billion  
So  a  mass  of  new  discoveries, 
Just  to  give  you  one  example, angola  alone  is  getting  50  billion  dollars  a  year  in  oil  revenue  
So  here  comes  a  bit  of  science, and  this  is  a  bit  of  science  I've  done  since  the  bottom  billion.
Come  back  15  years  later, 
You  know  how  rights  to  resource  extraction  are  being  sold  at  the  moment, how  They've  been  sold  over  the  last  40  years  
A  company  flies  in  does  a  deal  with  a  minister  
Thank  you  
I  was  an  unlikely  person  to  be  doing  this  
I  never  studied  sculpture  engineering  or  architecture.
It's  a  self-portrait  titled  wide  hips  
Returning  to  india  to  work  with  those  fishermen, we  made  a  net  of  a  million  and  a  half  Hand-tied  knots  --  installed  briefly  in  madrid, 
My  life  was  not  going  to  be  the  same  
Next  challenge, the  Biennial  of  the  americas  in  denver  asked, could  i  represent  the  35  nations  of  the  western  hemisphere  and  their  interconnectedness  in  a  sculpture?
I  read  about  the  recent  earthquake  in  chile  and  the  tsunami  that  Rippled  across  the  entire  pacific  ocean  
I  started  my  journey  30  years  ago, 
And  that  also  brought  me  to  the  fact  that  this  poses  such  a  risk  to  our  society  
And  together, they  only  form  about  15  years  of  supply  
But  now  we  have  a  real  technology  to  do  this  
When  they  control  their  brain, they  can  control  their  pain  
When  you  do, what  do  you  want  to  control  
You  will  be  able  to  look  at  all  the  aspects  that  make  you  yourself. All  your  experiences.
These  are  some  of  the  areas  We're  working  on  today  that  i  Don't  have  time  to  go  into  in  detail  
But  i  want  to  leave  with  you  the  big  question: 
We  are  the  first  generation  That's  going  to  be  able  to  enter  into  using  this  technology.
What  is  worth  dying  for  
We  know  that  It's  possible  to  live  in  a  failed  state, where  everything  that  can  go  wrong  does  go  wrong  --  where  mothers  Cannot  feed  their  children  where  strangers  Cannot  find  the  basis  for  peaceful  collaboration  where  people  are  murdered  indiscriminately.
For  instance, there  are  21  states  in  our  country  where  Corporal  punishment  in  the  classroom  is  legal, where  it  is  legal  for  a  teacher  to  beat  a  child  with  a  wooden  board, hard  and  raising  large  bruises  and  Blisters  and  even  breaking  the  skin  
But  we  can  ask  the  obvious  question: is  it  a  good  idea  generally  speaking  to  subject  children  to  pain  and  violence  and  public  humiliation  as  a  way  of  encouraging, healthy  emotional  development  and  good  behavior?
Now, many  of  you  might  worry  that  the  notion  of  well-being  is  truly  undefined  and  seemingly  Perpetually  open  to  be  Re-construed  
When  this  statue  was  carved, the  average  life  expectancy  was  probably  30  
Does  not  tempt  us  to  say  that  there  are  no  truths  to  be  known  about  human  nutrition, 
Many  people  worry  that  a  universal  morality  would  require  moral  Precepts, that  admit  of  no  exceptions  
And  yet  chess  is  a  domain  of  perfect  objectivity.
But  what  does  voluntary  mean  in  a  community  where  when  a  girl  gets  raped, her  Father's  first  impulse  rather  often, is  to  murder  her  out  of  shame.
Just  let  that  fact  Detonate  in  your  brain  for  a  minute, your  daughter  gets  raped.
But  if  we  are  in  a  reflective  mood, we  can  ask, is  this  the  perfect  expression  of  psychological  balance  with  respect  to  variables  like  youth  and  beauty  and  Women's  bodies.
Whenever  we  are  talking  about  facts, certain  opinions  must  be  excluded.
Paint  your  picture  of  what  rolling  the  clock, 50  years  forward, 100  years  forward, how  you  would  like  to  think  of  the  world  balancing  moral  progress  with  richness  
But  again, then  we  have  to  talk  about  well-being  in  a  larger  context.
Sam  this  is  a  conversation. I   would  actually  love  to  continue  for  hours.
We  Don't  have  that, but  maybe  another  time.
And  then  within  zoology, i  took  the  course  or  the  discipline  of  Entomology, the  science  of  insects  
Because  biological  control  phenomenon  you  can  see  it  in  your  backyard.
So  this  phenomenon  of  natural  control  exists  literally  everywhere, 
So  It's  everywhere, and  we  need  to  know  how  to  exploit  it.
What  damage  [does]?
Insects, those  Six-legged  organisms  and  spiders  or  mites, the  eight-legged  organisms  
On  your  right-hand  side, you  can  see  a  Cucumber  leaf  and  on  the  middle  cotton  leaf  and  on  the  left, a  tomato  leaf  with  these  little  Stipplings  
By  the  way, It's  Springtime  now, in  israel, 
When  temperature  rises  Sharply, you  can  see  those  bad  ones.
This  is  all  natural.
Again, We'll  start  first  with  the  pest, the  thrips  
This  is  a  sweet  pepper, which  is  not  Consumable, because  it  is  suffering  from  a  viral  disease  transmitted  by  those  Thrip.
Many  different  parts  
By  the  way, they  have  a  very  nice  landscape  --  you  see  the  Jordanian  mountains  on  the  one  hand, and  the  jordan  valley  on  the  other  hand  and  a  good  mild  winter  and  a  nice  hot  summer, which  is  an  excellent  condition  to  Mass-produce  those  creatures.
Here  we  come  with  those  natural  enemies  in  order  to  reverse  a  little  bit  of  the  wheel  and  to  bring  more  natural  balance  to  the  agricultural  plot  by  reducing  those  chemicals  
In  this  table, you  can  actually  see  what  is  an  impact  of  a  successful  biological  control  by  good  bugs.
But  if  we  go, for  example, to  this  place, southeast  israel, the  Arava  area  above  the  great  rift  valley, where  the  really  Top-notch  --  the  pearl  of  the  israeli  agriculture  is  located, especially  under  greenhouse  conditions  or  under  Screenhouse  conditions  --  if  you  drive  all  the  way  to  Eilat, you  see  this  just  in  the  middle  of  the  desert  
Step  by  step, it  does  narrow  
So  I'm, saying  it  on  behalf  of  all  the  Biocontrol  Petitioners  and  Implementers  in  israel  and  abroad, really  give  nature  a  chance.
How  can  we  understand  what  makes  some  societies  more  fragile  than  other  societies? The  problem  is  obviously  relevant  to  our  situation  today. Because  today  as  well, there  are  some  societies  that  have  already  collapsed  such  as  somalia  and  rwanda  and  the  former  yugoslavia  there  are  also  societies  today  that  may  be  close  to  collapse, such  as  nepal, indonesia  and  columbia.
What  is  there  that  we  can  learn  from  the  past  that  would  help  us  avoid  declining  or  collapsing  in  the  way  that  so  many  past  societies  have  
Why  did  they  all  end  up  dead? Well, in  my  five-point  framework, the  first  item  on  the  framework  is  to  look  for  human  impacts, on  the  environment, people  inadvertently  destroying  the  resource  base  on  which  they  depend.
Or  again, the  collapse  of  the  soviet  union  took  place  within  a  couple  of  decades, maybe  within  a  decade  of  the  time  when  the  soviet  union  was  at  its  greatest  power  
So  this  is  a  frequent  theme  societies  collapse, very  soon  after  reaching  their  peak  in  power, 
And  i  would  expect  that  if  our  human  civilization  carries  on  then  maybe  in  the  next  century, people  will  be  asking  why  on  earth  did  these  people  today  in  the  year  2003, not  see  the  obvious  things  that  they  were  doing  and  take  corrective  action.
One  blueprint  for  trouble  making  collapse  likely  is  where  there  is  a  conflict  of  interest  between  the  short-term  interest  of  the  decision-making  elites  and  the  long-term  interest  of  the  society  as  a  whole, especially  if  the  elites  are  able  to  Insulate  themselves  from  the  consequences  of  their  actions  where  What's  good  in  the  short  run  for  the  elite, is  bad  for  the  society  as  a  whole  There's, a  real  risk  of  the  elite  doing  things  that  would  bring  the  society  down  in  the  long  run  
So  That's, one  general  conclusion  about  why  societies  make  bad  decisions  conflicts  of  interest.
Instead  all  the  major  threats  facing  us  today  are  problems  entirely  of  our  own  making. And  since  we  made  the  problems, we  can  also  solve  the  problems  that  then  means  that  It's  entirely  in  our  power  to  deal  with  these  problems.
So  i  think  I'm, actually  the  first  one  here  --  i  lead  
And  meanwhile, i  use  nonsense  as  you  can  see  
This  was  one  of  a  series  called  Zany  Afternoons, which  became  a  book  
But  the  zeppelin  was  the  biggest  thing  that  ever  moved  made  by  man  
There's  moscow, Shirley, hope.
Those, for  example, are  mark  iv  british  tanks  from  1916  
Happy, little  story  Isn't.
Anybody  who  was  anybody  had  an  apartment  there?
It's, obviously, modeled  on  the  titanic  
I  thought, i  could  jazz  it  up  a  bit  have  a  little  fun  with  it.
This  is  the  word  side  of  my  brain  
And  then, when  it  ran  a  lovely  lady, an  old  lady  named  Mrs, edgar  Rosenberg  --  if  you  know  that  name  --  called  me  and  said, she  loved  the  cover.
Pretty  elegant, nothing  like  a  crash  to  end  a  joke  that  completes  my  Oeuvre  
Okay, I'm  going  to  show  you  again, something  about  our  diets  
There's, six  million  species  of  insects  on  this  planet.
There  was  an  estimation, a  conservative  estimation, a  couple  of  years  ago  that  the  us  economy  benefited  by  57  billion  dollars  per  year  
Small  animals  eat  insects  
And  here, you  see  me  enjoying  a  meal  with  caterpillars  Locusts  bee, Pupae  --  Delicacies, 
You're  eating  at  least  500  grams  per  year.
We're  even  doing  this  on  purpose, 
Now, the  situation  in  the  world  is  going  to  change  for  you  and  me  for  everyone  on  this  earth.
There  was  an  Fao  conference, last  october, that  was  completely  devoted  to  this  
And  we  eat  quite  a  lot  of  it  
In  the  developing  world, It's  much  lower  
So  if  you  would  be  an  entrepreneur, what  would  you  do?
I  gave  you  at  least  four  arguments  in  favor  
There  are  entrepreneurs  in  the  netherlands  that  produce  them. And  one  of  them  is  here  in  the  audience.
Well, in  the  netherlands, we  have  an  innovative  minister  of  agriculture.
Reset  the  three  minutes  That's  just  not  fair, 
I  would  still  be  on  my  bad  hip  that  was  so  disappointing  
Great, excellent, 
So  no, suddenly  i  Wasn't  averse  to  Butting  any  Geezer  off  the  list.
They  were  desperate  for  volunteers, because  the  average  age  of  the  volunteer  at  the  hospital  gift  shop  was  75  
So  next  thing, you  know, i  had  my  bright  blue  volunteer  vest.
I  Draped  them  casually  over  the  chair  in  the  Doctor's  office.
But  I'd  like  to  ask  you, how  would  you  tell  the  time  if  you  Didn't  have  an  iphone  
You  know, I've  always  wanted  one  of  these  
And  this  one, this  is  a  replica  from  a  15th-century  device.
So  tonight, if  It's  clear  You'll  be  able  to  see  the  summer  triangle, 
Step  three  is  identify  the  star  on  the  front  of  the  device.
He  would  know  what  time  the  sun  would  rise.
Probably  not  one  made  of  brass. He  would  have  one  made  out  of  wood  or  paper.
So  what  does  the  astrolabe  inspire  
And  what  we  gain  with  a  new  technology, of  course, is  precision  and  accuracy.
I'm  just  going  to  show  you  how  the  robot  works.
So  even  though  there  is  nothing  in  nature  that  looks  like  this, really, we  were  inspired  by  biology  and  applying  the  principles  of  walking  to  this  robot. Thus  It's  a  biologically  inspired  robot.
We  want  to  fold  up  the  legs  and  shoot  it  up  for  long-range, motion, 
We  developed  our  adaptive  gait, planner  
Welcome  to  Romela, the  robotics  mechanisms  laboratory  at  virginia, tech  
This  robot  is  an  amoeba  robot.
Robotic  air  powered  hand  with  elastic  Ligaments  
We  wanted  to  go  tackle  this  problem  in  a  very  different  direction.
So, for  example, in  iraq, you  know  the  war  zone, there  is  roadside  bombs.
We  actually  have  a  fan  club  for  the  robot, darwin  dynamic  Anthropomorphic  robot  with  intelligence, 
So  based  on  that  success, the  following  year, we  did  the  proper  mechanical  design, starting  from  Kinematics  
And  thus  darwin, i  was  born  in  2005  
Dennis  hong, so  there  is  actually  a  competition  called  Robocup  
We  were  the  very  first  team  in  the  united  states  that  qualified  in  the  humanoid  Robocup  competition, 
We  truly  believe  this  is  going  to  be  the  very  first  running  humanoid  robot  in  the  united  states.
How  do  we  develop  these  kinds  of  ideas?
We  have  a  fully  autonomous  vehicle  that  can  drive  into  urban  environments. We  won  a  half  a  million  dollars  in  the  darpa  urban  challenge.
We  also  have  the  World's  very  first  vehicle  that  can  be  driven  by  the  blind  
He  gave  a  talk  about  how  education  and  school  kills  creativity.
For  us  Roboticists, engineers  and  scientists  these  tools.
These  are  all  the  tools  that  we  need  
Bertie  county  is  kind  of  a  prime  example  in  the  demise  of  rural  america, 
There  are  more  buildings  that  are  empty  or  in  Disrepair  than  occupied  and  in  use  
He  was  brought  in  in  october  2007  as  the  new  superintendent  to  basically  fix  this  broken  school  system.
So  in  february  of  2009  dr  zullinger, invited  us  project, h  design  --  which  is  a  non-profit  design  firm  that  i  founded  --  to  come  to  bertie  and  to  partner  with  him  on  the  repair  of  this  school  district.
We  now  call  this  place  home  
But  beyond  our  personal  reasons  for  wanting  to  be  there, there  is  a  huge  need  .
It  allows  Elementary-level  students  to  learn  core  subjects  through  game, play  and  activity  and  running  around  and  screaming  and  being  a  kid.
So  the  first  batch  of  computers  are  being  installed  later  this  summer  and  We're  helping  dr  zullinger, develop  some  strategies  around  how  we  might  connect  the  classroom  and  the  home  to  extend  learning  beyond  the  school  day.
So  we  thought  what  if  you  could  bring  back  shop  class.
So  over  the  course  of  two  Semesters, the  fall  and  the  spring, the  students  spend  three  hours  a  day  every  single  day  in  our  4500  square  foot  Studio/shop  space, 
So  what  studio  h  might  offer  her  is  a  way  to  develop  skills, so  that  she  might  give  back  in  the  most  meaningful  way, 
So  for  him, studio, h  offers  him  a  way  to  develop  the  skills. He  will  need  as  an  architect, everything  from  drafting  to  wood  and  metal  construction  to  how  to  do  research  for  a  client.
And  going  out  into  the  community  and  interviewing  your  neighbors  about  what  kind  of  food  they  buy, and  from  where  and  why  --  That's, a  homework  assignment, 
Because  when  you  zoom  out  that  far  you  lose  the  ability  to  view  people  as  humans  
If  you  are  a  blind  child  in  india, you  will  very  likely  have  to  Contend  with  at  least  two  big  pieces  of  bad  news.
So  i  felt  that  i  needed  to  do  two  things.
Here's  the  eye  with  the  opaque  lens, the  opaque  lens  extracted  and  an  acrylic  lens  inserted  
In  fact, the  story  holds  true, even  if  you  have  a  person  who  got  sight  after  several  years  of  deprivation  
So  the  way  we  study  that  is  Let's, say, we  find  a  child  who  has  light  sensitivity.
And  We've  used  this  general  approach  to  study  many  different  visual  Proficiencies. But  i  want  to  highlight  one  particular  one, and  that  is  image  Parsing  into  objects.
So  any  image  of  the  kind  that  you  see  on  the  left, be  it  a  real  image  or  a  synthetic  image, It's  made  up  of  little  regions  that  you  see  in  the  middle  column  regions  of  different  colors, different  Luminances, 
And  nobody  knows  how  this  integration  happens  and  That's.
Doctor, what  are  their  shapes  
Doctor  now, 
So  we  are  creating  dylan, which  is  a  computational  system  with  an  ambitious  goal  of  taking  in  visual  inputs  of  the  same  kind  that  a  human  child  would  receive  and  autonomously  discovering  what  are  the  objects  in  this  visual  input  
Here's, what  a  Baby-cam  video  looks  like  
What's  amazing  is  that  working  with  such  highly  degraded  input, the  baby  very  quickly  is  able  to  discover  meaning  in  such  input.
Even  before  the  ball  gets  to  a  place, the  child  is  already  looking  there.
So  to  summarize  prakash  in  its  five  years  of  existence, It's  had  an  impact  in  multiple  areas, ranging  from  basic  neuroscience, plasticity  and  learning  in  the  brain  to  clinically  relevant  hypotheses  like  in  autism, the  development  of  autonomous  machine, vision  systems, education  of  the  undergraduate  and  graduate  students.
You  know, He's  thinking, what  am  i  getting  myself  into  
And  he  said, no, no, really, you  can  
And  no  disabled  person  had  ever  done  that  --  run  at  a  Collegiate  level.
It  was  really, really  hot  
And  It's, the  first  --  i  had  just  gotten  these  new  sprinting  legs  that  you  see  in  that  bio. And  i  Didn't  realize  at  that  time  that  the  amount  of  sweating, i  would  be  doing  in  the  Sock  --  it  actually  acted  like  a  Lubricant  and  I'd  be  kind  of  Pistoning  in  the  socket.
He  kept  me  on  the  right  track  
Everyone  was  taking  pictures  --  what  is  this  girl  running  on  
I'm  sitting  there  like, oh  my  god, oh  my  god, ,
So  they  call  us  out, and  you  know  --  ladies, you  have  one  minute  
And  i  had  to  think, why  did  i  do  this  
You  know, show  us  more  than  one  set  of  legs  
No  these  are  my  cosmetic  legs, actually  and  They're, absolutely  beautiful  
It  has  a  shock  absorber  in  it. So  it  like  Shhhh  makes  this  neat  sound.
In  these  
For  me  while  I'm  such  a  serious  athlete  on  the  track, i  want  to  be  feminine  off  the  track.
I  mean, i  love  the  fact  that  i  can  go  in  anywhere  and  pick  out  what  i  want  --  the  shoes. I   want  the  Skirts  i  want  --  and  I'm  hoping  to  try  to  bring  these  over  here  and  make  them  accessible  to  a  lot  of  people.
Two  weeks  ago, aimee  was  up  for  the  arthur  Ashe  award  at  the  Espys  
They  Didn't  even  want  to  touch  that  one.
What  We're  looking  at  here  is  the  insidious  cost  of  Ringtone  piracy, 
But  now  you  can  find  out  all  about  --  unfortunately, my  weight  is  a  little  higher  than  that, but  --  all  about  what  happens  
So  i  think, in  terms  of  the  fact  that  math  has  been  liberated  from  calculating  
It's  the  chore  
Computers  allow  us  to  do  that  --  and  this  is  not  a  small  problem  by  any  means.
That's, an  amazing  amount  of  human  endeavor, 
And  I'll  say, hmm, not  sure  I'll  think  about  it, roughly  
Well, one  of  them  is, they  say  you  need  to  get  the  basics.
That  somehow, if  you  use  a  computer  It's, all  mindless  Button-pushing, but  if  you  do  it  by  hand, It's  all  intellectual  
Might  have  been  50  years  ago, but  it  Isn't  anymore.
Why  are  we  using  computers  to  show  a  student  how  to  solve  a  problem  by  hand  that  the  computer  should  be  doing?
Same  principles: applied  --  calculations  harder, ,
So  the  problem  We've  really  got  in  math  education  is  not  that  computers  might  dumb  it  down, but  that  we  have  dumbed-down  problems  right  now.
So  if  you  go  through  lots  of  examples, you  can  get  the  answer.
So  programming  is  the  way  i  think  we  should  be  doing  that  
This  was  an  example, i  built  for  my  daughter  
You  can  see  that  this  is  a  very  early  step  into  limits  and  differential  calculus.
And  yet  That's  a  really  important  practical  view  of  the  world  
It's  like  the  land  and  the  king  They're  Inseparable, they  are  one  
The  contract  is  the  same  as  with  real  word  objects  in  real  world  containers.
And  finally  to  pull  out  all  the  stops, this  is  a  system  called  Urp  for  urban  planners  in  which  we  give  architects  and  urban  planners  back  the  models  that  we  Confiscated  when  we  insisted  that  they  use  cad  systems.
It  projects  down  digital  shadows.
There  are  Inter-shadowing  studies  that  children  can  operate, even  though  they  Don't  know  anything  about  urban  planning  to  move  a  building.
This  work  is  15  years  old  
And  the  great  thing  about  it  was  that  alex  was  so  dedicated  to  the  idea  of  Verisimilitude  the  idea  that  the  Putative  2054  that  we  were  painting  in  the  film, be  believable  that  he  allowed  us  to  take  on  that  design  work  as  if  it  were  an  R&ampd  effort.
And  the  result  is  sort  of  Gratifyingly  perpetual  
People  still  reference  those  sequences  in  minority  report, when  they  talk  about  new  Ui, design  ,
These  are  logistics  elements  that  are  scattered  across  the  united  states.
This  is  a  system  called  Tamper, which  is  a  slightly  whimsical.
We'll  go  over  to  jacques  Tati  here  and  grab  our  blue  friend  and  put  him  down  on  the  table  as  well  
Let  me  leave  with  one  final  thought.
Can  it  be  for  every  man, or  is  this  just  for  corporations  and  movie  producers, 
That's, our  goal  entirely  
So  this  is  the  inevitability  about  it.
I  just  like  to  dive  right  in  and  become, sort  of  a  human  guinea, pig  
It  was  a  wonderful  experience.
You  can  just  google, it  
As  i  say, in  my  book, I'm  jewish  in  the  same  way, the  olive  garden  is  italian  
The  first  thing  i  did  was  i  got  a  stack  of  bibles.
I  had  christian  bibles, 
So  i  wanted  to  follow  that  rule  
And  there  were  two  types  of  laws  that  were  particularly  challenging  
But  It's  a  big  part  of  the  bible.
I  wanted  to  see  how  dressing  biblically  affected  my  mind  
And  i  explained  my  project  and  he  said, well, i  am  an  adulterer. Are  you  going  to  stone  me?
They  really  did  a  fantastic  job.
I  wanted  it  to  be  about  religion  in  america.
So  this  was  very  inspiring  to  me  
I  recommend  jim  Wallis  and  tony  Campolo  
They're  very  inspiring  leaders, even  though  i  disagree  with  much  of  what  they  say, 
And  i  would  say, but  That's, crazy, 
The  key  is  to  pick  and  choose  the  right  parts.
There's  the  phrase  called  cafeteria, religion  and  the  fundamentalists  will  use  it  in  a  Denigrating  way.
You're  just  picking  and  choosing  
The  story  starts  in  kenya, in  december  of  2007, when  there  was  a  Disputed  presidential  election  and  in  the  immediate  aftermath  of  that  election, there  was  an  outbreak  of  ethnic  violence.
And  she  quickly  said, It's  too  much  
And  enough  people  looked  at  it  and  found  it  valuable  enough  that  the  programmers  who  created  ushahidi  decided  they  were  going  to  make  it  open  source  and  turn  it  into  a  platform.
And  it  represents  the  ability  of  the  World's  population  to  volunteer  and  to  contribute  and  collaborate  on  large, sometimes  global  projects  
And  once  They've  done  it, they  can  do  it  again, and  they  could  work  on  getting  it. Better.
Even  with  the  sacred  printing  press, we  got  erotic  novels, 150  years  before  we  got  scientific  journals.
So  before  i  talk  about, what  is  i  think  the  critical  difference  between  lolcats  and  ushahidi? I   want  to  talk  about  their  shared  source.
At  pick-up  time, the  teachers  who  have  been  with  your  children  all  day  would  like  you  to  be  there  at  the  appointed  hour  to  take  your  children  back  
Late  pick-ups  went  up  every  week  for  the  next  four  weeks, until  they  topped  out  at  triple, the  Pre-fine  average.
They  were  operating  with  social  constraints, rather  than  Contractual  ones.
It's  value  created  by  the  participants, but  enjoyed  by  society  as  a  whole  
The  goals  set  out  by  ushahidi  are  not  just  to  make  life  better  for  the  participants, but  to  make  life  better  for  everyone  in  the  society  in  which  ushahidi  is  operating  
We've  got  a  choice  before  us  
And  may  it  run  forever  because  it  gives  people  like  me  a  living  
There  were  two  sundays  in  between. But  of  course, sundays  are  church  days. So  you  Don't  play  on  sundays  and  one  day  it  Rained.
And  then  you  worked  out  your  strategy, and  you  came  and  fought  the  next  day, and  you  went  back  home  again, 
Take  a  look, you  could  play  it  in  the  dump  with  some  rocks  over  there. You  could  play  it  in  a  little  alley  --  you  Couldn't  hit  square  anywhere  because  the  bat  hit  the  wall  Don't.
As  you  can  see, you  can  play  anywhere  
And  we  won  this  world  cup  in  1983  
And  so  we  allowed  multinationals  into  india  
We  cut  customs  duties, we  reduced  import  duties.
But  what  a  game  we  had  m  s  Dhoni  got  it  right  in  the  air, but  Misbah-ul-haq  what  a  player  
A  massive  massive  success, india, the  world  Tt  champions  
So  it  was  a  different  india  
Now, all  of  the  sudden, if  you  were  to  bowl  a  shot  --  if  mumbai  were  to  bowl  a  shot, for  example, they  Needn't  go  to  Kalbadevi  or  Shivaji  park  or  somewhere  to  source  them.
So  he  played  in  hyderabad, went  straight  after  the  game, went  from  the  stadium  to  hyderabad  airport, sat  in  a  private  corporate  jet  --  first  refueling  in  portugal. Second  refueling  in  brazil. He  was  in  west  indies  in  time.
They  started  going  to  the  cricket  to  watch  shah  rukh.
For  a  long  time, india  was  this  country  of  poverty, dust, Beggars, snake  charmers, filth, delhi  belly  --  people  heard  delhi  belly  stories  before  they  came.
Hopefully  It'll  make  everyone  richer  hopefully  It'll  make  the  game  bigger, and  hopefully  It'll  give  cricket  commentators  more  time  in  the  business.
We  all  make  decisions  every  day.
And  surely, if  somebody  could  really  tell  us  how  to  do  exactly  the  right  thing  at  all  possible  times, that  would  be  a  tremendous  gift, 
This  is  what  statisticians  technically  call  a  damn  fine.
Calculating  odds  would  seem  to  be  something  rather  easy. There  are  six  sides  to  a  die.
It's  because  the  mind  Recalls  words  by  their  first  letter  ,
Why  in  the  world  would  anybody  ever  play  the  lottery  
Well, there  are  many  answers. But  one  answer, surely, is  we  see  a  lot  of  winners  right? When  this  couple  wins  the  lottery  or  ed  Mcmahon  shows  up  at  your  door  with  this  giant  check  --  how  the  hell  do  you  cash  things  that  size?
When  was  the  last  time  that  you  saw  extensive  interviews  with  everybody  who  lost  
You  Can't  say  to  yourself, I'm  as  likely  to  win  as  anybody  because  You're, not  as  likely  to  win  as  leroy  
Because  they  had  the  sense  that  declining  wages  are  worse  than  rising  wages.
Here's, a  $2000  hawaiian  vacation  package  It's.
This  tendency  to  compare  to  the  past  is  causing  people  to  pass  up  the  better  deal. In  other  words, a  good  deal  that  used  to  be  a  great  deal  is  not  nearly  as  good  as  an  awful  deal.
Now, just  in  case, You're  not  getting  it  Here's, a  schematic  of  what  happened. Ok, .
The  difference  is  that  when  you  lost  the  ticket, you  say, to  yourself, I'm, not  paying  twice  for  the  same  thing.
Nonetheless, their  predictions  are  perverted  by  a  comparison  that  then  does  not  carry  through  and  change  their  experience.
When  you  go  to  buy  Groceries  with  it, it  Doesn't  go  I'm  the  money  saved  on  the  car  stereo  or  I'm, the  dumb  money  saved  on  the  car, It's, money, 
And  if  a  drive  across  town  is  worth  100  bucks, It's  worth  100  bucks, no  matter  what  You're  saving  it  on  people  Don't.
Well  by  and  large, people  are  enormously  impatient  
Imagine  that  you  can  have  50  dollars  in  a  year  --  That's, 12  months  --  or  60  dollars  in  13  months, 
This  is  just  a  graph  showing  the  results  that  i  just  suggested  you  would  show  if  i  gave  you  time  to  respond, which  is  people  find  that  the  subjective  value  of  50  is  higher  than  the  subjective  value  of  60  when  They'll  be  delivered  in  now  or  one  month  Respectively  --  a  30-day  delay  --  but  they  show  the  reverse  pattern. When  you  push  the  entire  decision  off  into  the  future.
What  causes  the  bug  is  it? The  drama  of  the  event  --  that  It's?
I  Don't  want  to  say  --  please  I'm  going  to  get  quoted  somewhere  as  saying, terrorism  is  fine.
What  I'm  saying  is  that  surely  rationally  our  distress  about  things  that  happen  about  threats  should  be  roughly  proportional  to  the  size  of  those  threats  and  threats  to  come  
There's, no  question, ,
And  so  we  evolved  these  responses  
It  turns  out  that  the  value  of  buying  a  lottery  ticket  is  not  winning  
That's  what  you  think  it  is  all  right  
And  as  a  result, many  people  look  at  economists  as  stupid  people  
It's  the  sequel  to  an  inconvenient  truth, and  it  explores  all  the  solutions  that  will  solve  the  climate  crisis.
Or  we  can  scroll  through  the  pages  at  the  bottom  
Mike  Matas  and  so  throughout  the  whole  book, al  gore  will  walk  you  through  and  explain  the  photos.
This  photo  you  can  you  can  even  see  on  an  interactive  map, 
And  while  It's  playing, we  can  pinch  and  peak  back  at  the  page, and  the  movie  keeps  playing  
This  is  very  strange  for  me  because  I’m  not  used  to  doing  this. I   usually  stand  on  the  other  side  of  the  light, and  now  I'm  feeling  the  pressure.
So  We’ll  go  with  the  first  piece.
Court, i  Don't  want  to  get  rid  of  you  
Boy, look: man: reading  Don't, feed, no  one  
Boy, arguing  with  you  is  a  waste  of  time. Marcus: .
Marcus, when  a  man  Resorts  to  Profanities  It’s, a  sure  sign  of  his  inability  to  express  himself, 
Did  you  ever  move  your  Fuckin'  ass  from  hollywood  to  go  and  film, something  real  
The  first  piece  was  really  There's  a  young  woman  talking  about  nigeria, that  she  has  a  feeling  She'll, be  happy.
So  that  whole  thing  that  whole  childhood  echoes  and  takes  me  into  the  next  piece, 
Commander  soldiers  you  are  going  to  fight  a  battle, so  you  must  get  ready  and  willing  to  die.
C  success, the  change  is  only  coming  through  the  barrel  of  the  gun.
I  Don’t  remember  how  we  got  there.
The  injection  made  us  not  to  have  mind  
Various  voices, you  will  die. You  will  die. .
Onicha: ezra: 
Why  you  giving  these  to  me  
Mr  ezra  Gelehun: please  stand  
No, we  Don’t  
Mr  Gelehun  I'd, like  to  remind  you  You're, not  on  trial  here  today, 
You  are  not  on  trial.
E, so  you  are  a  liar  
Thank  you  
In  the  process  of  my  research, i  actually  spent  a  bit  of  time  in  sierra  leone  researching  this  
I  met  Psychosocial  workers  who  worked  with  them  
Frank  gehry: i  listened  to  this  scientist, this  morning  
I  mean, it  is  astonishing  for  an  artist  for  an  architect  to  become  actually  an  icon  and  a  legend  in  their  own  time.
And  i  realized  when  I'd  come  into  the  meetings  with  these  corrugated  metal  and  chain  link  stuff, and  people  would  just  look  at  me  like  I'd  just  landed  from  mars.
And  like  the  playwright  said, the  other  day  --  i  could  relate  to  him  You're, not  sure  
Yeah, 
There, Aren't, many  people  around  that  are  really  involved  with  architecture  as  clients  
If  you  think  about  the  world  and  even  just  in  this  audience, most  of  us  are  involved  with  buildings.
I  knew  craig  and  respected  him  
I  knew  You'd  ask  that  question, 
I  tried  to  understand  that  language  as  a  beginning  as  a  place  to  jump  off.
Siza  on  the  other  hand, continued  in  portugal, where  the  real  stuff  was  and  evolved  a  modern  language  that  relates  to  that  historic  language.
I  tried  to  get  him  a  couple  of  jobs, and  they  Didn't  pan  out  
Where  you  It's  like  jazz, you  improvise, you  work  together, you  play  off  each  other.
Richard  Koshalek  [unclear]  starts  from  2004  
You  can  come  to  the  opening  I'll.
I'd  seen  drawings  you  had  presented  here  at  ted  
They  came  for  three  days.
You've  all  heard  the  frank  lloyd  wright  story  when  the  woman  called  and  said, mr, wright  I'm  sitting  on  the  couch, and  the  Water's  pouring  in  on  my  head  
Rsw: Didn't!
What  do  you  bring  to  it?
That's  what  reminded  me  of  it  
Just  before  going  to  lunch  with  the  mayor, we  went  to  the  harbor  Commissioner, 
We  sat  down  and  we  had  a  drink  of  water, and  everybody  was  quiet  .
So  i  got  up  
They  just  brought  us  there  to  Hustle  this  group, you  know  to  create  a  project  
Because  i  want  to  get  a  standing  Ovation  like  everybody.
But  reliable  Dutchman  --  --  fantastic  
And  this  was  the  text  --  in  words  as  fashion  the  same  rule  will  Hold/  alike  fantastic  if  too  new  or  Old/, be  not  the  first  by  whom  the  new  are  Tried/, nor  yet, the  last  to  lay  the  old  aside,

That's, what  happens  
Silas, usually  has  a  better  touch  with  his  choice  of  quotations  
Don't  be  trendy  if  you  want  to  be  serious  
But  we  Don't  have  time  
There  were  10  artists  invited  to  participate  in  it. And  it  was  one  of  those  things  where  it  was  extremely  competitive. And  i  Didn't  want  to  be  embarrassed.
But  i  was  absolutely  stuck  on  the  idea  of  art  is  and  trying  to  determine  what  art  was  
We've  watched  the  financial  markets  that  we  uniquely  create  --  these  markets  that  were  supposed  to  be  foolproof  --  We've  watched  them  kind  of  collapse  before  our  eyes  
And  of  course, if  we  are  put  in  environments  where  we  Can't  deal  with  it, in  some  sense, makes  sense  that  we  actually  might  mess  certain  things  up  
It  feels  like  we  might  almost  just  be  built  to  make  errors  in  certain  ways.
So  this  is  the  question: my  students, and  i  wanted  to  get  at  
What  if  we  put  holly  into  the  same  context  as  humans  
Because  you  know, It's  great  for  us, but  bad  for  humans  
They  were  these  kind  of  weird  things.
So  the  monkeys  get  really  good  at  this  
The  monkeys  would  Rip-off  the  tokens  at  every  available  opportunity  --  from  each  other, often  from  us  --  you  know  things  we  Didn't  necessarily  think  we  were  introducing  but  things  we  spontaneously  saw  
We  were  a  little  impatient.
Sounds  great, but  you  get  one  more  choice  to  earn  a  little  bit  more  money.
Your  other  option  is  a  bit  safe, your  just  going  to  get  some  money  for  sure, 
So  see  what  your  intuition  is  here.
Most  people  say, why  should  i  be  risky  when  i  can  get  1500  dollars  for  sure  
And  now  imagine  that  i  have, you  make  another  choice.
They  actually  tend  to  go  a  little  risky  
And  this  means  that  sometimes  We'll  actually  switch  our  preferences  to  avoid  this  
What  you  saw  in  that  last  scenario  is  that  subjects  get  risky  because  they  want  the  small  shot  that  there  Won't  be  any  loss.
They're, why  stock  investors  hold  onto  losing  stocks  longer  --  because  They're  evaluating  them  in  relative  terms, 
The  question  we  were  interested  in  is  whether  the  monkeys  show  the  same  biases  
Sometimes  the  monkeys  get  no  bonus  --  so  this  is  a  bonus  of  zero  
Now, the  monkeys  meet  two  guys  who  Aren't  giving  them  bonuses  They're  actually  giving  them  less  than  they  expect.
So, you  know, a  little  bad  --  sorry, sorry, sorry, 
When  You're  watching  your  stocks  Plummet  into  the  red, when  You're  watching  your  house  price, go  down  You're, not  going  to  be  able  to  see  that  in  anything.
But  we  have  to  recognize  that  we  have  those  limitations  
We  have  this  great  north, and  there  was  a  pretty  small  population, and  my  father  was  an  avid  Outdoorsman  
But  what  i  think  it  was  telling  me  is  that  we  are  this  Transient  thing  That's  happening, and  that  the  nature  that  you  see  out  there  --  the  untouched  Shorelines, the  untouched  forest  that  i  was  able  to  see  --  really  bring  in  a  sense  of  that  geological  time  that  this  has  gone  on  for  a  long  time  and  We're  experiencing  it  in  a  different  way.
This  rebirth  of  grass.
So  There's, this  thing  that  is  pulling  me  in  both  directions.
But  We've  become  totally  disconnected  from  them.
That  if  we  keep  putting  things  through  industrial  and  urban  existence  back  into  the  system  --  if  we  keep  doing  that  --  we  can  continue  on  
Because  i  think  everything  that  We're  involved  in  --  our  clothing, our  cars, our  roads  and  everything  --  are  directly  a  result.
I'm  going  to  move  to  some  pictures  of  china.
So  this  created  a  reservoir  600  kilometers  long, one  of  the  largest  reservoirs  ever  created  
And  again, the  rebuilding  of  the  city  --  to  me, it  was  sad  to  see  that  they  Didn't  really  grab  a  lot  of.
This  is  a  shot  in  one  of  the  biggest  squares  in  guangdong  --  and  this  is  where  a  lot  of  migrant  workers  are  coming  in  from  the  country.
So  this  is  a  pink  uniform  at  this  factory: It's  a  shoe  factory, 
And  they  have  dorms  for  the  workers  
This  is  one  with  45000.
They  sit  down, they  have  about  20  minutes.
They're  not  getting  enough  so  They're  not  going  to  move  
Shanghai  was  a  very  intriguing  city  --  It's  exploding  on  a  level  that  i  Don't  think  any  city  has  experienced  
In  fact, even  shenzhen, the  economic  zone  --  one  of  the  first  ones  --  15  years  ago  was  about  100000  people.
So  this  is  three  of  the  visible  blast  furnaces  within  that  shot  
I  think  one  of  the  issues  that  we  here  are  facing  with  china, is  that  They're  using  a  lot  of  the  latest  production, technology, 
But  that  is  the  trick  that  They've  got  right  now  that  They're  winning  with  is  that  They're  using  all  the  latest  technologies  and  Extrusion  machines  and  bringing  all  the  components  into  play. But  the  assembly  is  where  They're  actually  bringing  in  --  the  country  workers  are  very  willing  to  work.
I  had  to  have  them  freeze  for  10  seconds  to  get  this  shot  
There  are  500  of  these  machines  They're  worth  about  200000  dollars.
So  you  have  about  12  people  running  this  and  They're  just  inspecting  it  --  and  They're  just  walking  the  lines.
This  was  one  of  the  biggest  factories  I've  ever  seen  
But  this  is  what  happens  to  most  of  the  computers  
And  as  much  as  there  are  great  things  around  the  corner  --  and  It's  palpable  in  this  room  --  of  all  of  the  things  that  are  just  about  to  break  that  can  solve  so  many  problems  I'm, really  hoping  that  those  things  will  spread  around  the  world  and  will  start  to  have  a  positive  effect.
Some  of  you  might  know, He's  a  tedster  --  stephen  sagmeister, and  i  are  working  on  some  Layouts. And  this  is  still  in  preliminary  stages. These  Aren't  the  Finals.
So  We're  looking  at  this  as  trying  to  build  out  
And  anything  that  you  can  do  to  promote, that  would  be  fantastic  
That  would  be  fantastic. So  those  are  my  three  wishes.
And  I'd  like  to  start  at  the  very  beginning  
The  more  stuff, That's  mine, the  better  
And  of  course, It's  your  stuff  if  It's  broken  
And  they  extract  the  metals  by  hand, 
So  about  20  years  ago, i  literally  started  in  my  garage, tinkering  around  trying  to  figure  out  how  to  separate  these  very  similar  materials  from  each  other, and  eventually  enlisted  a  lot  of  my  friends  in  the  mining  world  actually  and  in  the  plastics  world. And  we  started  going  around  to  mining  laboratories  around  the  world.
And  instead  of  Plopping  down, several  hundred  million  dollars  to  build  a  chemical  plant  that  will  only  make  one  type  of  plastic  for  its  entire  life. Our  plants  can  make  any  type  of  plastic.
We  use  a  very  highly  automated  process  to  sort  those  plastics, not  only  by  type, but  by  grade  
So  i  hope  I've  changed  the  way  you  look  at  at  least  some  of  the  stuff  in  your  life.
Mother, nature  wastes  very  little  Reuses, practically  everything  
And  i  hope  that  you  stop  looking  at  yourself  as  a  consumer  --  That's, a  label  I've, always  hated  my  entire  life  --  and  think  of  yourself  as  just  using  resources  in  one  form, until  they  can  be  transformed  to  another  form  for  another  use  later  in  time.
Now, it  was  not  always  wonderful  at  that  table.
In  fact, you  could  come  down  to  the  tree  to  get  your  gifts  and  get  ready  to  sing  and  then  get  ready  for  breakfast  without  even  taking  a  bath  or  getting  dressed, except  that  daddy, messed  it  up.
Now, That's, compassion, 
So  let  me  tell  you, i  kind  of  look  at  the  world, this  way, 
I  see  --  always  it  stirs  my  heart  --  a  picture  of  dr.
This  is  the  picture  they  said, It's  going  to  be  too  volatile  for  you  to  go  
We  are  so  connected  that  we  must  treat  each  other  as  if  an  action  toward  you  is  an  action  toward  myself.
And  whatever  else  is  needed, i  will  provide  it  and  pay  for  it  when  i  return  
This  always  seemed  to  me  to  be  a  deepening  of  the  sense  of  what  it  means  to  be  a  good  samaritan.
But  now  to  be  a  good  samaritan  --  and  i  always  say  and  to  be  a  good  american  --  for  me  is  not  simply  to  Congratulate  myself  for  the  individual  acts  of  care.
And  if  mama  eternal  has  taught  us  correctly, this  song  will  make  sense  not  only  to  those  of  us  who  are  a  part  of  this  gathering, but  to  all  who  sign  the  charter  for  compassion, 
I  just  want  to  say, my  name  is  emmanuel, Jal  
And  also  telling  it  like  now, 
And  also  the  easiest  one  was  when  i  was  doing  it  in  form  of  a  music.
I  wanted  to  revenge  for  my  village  
My  every  moment, 
Run  duck  play  dead  and  hide  
But  still, as  i  wonder, i  Won't  go  under  
I  was  ready  to  eat  
Give  us  tools  give  the  farmers  tools  
And  now  we  have  a  couple  in  university  
♫  what  would  i  be  ♫  ♫  if  emma  never  rescued  me  ♫  ♫  what  would  i  be? ♫   ♫  another  starving  refugee  ♫  ♫  what  would  i  be  ♫  ♫  if  emma  never  rescued  me  ♫  ♫  yeah, yeah.
We've  used  fear  if  you  like  to  grab  People's  attention, 
A  deer  freezes, very, very  still  poised  to  run  away.
And  i  think  That's  what  We're  doing  when  We're  asking  people  to  engage  with  our  agenda  around  environmental  degradation  and  climate  change  
And  unsurprisingly  people  all  around  the  world, say  that  what  they  want  is  happiness  for  themselves  for  their  families, their  children, their  communities  
Okay, they  think  money  is  slightly  important  
It  thinks  in  terms  of  how  much  bang  do  we  get  for  our  buck  
They  are  doing  that  on  a  quarter  of  the  resources  that  are  used  typically  in  [the]  western  world  --  a  quarter  of  the  resources  
What's  happening  in  costa  rica.
99  percent  of  their  electricity  comes  from  renewable  resources.
And  so  in  strict  Happy-planet  methodology, We've  become  less  efficient  at  turning  our  ultimate  scarce  resource  into  the  outcome.
A  child  entering  school  today  will  be  my  age  in  2050  
And  i  put  it  to  you  that  is  not  business  as  usual  
I  think  we  want  the  lot  of  humanity  to  keep  on  increasing  
And  the  point  of  these  is  they  are  not  quite  the  secrets  of  happiness, but  they  are  things  that  i  think  happiness  will  flow  out  the  side  from  
Keep  building  them  
The  second  one  is  be  active  
Based  on  a  lot  of  evidence  for  mindfulness  cognitive, behavioral  therapy, [very]  strong  for  our  well, being  
They  Don't  need  a  lot  of  material  goods  to  be  satisfied.
All  that  being  good  and  no  real  credit  for  it  
So  i  said, well, mom  and  dad, what  about  santa  claus  
Santa  would  come  to  our  house  while  we  were  at  nine  o'clock  high  mass  on  christmas  morning.
There's  only  one  obvious  conclusion  to  reach  from  this  mountain  of  evidence, our  family  was  too  strange  and  weird  for  even  santa  claus  to  come  visit. And  my  poor  parents  were  trying  to  protect  us  from  the  embarrassment. This  humiliation  of  Rejection  by  santa  who  was  jolly  --  but  Let's  face  it. He  was  also  very  Judgmental.
They  had  to  fit  two  criteria.
I  just  realized  that  the  age  of  reason  starts  when  you  turn  seven  and  then  You're  capable  of  committing  any  and  all  sins  against  god  and  man  and  bill  said, so, and  then  i  said, so, You're, six, you  have  a  whole  year  to  do  anything  you  want  to. And  god  Won't, notice  it. And  he  said, so, and  i  said, so  so  everything, and  i  turned  to  run, i  was  so  angry  with  him.
And  she  said, listen, the  cut-off  date  to  start.
So  i  took  the  bus  downtown  to  get  the  new  libra  poster  
Now  i  was  raised  in  the  pacific  northwest  around  a  lot  of  church  of  latter-day  saints  people. And  you  know, I've  worked  with  them  and  even  dated  them. But  i  never  really  knew  the  doctrine  or  what  they  said  to  people  when  they  were  out  on  a  mission. And  i  guess  i  was  sort  of  curious.
And  i  sat  them  down  and  i  got  them  glasses  of  water  --  ok, i  got  it.
And  they  told  me  this  story  all  about  this  guy  named  Lehi  who  lived  in  jerusalem  in  600  bc.
I  wanted  to  say, ok, Don't, start  with  this  story.
I  said, oh, come  on. I   mean, even  if  women  tried  to  have  a  baby  every  single  year  from  the  time, they  were  15  to  the  time. They  were  45, assuming  they  Didn't  die  from  exhaustion. It  still  seems  like  some  women  would  have  some  time  left  over  to  hear  the  word  of  god.
And  they  said, oh  --  hey, well, we  also  believe  that  when  you  go  to  heaven, you  get  your  body  restored  to  you  in  its  best  original  state.
Or  if  You'd  gone  blind, you  could  see  
If  someone  came  to  my  door  and  i  was  hearing  catholic  theology  and  dogma  for  the  very  first  time. And  they  said, we  believe  that  god  Impregnated  a  very  young  girl  without  the  use  of  intercourse. And  the  fact  that  she  was  a  virgin  is  Maniacally  important  to  us  --  --  and  she  had  a  baby  and  That's  the  son  of  god.
Yes, breast  cancer  
Overcome  with  the  enormity  of  it, all  and  the  complete  feeling  of  loss  of  control, i  shed  Copious  tears  and  asked  my  dear  husband, Jayant  ,
I  danced  between  chemo  and  radiation  cycles  and  Badgered  him  to  fit  it  to  my  performing  dance, schedule.
It's  the  power  of  bringing  ourselves  to  the  attention  of  something  that  so  animates  you  so  moves  you  that  something  even  like  cancer  becomes  insignificant.
It's, the  power  of  an  image  
Nobody  really  did  anything  with  it  pretty  much  
They  brought  all  sorts  of  different  computers  with  them  
So  that  in  all  that  diversity, if  i  wanted  to  figure  out  how  to  build  something  out  of  a  bit  of  this  and  a  bit  of  this  everything  i  looked  into, i  had  to  connect  to  some  new  machine. I   had  to  learn  to  run  some  new  program. I   would  find  the  information. I   wanted  in  some  new  data  format.
And  that  is  what  has  made  it.
They're  much  more  than  We'd  originally  imagined.
One  of  the  great  --  yes, a  lot  of  people  have  seen  it  --  one  of  the  great  ted  talks  
Hans  put  up  this  presentation  in  which  he  showed  for  various  different  countries  in  various  different  colors  --  he  showed  income  levels  on  one  axis, and  he  showed  infant  mortality. And  he  shot  this  thing  animated  through  time.
So  He'd  taken  this  data  and  made  a  presentation, which  just  shattered  a  lot  of  myths  that  people  had  about  the  economics  in  the  developing  world.
It  had  underground  all  the  data. Ok, data  is  brown  and  Boxy  and  boring  and  That's  how  we  think  of  it  Isn't.
In  this  case, hans  had  put  the  data  together.
We're  using  them  for  people  We're  using  them  for  places, We're  using  them  for  your  products, We're  using  them  for  events.
I  wrote  an  article  entitled  linked  data  a  couple  of  years  ago, and  soon  after  that  things  started  to  happen.
Ok, we  have  to  ask  for  raw  data  now, 
Practice  that  It's  important  because  you  have  no  idea  the  number  of  excuses.
The  people  who  are  going  to  solve  those  --  the  scientists  --  they  have  Half-formed  ideas  in  their  head. They  try  to  communicate  those  over  the  web.
And  that  is  what  linked  data  is  all  about  
You  get  this  really  huge  power  out  of  it.
Then  i  realized  that  what  i  was  getting  from  giving  was  a  narcissistic  hit  --  that  i  felt  good  about  myself.
Right  now, as  bill  mcdonough  has  pointed  out, the  objects  that  we  buy  and  use  have  hidden  consequences  
And  i  spent  a  couple  of  weeks  going  around  with  a  social  work  agency  that  Ministered  to  the  homeless. And  i  realized  seeing  the  homeless  through  their  eyes  that  almost  all  of  them  were  psychiatric  patients  that  had  nowhere  to  go. They  had  a  diagnosis. It  made  me  --  what  it  did  was  to  shake  me  out  of  the  urban  trance, where  when  we  see  when  We're  passing  someone  Who's  homeless  in  the  periphery  of  our  vision, it  stays  on  the  periphery.
One  day  soon, after  that  --  it  was  a  friday  --  at  the  end  of  the  day  i  went  down  --  i  was  going  down  to  the  subway.
And  anyway, the  next  morning, we  had  to  go  along  to  the  Jeweler  and  get  it  cut  off.
And  then, yes, all  these  other  ones  as  well.
So  i  suppose  You're  not  going  to  be  able  to  kick  me  off  the  stage.
So  just  help  us  with  some  of  the  numbers  
I  mean, how  big  is  the  group  overall  
No, i  mean, i  think  --  ca, but  is  that  your  hair  
Ok, 
Of  course, 
Yeah, well, 25  years  earlier, We'd  launched  the  sex  Pistols'.
Well, i  got  pulled  out  of  the  sea, i  think  six  times  by  helicopters  so  --  and  each  time, i  Didn't  expect  to  come  home  to  tell  the  tale  
But  the  ends  of  all  those  balloon  trips  were, you  know  --  something  seemed  to  go  wrong  every  time. And  on  that  particular  occasion, the  more  experienced  Balloonist  who  was  with  me  jumped  and  left  me  holding  on  for  dear  life.
Yeah, no, i  put  on  my  oxygen  mask  and  stood  on  top  of  the  balloon  with  my  parachute, looking  at  the  swirling  clouds  below  trying  to  Pluck  up  my  courage  to  jump  into  the  north  sea, which  --  and  it  was  a  very, very, very  lonely  few  moments  
The  years  --  and  until  i  stopped  looking  at  the  polls, you  were  sort  of  regarded  as  this  great  hero  in  the  uk  and  elsewhere  
Ok, this  Isn't  exactly  Hardball, ok, 
Didn't  --  Weren't, you  just  terrible  at  school  
And  generally  the  people  would  say, oh, well, That's  bad  news, 
Did  this  really  happen  
And  making  us  go  on  wonderful  long, bike  rides  
But  is  there  a  risk  here?
I  was  actually  prosecuted  under  two  quite  ancient  acts  in  the  uk.
We  changed  it  to  social  diseases, and  people  came  along  with  acne  and  spots, but  nobody  came  with  Vd  any  more  
And  john  Mortimer, the  playwright  defended  us  
So  seriously, is  there  a  dark  side?
There  was  a  nasty  biography  written  about  you  by  someone  
I  mean, do  you  think  about  life? Balance?
But  the  problem  with  capitalism  is  extreme  wealth  ends  up  in  the  hands  of  a  few  people  and  therefore  extreme  responsibility. I   think  goes  with  that  wealth.
And  is  there  a  risk  that  the  kind  of  the  business  heroes  of  the  west  get  so  excited  about  --  i  mean, They're  used  to  having  an  idea  getting  stuff  done, and  they  believe  profoundly  in  their  ability  to  make  a  difference  in  the  world.
But  i  think  business  leaders  can  bring  their  entrepreneurial  know-how  and  help. Governments  approach  things  slightly  differently.
Well, richard, when  i  was  starting  off  in  business, i  knew  nothing  about  it. And  i  also  was, sort  of  --  i  thought  that  business  people  were  supposed  to  just  be  ruthless, and  that  that  was  the  only  way  you  could  have  a  chance  of  succeeding.
So  i  would  like  to  thank  you  for  that  inspiration  and  for  coming  to  ted  today.
I  would  say, with  a  great  smile, i  will  definitely  pass  
He  just  started  asking, where  did  you  buy  the  radio  how  much  is  it  
And  he  said, oh, i  teach  at  a  college  of  arts  
It  can  be  ruins, or  it  can  be  music, or  it  can  be  painting  or  drawing  or  writing  whatever  it  is  
But  it  is  just  a  kind  of  trace  of  that  time.
So  it  took  about  24  hours  to  get  this  line.
So  what  we  see  is  just  what  we  think  often. And  most  of  the  time  we  Don't  see  what  it  is.
So  this  work  from  this  period  is, mostly  like  --  you  know, this  is  a  work  called  light  makes  dark  
This  is  an  exact  negative  
But  a  solution  arrived  after  being  quiet  and  not  working  for  about  six  seven  months  in  the  restroom  when  i  was  changing  the  air  Freshener  that  goes  from  solid  substance  to  vapor  
This  is  the  work  i  made  out  of  that  material.
So  i  told  them  I'd  like  to  start  an  air  Freshener  company, 
So  i  just  started  doing  this  work  to  inquire  further  about  how  to  sculpt  the  space  between  this  object, and  there  
Because  as  a  visual  artist, if  I'm  seeing  this  and  I'm  seeing  that  --  but  how  to  sculpt  this, you  know, 
It's  the  same  in  marketing  
It  only  took  one  robust  observation  from  copernicus  to  blow  that  idea  out  of  the  water.
Take  bp  --  they  spent  millions  of  pounds  over  many  years  building  up  its  credentials  as  an  environmentally  friendly  brand. But  then  one  little  accident.
The  same  is  true  of  marketing  
It  makes  this  distribution  of  energy, a  democratizing  force, which  is  ultimately  good  for  your  brand  
I  see  You're  all  up  on  the  history  of  hurdy-gurdy  --  Vielle, À , Roue, 
It's  also  the  only  instrument  that  uses  this  kind  of  technique  
And  today, the  hurdy-gurdy  is  used  in  all  sorts  of  music  --  traditional  folk, music, dance, contemporary  and  world  music  --  in  the  uk, in  france  in  spain  and  in  italy, 
But  the  moment  you  fall  in  love, you  become  extremely  sexually  Possessive  of  them.
But  the  main  characteristics  of  romantic  love  are  craving  an  intense  craving  to  be  with  a  particular  person, not  just  sexually, but  emotionally  
And  then  the  very  last  question, i  would  ask  them  --  i  would  always  have  to  work  myself  up  to  this  question, because  i  am  not  a  psychologist  
The  motor  of  the  brain  It's, a  drive  
And  in  fact, i  think  It's  more  powerful  than  the  sex  drive.
You  know, you  can  feel  it  when  You're  just  driving  along  in  your  car.
I  think  romantic  love  evolved  to  enable  you  to  focus  your  mating  energy  on  just  one  individual  at  a  time, thereby  conserving  mating  time  and  energy  
They've  got  incredible  people  skills  negotiating  skills, 
They're, highly  imaginative  
And  --  basic  math, 
We  are  seeing  the  rise  of  female  sexual  expression.
Indeed, arranged  marriages  are  on  their  way  off  this  Braid  of  human  life.
I  even  think  that  marriages  might  even  become  more  stable  because  of  the  second  great  world  trend  
It  may  decline  some  more  
Not  at  any  time  on  this  planet  have  women  been  so  educated  so  interesting, so  capable  
However, There's  always  kinds  of  complications  in  this  
In  these  three  brain  systems: lust: romantic  love  and  attachment  --  Don't  always  go  together.
But  i  want  to  tell  you  a  story  about  --  to  illustrate  
I've  been  carrying  on  here  about  the  biology  of  love  
And  Wasn't  that  rickshaw  driver, handsome  
These  circuits  are  deeply  embedded  in  the  human  brain.
They're  going  to  survive  as  long  as  our  species  survives  on  what  shakespeare  called  this  mortal  coil  
One  of  the  threads  that  seems  to  have  come  through  loud  and  clear  in  the  last  couple  of  days  is  this  need  to  reconcile  what  the  big  wants  --  the  big  being  the  organization, the  system, the  country  --  and  what  the  small  wants  --  the  individual, the  person  
Charlie  Ledbetter  yesterday, i  thought  talked  very  Articulately  about  this  need  to  bring  consumers  to  bring  people  into  the  process  of  creating  things.
And  That's  what  i  want  to  talk  about  today.

I  think  something  happens.
We  showed  them  the  whole  cut, and  they  were  all  completely. What  is  this  ?
And  the  point  is, when  you  lie  in  a  hospital  bed  all  day, all  you  do  is  look  at  the  roof  and  It's  a  really  Shitty  experience.
It's  a  history  of  invention  based  around  this  
When  we  actually  went  and  watched  this  procedure, taking  place  --  and  I'll  explain  this  in  a  second  --  it  became  very  obvious  that  there  was  a  human  dimension  to  this  that  they  really  Weren't, recognizing  
Why  do  we  line  up  the  square  milk?
Because  we  kind  of  have  to  --  We're  just  compelled  to  
We  Don't  know  why, but  we  do  
So  what  is  this?
So  what  seems  like  a  very  clunky  product  is, in  fact, incredibly  useful  
These  guys  are  using  this  very  successfully.
How  far  you  can  anticipate  what  follows  from  it? What  are  the  threats? What  are  the  possibilities?
And  all  the  components  are  there, which  are  now  in  common  Parlance  in  our  vocabulary, you  know, 30-odd  years  later, wind  energy, recycling  biomass  solar  cells, 
For  example, if  in  that  Bucky-inspired  phrase, we  draw  back, and  we  look  at  planet  earth, and  we  take  a  kind  of  typical  industrialized  society, then  the  energy  consumed  would  be  split  between  the  buildings.
If  you  compared  detroit  with  a  city  of  a  northern  european  example  --  and  Munich  is  not  a  bad  example  of  that  with  the  greater  dependence  on  walking  and  cycling  --  then  a  city, which  is  really  only  twice  as  dense  is  only  using  one-tenth  of  the  energy  
In  other  words, you  take  these  comparable  examples  and  the  energy  leap  is  enormous  
How  does  it  affect  the  design  of  buildings?
The  one  example, i  take  is  a  corporate  headquarters  for  a  company  called  willis  and  Faber  in  a  small  market  town  in  the  northeast  of  england, Commuting  distance  with  london  
This  building  was  wired  for  change.
In  other  words, we  Didn't  have  the  technology  to  do  what  would  be  really  interesting  on  that  building  
And  if  i  fast-forward  in  time, what  is  interesting  is  that  the  technology  is  now  available  and  celebratory, 
The  library  of  the  free  university, which  opened  last  year  is  an  example  of  that  
So  It's, not  a  kind  of  sacrifice  quite  the  reverse  
And  just  to  give  a  sort  of  glimpse  of  that  technology, the  ability  to  plot  points  in  the  sky  and  to  transmit  to  transfer  that  information  now, directly  into  the  factory.
For  wind  tunnels, we  would  literally  put  them  in  a  wind  tunnel  and  blast  air  and  the  many  kilometers  of  cable  and  so  on  
I  mean, major  transformation, 
It's  been  well  known  that  the  dead  sea  is  dying.
How  do  you  make  them  more  friendly  at  that  scale?
Hong  kong  i  refer  to  as  a  kind  of  analog  experience  in  a  digital  age, because  you  always  have  a  point  of  reference.
250  --  excuse  me, 50000  people  working  24  hours, seven  days, 
Contagious  is  a  good  word  
Laughter  is  contagious  passion  is  contagious  
And  that  directly  increased  student  Wellbeing  
And  that  Can't  happen  in  a  classroom  
And  ahmedabad  got  the  first  child-friendly  zebra  crossing  in  the  world.
Man, this  program  is  wonderful  
We  have  to  start  collecting  from  555  
Kbs, so  the  charter  of  compassion  starts  right  here.
It  was  incredible  
Now, i  was  paid  in  dollars  as  a  consultant, and  i  looked  at  my  income  tax  return  and  tried  to  ask  myself, is  there  a  line  in  my  return, which  shows  how  much  of  this  income  has  gone  to  the  people  whose  knowledge  has  made  it  possible  
I  tried  to  convince  myself  that  no  no, i  have  worked  for  the  policy. Changes.
And  this  was  a  moment  of  great  pain  and  trauma, because  i  Couldn't  live  with  it  any  longer  
In  fact, they  invite  the  honey  bees  through  their  colors  and  the  bees  Don't, keep  all  the  honey  for  themselves.
These  are  the  three  guiding  principles  of  the  honey  bee  network  that  whenever  we  learn  something  from  people, it  must  be  shared  with  them  in  their  language.
You  Cannot  discriminate  
I'm  so  sorry, to  say  that  
The  rice  that  you  ate  in  the  lunch  and  you  will  eat  today  is  transplanted  by  women, bending  in  a  very  awkward, posture, millions  of  them  every  season  in  the  paddy  season, when  they  transplant  paddy  with  their  feet  in  the  water  
And  feet  in  the  water  will  develop  fungus  infections, and  that  infection  pains, because  then  other  insects  bite  that  point  
And  this  is  what  he  got  painted.
There  could  be  nothing  more  wrong  than  the  Maslowian  model  of  hierarchy  of  needs  because  the  poorest  people  in  this  country  can  get  enlightenment.
So  Here's  a  model  where  a  Two-wheeler  washing  machine  
So  it  is  better. It  is  safer. It  is  affordable. It  is  energy-efficient  .
So, why  are  people  willing  to  adjust  with  that  mismatch?
For  example, cell  phones. We  have  400  million  cellphones  in  this  country.
Now, the  eminent  model, the  Long-tail  model  tells  you  that  small  sales  of  a  large  number  of  books, for  example, having  only  a  few  copies  sold  can  still  be  a  viable  model.
Look  at  what  he  is  doing  
But  he  has  modified  a  Two-wheeler  so  that  he  can  get  autonomy  and  freedom  and  flexibility  
And  we  have  a  very  vibrant  network  in  china, particularly, but  also  emerging  in  brazil  and  other  parts  of  the  world  
I  Can't  change  the  condition  of  the  road, but  i  can  make  the  cycle  run  faster.
And  this  is  a  donkey  cart, which  they  modified  
This  is  in  china, this  girl  needed  a  breathing  apparatus  
There's  a  whole  range  of  innovations  that  we  have  
A  car  which  runs  on  compressed  air  with  six  Paisa  per  kilometer  
And  he  Didn't  mean  the  comfort  of  a  Five-course  dinner, as  opposed  to  a  One-course  meal, but  he  really  meant  the  comfort  of  the  quality  of  the  building  for  the  people.
So  in  an  indirect  way, you  can  see  the  sun  
And  what  they  did  is  they  created  an  integral  building  element  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  space  that  surrounds  the  visitors  of  the  museum.
They  created  this  shade  that  you  can  see  here, which  actually  covers  the  sun, but  opens  up  to  the  good  light  from  the  sky.
They  allowed  themselves  a  few  mistakes  along  the  way.
This  is  richard  kelly  who  was  born  100  years  ago, which  is  the  reason  i  bring  him  up  now  because  It's  kind  of  an  anniversary  year  
He  meant  something  like  this  --  where  the  light  gives  direction  to  the  space, and  helps  you  to  get  around  
These  three  distinct  elements  together, make  a  lighting  environment  that  helps  us  to  feel  better  
How  do  they  share  their  culture  
The  problem  is, though  that  i  wanted  to  explain  to  you  how  this  really  works  --  but  i  can  have  four  of  these  on  my  finger.
So  just  to  explain  
Why  are  all  these  Motorways  permanently  lit  
Can  we  maybe  be  much  more  selective  and  create  better  environments  that  also  benefit  from  darkness.
Can  we  engage  people  more  in  the  lighting  projects  that  we  create  so  they  really  want  to  connect  with  it  like  here.
Where  have  they  come  from, where  are  they  going  
And  it  only  Embodies  all  these  stories  and  all  this  Suspense  because  of  the  darkness  and  the  light  
They  pointed  out  that  i  believe  it  was  between  30  and  50  years  from  today, they  will  be  steering  cars  by  wire  without  all  that  mechanical  stuff.
It  really  was  a  big  idea  in  technology  when  we  started  applying  it  in  the  Ibot  for  the  disabled  community, 
The  big  idea  here  is, i  think  a  new  piece  of  a  solution  to  a  fairly  big  problem  in  transportation  
For  instance, in  that  time, 91  percent  of  america  lived  either  on  farms  or  in  small  towns  
So  the  car  --  the  Horseless  carriage  that  replaced  the  horse  and  carriage  --  was  a  big  deal. It  went  twice  as  fast  as  a  horse  and  carriage.
It  all  made  sense  with  91  percent  of  the  people  living  there.
Three  million  people  die  every  year  in  cities  due  to  bad  air  and  almost  all  Particulate  pollution  on  this  planet  is  produced  by  transportation  devices, particularly  sitting  in  cities  
I  Don't  look  like  a  motor  vehicle  
We're  a  recreational  vehicle  that  Doesn't  really  matter. And  i  Don't  spend  my  time  doing  that  kind  of  stuff.
Then  she  looks  up  She's  looking  up, and  she  says  and  I'm, 81  years  old, and  i  Don't  drive  a  car  anymore.
We  need  water  
We  figured  out  how  to  put  a  Vapor-compression  Distiller  on  this  thing, with  a  Counter-flow  heat  Exchanger  to  take  the  waste  heat, then  using  a  little  bit  of  the  electricity  control  that  process  and  for  450  watts, which  is  a  little  more  than  half  of  its  waste  heat. It  will  make  10  gallons  an  hour  of  distilled  water  from  anything  that  comes  into  it  to  cool.
So  if  we  put  this  box  on  here  in  a  few  years, could  we  have  a  solution  to  transportation  electricity  and  communication  and  maybe  drinkable  water  in  a  sustainable  package  that  weighs  60  pounds.
We  tend  to  do  any  technology  that  we  think  is  sufficiently  important  We'll, typically, do  it  twice  once  we  want  to  do  it?
And  then  It's  time  to  do  it  again.
After  it  falls  below  a  critical  price, it  will  tend  if  It's  successful  to  rise  above  a  critical  mass, a  penetration  
And  maybe  you  have  reasons  for  starting  to  connect  them  and  bring  the  rest  of  your  entertainment  in  
This  is  a  fascinating  research  from  who  that  shows  the  effect  of  generic  drugs  on  Anti-retroviral  drug, compounds  and  cocktails  
Linux  is  another  good  example: 
Two  percent  Isn't, 20  percent. But  in  the  car  business, which  is  slow  moving  That's.
Free  is  something  that  comes  with  digital  because  the  reproduction  costs  are  essentially  free. It  comes  with  ip  because  It's  such  an  efficient  protocol.
It's, an  economic  force, It's, a  technical  force, 
You  know, there  could  be  a  Film's  [unclear]  there, but  It's, basically  every  song  ever  made  could  be  stored  on  400  dollars  worth  of  storage. By  2008. It  takes  that  entire  element, the  physical  element  of  songs  off  the  table.
Because  of  some  of  technologies  We've  been  talking  about  
And  by  definition, every  one  of  you  who  is  in  this  room  must  consider  yourself  a  global  soul, a  global  citizen  
Even  more  problematic, They're, not  listening  to  poor  people  themselves.
In  2002, i  met  this  incredible  entrepreneur  named  amitabha  Sadangi  from  india  Who'd  been  working  for  20  years  with  some  of  the  poorest  farmers  on  the  planet.
And  he  was  expressing  his  frustration  that  the  aid  market  had  bypassed.
But  the  market  also  had  bypassed  low  income  farmers  because  these  systems  were  both  too  expensive, and  they  were  constructed  for  fields  that  were  too  large  
In  fact, when  you  go  back  to  the  beginning, there  were  no  private  investors  who  would  be  willing  to  take  a  risk  on  building  a  new  technology  for  a  market  class  that  made  under  a  dollar  a  day  that  were  known  to  be  some  of  the  most  risk-averse  people  on  the  planet. And  that  were  working  in  one  of  the  Riskiest  sectors.
Secondarily  we  wanted  to  see  if  we  could  export  this  drip  irrigation  and  bring  it  into  other  countries.
In  arusha, tanzania, a  to  z, textile  manufacturing  has  worked  in  partnership  with  us  with  unicef  with  the  global  fund  to  create  a  factory  that  now  employs  7000  people  mostly  women  
So  that  in  the  terrorist  attacks  of  november, they  were  the  first  Responder  and  are  now  beginning  to  scale  because  of  partnership  
President  obama  understands  that  
It's, not  hyperbole  to  say  that  these  civil  society  institutions  and  these  social  entrepreneurs  are  building  real  alternatives  to  the  taliban  
It  was  about  115  degrees  
And  because  i  wanted  to  impress  you  all  with  slides  since  i  saw  the  great  presentations  yesterday  with  graphs, i  made  a  graph  that  moves, and  i  talk  about  the  makeup  of  me.
During  the  hurricane, you  had  Msnbc  posting  about  the  hurricane  on  their  blog  updating  it  frequently.
They  sent  a  search  party.
And  i  won  it, i  reached  all  of  these  people, and  i  had  tens  of  thousands  of  people  reading  about  my  life  everyday  
And  then  i  wrote  a  post  about  a  banjo  
And  my  husband  --  this  is  my  husband  who  is  very  hot  --  he  won  an  award  for  being  hot  --  --  he  told  me, you  Cannot  buy  a  banjo.
And  those  people  who  know  me  understood  my  joke, 
How  much  money  does  he  spend  on  beer  in  a  year  
And  then  i  got  people  saying  leave  him  
And  why  are  they  reading  this  
This  is  not  science. But  this  was  enough  for  me  to  be  really  so  interested  in  how  we  have  evolved  and  how  we  can  trace  our  line.
This  is  the  only  picture  i  have, and  to  think  of  what  we  have  the  ability  to  do  with  our  blogs  to  think  about  the  people  who  are  on  those  $100  computers  talking  about  who  they  are  sharing  these  personal  stories  --  this  is  an  amazing  thing.
And  --  and  so  i  printed  out  her  --  or  i  sent  a  Pdf  of  her  blog  to  her  family, and  they  passed  it  out  at  her  memorial  service, and  even  in  her  obituary, they  mentioned  her  blog  because  it  was  such  a  big  part  of  her  life.
You  can  see  in  its  shape  and  its  Streamlined  design  It's, powered  for  ocean  swimming  
It  flies  through  the  ocean  on  its  Pectoral  fins  gets  lift  powers  its  movements  with  a  Lunate  tail.
This  tuna  symbolizes  What's, the  problem  for  all  of  us  in  the  room  
So  take  a  look  at  that  animal  
So  in  a  program  called  Tag-a-giant  We've  actually  gone  from  ireland  to  canada  from  Corsica  to  spain  ,
And  That's  the  fisheries  off  the  state  of  north  carolina, 
They're  coming  together  that  could  be  tuna  sex  --  and  there  it  is  
So  from  data, like  this  We're  able  now  to  put  the  map  up  and  in  this  map, you  see  thousands  of  positions  generated  by  this  decade  and  a  half  of  tagging  
Salmon  sharks  go  down  to  the  tropics  to  pup  and  come  into  monterey  
We  just  need  to  put  it  together.
We  have  the  technology  That's, shown  us  where  it  is  
Hi  there  I'm  hasan  I'm, an  artist  
Basically  this  is  the  fbi  offices  in  tampa, where  i  spent  six  months  of  my  life  --  back  and  forth, not  six  months  continuously.
Or  questions  such  as  --  actually  during  the  Polygraph, which  was  how  it  finally  ended  after  nine  consecutive  of  them  --  one  of  the  Polygraph  questions  was  
And  It's  like  guys, i  travel  a  lot  
Don't  want  to  make  it  look  like  I'm, making  any  sudden  moves  
And  so  i  just  kept  doing  this  over  and  over  and  over  
Then  I'd  make  websites  
So  you  can  see  delta  1252  going  from  kansas  city  to  atlanta  
This  was  on  delta  719, going  from  jfk  to  san  francisco, 
These  are  the  airports  that  i  hang  out  in  because  i  like  airports  ,
But  if  you  can  Cross-reference  this  with  the  other  data, then  You're  basically  Replaying  the  roll  of  the  fbi  agent  and  putting  it  all  together  
This  is  exactly  where  my  old  apartment  in  san  francisco  was  
And  then, sometimes  you  get  this  
So  There's  multiple  databases, 
So  There's  different  Categorizations  of  meals  eaten  outside  empty  train  stations  empty  gas  stations.
At  156  Pm  was  this  one  at  459  Pm  was  this  one  
Every  few  moments  i  shoot  the  image, 
So  by  me, putting  all  this  information  out  there, what  I'm  basically  telling  you  is  I'm  telling  you  everything  
And  the  reason  their  information  has  any  value  is  well, because  no  one  else  has  access  to  it.
And  by  me, cutting  out  the  middle  man  and  giving  it  straight  to  you  the  information  that  the  fbi  has  has  no  value.
So  in  a  way, I'm  glad  that  I'm  completely  obsolete, 
And  you  know, some  of  my  friends  have  always  said, hey, You're, just  paranoid.
So  you  can  see  that  the  homeland  security  likes  to  come  by  --  department  of  homeland  security.
Bruno  giussani: hasan  just  curious  
So  It's  just  become  another  day.
And  Everything's  automated  at  the  other  end, 
On  the  day  you  are  in  a  place  where  there  is  no  coverage, the  fbi  gets  crazy  
Well, it  goes  to  the  last  point  that  i  was  at  
Hasan, thank  you  very  much.
You  all  know  the  truth  of  what  I'm  going  to  say, 
But  first  see  what  a  miserable  lot  we  are  
Even  the  people  just  below  the  top  have  less  good  health  than  the  people  at  the  top  
And  there  you  see  it  in  relation  to  the  measure  of  inequality  I've  just  shown  you, which  i  shall  use  over  and  over  again  in  the  data  
That's  very  important  in  poorer  countries, but  not  in  the  rich  developed  world, 
But  in  the  more  equal  societies, it  rises  to  60  or  65  percent  
This  is  violence, 
There's  a  about  a  tenfold  difference.
But  it  goes  from  about  40  to  400  people  in  prison  
Basically  It's  asking  do  rich  fathers  have  rich  sons  and  poor  fathers  have  poor  sons, or  is  there  no  relationship  between  the  two  
One  is  that  in  graph  after  graph, we  find  the  countries  that  do  worse, whatever  the  outcome  seem  to  be  the  more  unequal  ones, and  the  ones  that  do  well  seem  to  be  the  nordic  countries  and  japan  
It's, not  just  one  or  two  things  that  go  wrong.
I  am  not  talking  about  perfect  equality, I'm, talking  about  what  exists  in  rich  developed  market.
It  also  leads  to  status  insecurity, 
The  big  change  in  our  understanding  of  drivers  of  chronic  health  in  the  rich  developed  world  is  how  important  chronic  stress  from  social  sources  is  affecting  the  immune  system.
Thank  you  
Well, i  Didn't  have  that  in  mind.
The  acid  will  ruin  the  gold  Plating  
Beneath  it  is  a  wonderful  knife.
No, but  is  it  fun? ?
So  i  type  design  emotion  and  my  website  Wasn't  first, again, 
It's  so  much  fun  to  drive  
And  then  a  psychologist  alice  Isen  did  this  wonderful  experiment  
So  She'd  bring  people  into  the  room  and  There'd  be  a  string  hanging  down  here  and  a  string  hanging  down  here.
You  get  a  little  problem.
There's, an  amazing  amount  of  stuff  That's  built  into  the  brain  
Behavioral  is  subconscious, You're  unaware  of  it.
Almost  everything  we  do  is  subconscious  
And  the  tea  is  sitting  in  this  stuff  to  the  right  --  the  tea  is  to  the  right  of  this  line.
And  the  reason  you  might  buy  it  now  is  because  you  care  about  the  environment, 
The  other  neat  thing, 
So  That's, the  new  me, 
The  graph  was  interesting, although  you  need  to  consider  it  carefully, 
It  did  not  correlate  with  the  size  of  classrooms  
If  you  took  the  same  technology  and  piloted  it  into  one  of  those  remote  schools  where  the  score  was  30  percent  and  Let's  say  took  that  up  to  40  percent  --  that  will  be  a  completely  different  thing.
The  last  question  is  what  everybody  said, but, you  know, i  mean, they  must  have  poked  their  head  over  the  wall  and  asked  the  people  in  your  office. Can  you  show  me  how  to  do  it?
He  came  there, and  he  started  to  fiddle  around  with  the  touchpad  
I  left  the  computer  there  with  lots  of  cds  --  i  Didn't  have  any  internet  --  and  came  back  three  months  later, 
And  as  soon  as  they  saw  me, they  said, we  need  a  faster  processor  and  a  better  mouse  
So  i  said, but  how  did  you  understand  What's  going  on  over  there?
So  then  i  measured  and  they  were  using  200  english  words  with  each  other  --  Mispronounced, but  correct  usage  --  words  like  exit, stop  find  save  that  kind  of  thing, not  only  to  do  with  the  computer, but  in  their  day-to-day  conversations  
This  is  the  himalayas  up  in  the  north, very  cold  
I  want  to  just  cut  this  short, we  did  this  over  and  over  again, 
So  if  they  have  access  to  the  computer, they  will  teach  themselves  including  intelligence.
But  we  got  a  clean  learning  curve, almost  exactly  the  same  as  what  you  would  get  in  a  school.
I'll  leave  it  at  that. Because  i  mean, it  sort  of  says  it  all  Doesn't.
An  educational  technology  and  Pedagogy  that  is  digital  automatic, Fault-tolerant, Minimally, invasive  connected  and  Self-organized  
And  It's  about  rediscovering  idealism  in  all  of  that  Wreckage  
I  negotiated  with  Saddam's  diplomats  at  the  Un  
I'd  already  served  in  germany, norway  various  other  places. But  i  was  posted  to  new  york  to  serve  on  the  Un  security  council  for  the  british  delegation.
And  there  i  dealt  with  things  like  the  middle  east  peace  process, the  Lockerbie  issue  --  we  can  talk  about  that  later, if  you  wish  --  but  above  all, my  responsibility  was  iraq  and  its  weapons  of  mass  destruction  and  the  sanctions  we  placed  on  iraq  to  oblige  it  to  Disarm  itself  of  these  weapons.
I  decided  to  take  a  sabbatical.
So  took  a  running  leap  and  jumped  over  the  edge  of  a  cliff  
But  in  a  way, I've  got  used  to  the  sensation  of  it  
A  lot  of  my  friends  were  still  in  it.
It  was  anarchy  
And  It's  a  very  horrible  thing  to  see  anarchy  to  know  that  the  police  and  the  military  --  there  were  lots  of  military  troops  there  --  actually  Can't  stop  that  Rampaging  mob  Who's  coming  down  the  street.
They  were  not  allowed  a  foreign  office  to  help  them  deal  with  this  immensely  complicated  process, which  became  known  as  the  final  status  process  of  kosovo  
And  i  came  to  kosovo  and  advised  the  kosovo  government  
If  they  Can't  do  it  Who's  left  to  deal  with  it  
So  we  will  be  bringing  Darfuri  rebel  groups, the  northern  Cypriots  and  the  southern  Cypriots  rebels  from  Aceh  and  awful, long, laundry  list  of  chaotic  conflicts  around  the  world.
That  is  the  politics  of  the  21st  century, and  in  a  way, independent  diplomat, Embodies  that  fragmentation, that  change  that  is  happening  to  all  of  us.
Now  today, We're  not  talking  about  good  and  bad  tv  
This  is  something  that  clearly  separates  us  from  the  animal  kingdom.
Is  television, literally, functioning  as  our  conscience  tempting  us  and  rewarding  us  at  the  same  time.
We  surveyed  the  Top-20  Nielsen  shows  every  year  for  50  years  --  a  thousand  shows  
Viewers  had  responded  dramatically  
This  was  the  first  show  that  allowed  viewers  to  say  my  god, i  can  comment  on  how  i  feel  about  the  vietnam  war  about  the  presidency  through  television  
It  can  change  us  
That's  mapped  against  the  red  dot  unemployment, which  is  a  simple  bureau  of  labor  department  statistic  
We  had  the  bursting  of  the  tech  bubble  
I  can  vote  you  off  the  island, 
There  has  not  been  a  decade  of  television  without  a  definitive, dominant  tv, mom, 
Maude  Findlay, the  epitome  of  the  irreverent  1970s  who  Tackled  abortion  divorce  even  menopause  on  tv  
Murphy  brown  took  on  a  vice  president  when  she  took  on  the  idea  of  single  Parenthood  
This  Era's, mom, Bree  van  de  Kamp  
So  Here's, the  metaphor  I'm  offering  today, 
Previous  to  this  time, i  was  very  selfish  and  Self-righteous  
And  on  this  higher  level, he  becomes  loving  and  Forgiving  
But  Here's  the  Weirdest  place  of  all  war  
I  passes  Insensibly  into  a. We  my  becomes  our  and  individual  faith  loses  its  central  importance.
Now, profane  is  the  opposite  of  sacred  
It  just  means  ordinary  or  common  
Durkheim  believed  that  anything  that  unites  us  takes  on  an  air  of  sacredness.
I'm  offering  the  metaphor  of  a  staircase  in  the  mind  
So  Here's, the  million-dollar  question  for  social  scientists, like  me, is  the  staircase, a  feature  of  our  evolutionary  design  
Or  is  it  a  bug? A   mistake  in  the  system  --  this  religious  stuff  is  just  something  that  happens  when  the  wires  cross  in  the  brain  --  jill  has  a  stroke, and  she  has  this  religious  experience. It's, just  a  mistake.
There's  a  mutation  in  the  gene  and  one  of  them  mutates  to  follow  a  selfish  strategy.
It's  so  big  and  powerful  and  efficient  that  it  can  take  resources  from  the  greens  from  the  Defectors, the  cheaters  
And  pretty  soon  the  whole  population  is  actually  composed  of  these  new.
We're  not  locked  into  cooperation, the  way  bees  and  ants  are  
We're  bees, we  busted  out  of  the  hive  during  the  enlightenment.
We  unleashed  Earth-changing  creativity  and  generated  vast  wealth  and  comfort  
What's  missing  
And  that  gives  me  hope  because  people  are  not  purely  selfish.
Every  man  is  a  piece  of  the  continent, a  part  of  the  main  
Thank  you  
There  was  no  more  space  in  the  house. So  i  went  out  to  the  backyard  and  without  any  previous  building  experience  and  about  3000  dollars  and  some  recycled  materials. I   built  this  space.
There  was  enough  space, and  i  had  control  which  was  very  important  
He  won  the  silver  medal  for  ireland  in  the  1992  olympics, and  he  trains  in  this  space, he  trains  other  people, 
Museum  quality  
I  had  Requested  slides  kind  of  Adamantly  up  till  the  --  pretty  much  last  few  days, but  was  denied  access  to  a  slide  projector.
These  are  a  couple  of  garage  doors  painted  identical  situated  next  to  each  other  
So  Here's  the  first  door, you  know, you  get  the  message  
This  is  for  a  book  by  metropolis.
When  i  first  contacted  william  burroughs  about  being  part  of  it, he  said, no, he  said, he  Didn't  believe.
And  also  surprisingly, it  was  done  in  kind  of  a  cheap  metal, and  it  had  completely  rusted  through  and  water  everywhere  and  spiders  
And  i  thought, you  know, what  were  they  thinking  
Got  no  way  of  tracking  it. So  i  could  be  totally  wrong.
I  Don't  have  the  site  It's, just  the  piece  itself.
I  found  out  That's  very  true  working  on  this  campaign  worldwide, 
But  anyway, this  is  one  of  the  ads  i  was  most  pleased  with  because  they  were  all  Elaborately  Art-directed. And  this  one, i  thought, actually  felt  like  the  girl  was  looking  at  the  computer.
In  germany, they  made  one  small  change  without  checking  with  me  --  nor  did  they  have  to  because  it  was  done  through  agencies  --  but  see  if  you  can  tell  the  difference  
So  i  understand  their  logic, i  totally  disagree  with  it. I   think  It's  a  very  Small-minded  approach. The  world  is  certainly  much  more  global.
Article  on  Bryan  ferry  --  just  really  boring  article  --  so  i  set  the  whole  article  in  Dingbat  
It's  kind  of  Horsey  type, but  the  texture  --  the  second  plane, not  quite  hitting. There  was  something  more  Enticing.
It  did  not  let  up  
There  were  a  lot  of  orphans  made  this  day  and  Here's  a  dead  body, being  brought  out  
This  is  my  desktop  
This  is  --  i  like  found  art  hand  Lettering's  coming  back  in  a  big  way.
But  i  was  asked  to  give  a  talk  at  a  conference  in  sacramento  a  few  years  back  
And  i  remembered  seeing  this  photograph  of  my  father, who  was  a  test  pilot. And  he  told  me  that  when  you  signed  up  to  become  a  test  pilot, they  told  you  that  there  was  a  40  to  50  percent  chance  of  death  on  the  job.
I've  spent  the  past  year  thinking  about  what  it  really  should  be  about  
Before  that  obviously  technology  Didn't  exist.
But  It's  still  very, very  productive. So  I'm  attempting  to  say, if  we  take  Technology's  view  of  the  world, what  does  it  want?
And  i  think, once  we  ask  that  question, we  have  to  go  back  actually  to  life, because  obviously, if  we  keep  extending  the  origins  of  technology  far  back, i  think  we  come  back  to  life  at  some  point.
Brian  Farrell's  work  is  all  part  of  this  agenda  to  try  and  actually  discover  all  the  species  on  earth  
More  and  more  of  the  inert  matter  of  the  globe  is  being  touched  and  animated  by  life  
And  the  last  thing  i  bring  back  this  Nudibranch  
And  so  the  general  long-term  trends  of  evolution  are  roughly  these  five  Ubiquity  diversity, specialization, complexity  and  socialization. Now  i  took  that  and  said, ok, what  are  the  long-term  trends  in  technology?
That  we  see  There's  a  general  hammer  and  hammers  become  more  and  more  specific  over  time.
There's  obviously  diversity, huge  numbers  of  things.
So  the  major  trends  in  technology, evolution  actually  are  the  same  as  in  biological  evolution. The  same  drives  that  we  see  towards  Ubiquity  towards  diversity  towards  socialization  towards  complexity. That  is  maybe  not  a  big  surprise. Because  if  we  map  out  say, the  evolution  of  armor, you  can  actually  follow  a  sort  of  an  Evolutionary-type  Cladistic  tree.
He  has  one  of  the  World's  largest  collections  --  about  500  of  them  
But  the  most  interesting  aspect  about  this  is  that  if  you  look  at  those  red  lines  at  the  bottom, those  indicate  basically  a  Parentage  of  a  type  of  Cornet  that  was  no  longer  made  that  does  not  happen  in  biology.
And  when  we  take  that, we  take  this  idea  of  what  culture  is  doing  and  add  it  to  what  the  long-term  trajectory  --  again, in  Life's  evolution  --  we  find  that  each  case  --  each  of  the  major  transitions  in  life  --  what  They're  really  about  is  accelerating  and  changing  the  way  in  which  evolution  happens.
So  all  these  steps  in  evolution  are  increasing, basically  the  evolution  of  Evolvability  
So  if  you  have  life  hacking  --  life  means  hacking  the  game  of  survival  --  then  evolution  is  a  way  to  extend  the  game  by  changing  the  rules  of  the  game.
And  each  time  we  make  a  new  opportunity  place, We're  allowing  a  platform  to  make  new  ones.
That's, what  technology  wants  
I'm  going  my  gosh, i  had  never  seen  anything  like  this  in  my  life.
And  you  walk  up  to  the  front  of  the  tank, then  you  realize  that  these  animals  all  have  different  personalities, some  of  them  would  hold  their  ground. Others  would  Slink  into  the  back  of  the  tank  and  disappear  in  the  rocks.
And  what  i  learned  in  school  though  was  really  beneficial  
If  You're  a  wildlife  filmmaker  and  You're  going  out  into  the  field  to  film  animals  especially  behavior, it  helps  to  have  a  fundamental  background  on  who  these  animals  are  how  they  work.
So  we  created  a  way  to  find  out, and  i  got  my  first  look  at  that  famous  beak  in  action, 
And  octopus  are  they  live  in  all  the  oceans  
And  as  you  go  deeper  that  lovely  blue  water, you  were  launched  in  gives  way  to  darker  and  darker  blue  
And  finally, It's  a  rich  Lavender, and  after  a  couple  of  thousand  feet  It's, ink, black  
But  We're  just  going  to  zip  right  past  this  area, this  area  that  includes  about  95  percent  of  the  living  space  on  our  planet  and  go  to  the  mid-ocean  ridge, which  i  think  is  even  more  extraordinary  
And  the  top  of  this  mountain  range  is  splitting  apart  creating  a  rift  valley.
The  surrounding  water  is  just  a  couple  of  degrees  above  freezing  
And  this  kind  of  life  and  death  of  hydrothermal  vent  communities  is  going  on  every  30  or  40  years, all  along  the  ridge  
But  Encouragingly  I've  seen  just  the  opposite  
Well, how  it  happened  is  the  local  community, Galvanized  
And  these  problems  are  so  large  and  global  and  It's  just  overwhelming  
My  answer  to  that  is  Don't, look  at  the  big  overwhelming  issues  of  the  world.
And  we  can  make  changes  to  our  behavior  that  will  influence  and  affect  the  environment  like  those  people  changed  the  health  of  that  bay.
I  was  afraid  of  womanhood  
Not  that  I'm, not  afraid  now, but  I've  learned  to  pretend  
I've  learned  to  be  flexible, 
Back  in  the  '50s  and  '60s, when  i  was  growing  up  little  girls  were  supposed  to  be  kind  and  thoughtful  and  pretty  and  gentle  and  soft. And  we  were  supposed  to  fit  into  roles  that  were  sort  of  shadowy  --  really  not  quite  clear.
Now, my  mother  was  different  
And  i  just  ate  it  up  
Because  women  are  on  the  ground  floor, and  we  know  the  traditions. So  well, we  can  bring  a  different  voice  to  the  table.
And  then  also  my  family  was  in  chaos, and  i  drew  to  try  to  bring  my  family  together  --  --  try  to  bring  my  family  together  with  laughter, 
But  i  feel  blessed  to  be  able  to  work  with  them  
Two  hundred  years  ago, the  united  states  was  less  than  a  few  percent.
It's  now, more  than  82  percent  
Now, listen  to  this  every  week  for  the  Foreseeable  future  until  2050  every  week, more  than  a  million  people  are  being  added  to  our  cities.
However, cities  despite  having  this  negative  aspect  to  them  are  also  the  solution, 
So  we  have  this  kind  of  Dual  nature.
That's  the  quest  
So  Here's  two  questions  that  i  have  in  my  head, when  i  think  about  this  problem, 
We  use  them  metaphorically  --  the  dna  of  a  company, the  metabolism  of  a  city  and  so  on  --  is  that  just  bullshit  metaphorical  bullshit, or  is  there  serious  substance  to  it  
And  if  that  is  the  case, how  come  that  It's  very  hard  to  kill  a  city  
You  could  drop  an  atom  bomb  on  a  city.
This  is  just  a  tiny  range  actually  It's  us  mammals  We're.
Rat  That's, a  rat  --  could  have  been  you  
We're  all  pretty  much  the  same  
And  you  see  You're  very  familiar  with  this  
Despite  the  fact  that  this  is  the  most  complex  and  diverse  system  in  the  universe, There's, an  extraordinary  simplicity  being  expressed  by  this  
So  a  wonderful  thing  about  all  of  biology  is  that  it  expresses  an  extraordinary  economy  of  scale, 
And  You're  very  familiar  with  these  networks.
And  Here's, the  summary  of  what  I'm  saying, 
Heart  rates  are  slower. You  live  longer  diffusion  of  oxygen  and  resources  across  membranes  is  slower, etc.
Here  it  is  which  says  that  the  bigger  you  are  the  more  you  have  per  capita. Unlike  biology  --  higher  wages, more  Super-creative  people  per  capita. As  you  get  bigger  more  patents  per  capita  more  crime  per  capita  .
See  companies  they  scale  
There  it  is, after  some  little  fluctuations  at  the  beginning.
But  you  notice  I've  cheated  because  I've  only  gone  up  to  '94  
And  i  put  in  front  of  them, an  authentic  experience  that  allowed  them  to  learn  for  themselves.
The  problem  then  becomes, how  do  you  take  Seventh-  and  Eighth-graders  to  a  talk  about  genocide  and  deal  with  the  subject  in  a  way  that  is  responsible  and  respectful, and  they  know  what  to  do  with  it.
I  moved  there, primarily  to  be  part  of  a  learning  environment  that  validated  the  way  that  i  knew  that  kids  learned, and  that  really  wanted  to  investigate  what  was  possible  when  you  are  willing  to  let  go  of  some  of  the  paradigms  of  the  past  of  information  scarcity  when  my  grandmother  was  in  school.
It  asked  them  to  create  for  themselves, and  it  allowed  them  to  fail  process.
Ask  them  to  go  to  places  to  see  things  for  themselves  to  actually  experience  the  learning  to  play  to  inquire  
This  is  one  of  my  favorite  photos, because  this  was  taken  on  tuesday  when  i  asked  the  students  to  go  to  the  polls  
There  are  words  that  We're  truly  afraid  of  
This  was  an  issue  from  2002  that  they  published  with  a  lot  of  different  articles  on  the  bionic  human  ,
Regenerative  medicine  is  what  business  week  put  up  when  they  did  a  story  about  regenerative  medicine, not  too  long  ago, 
And  you  can  basically  see  that  the  richer  a  country  is  the  older, the  people  are  within  it.
And  why  is  this  a  particularly  dramatic  challenge  right  now?
In  2010, two  workers  per  Retiree  in  the  us.
This  is  age  versus  cost  of  health  care.
This  video: i  think  gets  across  the  concept  that  I'm  talking  about  quite  dramatically  
The  way  to  do  that  is  to  develop  a  conversation  with  the  body  
In  a  child  before  the  age  of  about  six  months, if  they  lose  their  Fingertip  in  an  accident, They'll  re-grow  their  Fingertip  
We  heard  yesterday  about  the  importance  of  new  materials, 
I  Wouldn't  be  telling  you  this  story, if  it  Weren't  compelling  
This  is  a  horse.
After  treatment  That's  what  it  looks  like  
He  Chills  the  dish, it  changes  its  properties, and  he  Peels  it  right  out  of  the  dish.
It's  the  coolest  stuff  
In  this  case, at  the  end  of  the  bypass  operation, You're  going  to  see  the  stem  cells  from  the  patient  that  were  removed  at  the  beginning  of  the  procedure, being  injected  directly  into  the  heart  of  the  patient  
This  was  a  randomized  trial, 
There  go  the  cells  
Here's, another  example  of  stem-cell  therapy  that  Isn't  quite  clinical  yet.
So  you  could  go  in, you  could  get  your  Tummy-tuck  
Japan  is  the  oldest  country  on  earth  in  terms  of  its  average  age  
In  the  united  states, We've  had  a  somewhat  different  approach.
But  There's  been  no  strategic  investment  to  bring  all  of  the  necessary  things  to  bear  and  focus  them  in  a  careful  way.
And  these  tedsters  are  --  you  know, as  innocent  as  that  name  sounds  --  these  are  the  Philanthropists  and  artists  and  scientists  who  sort  of  shape  our  world  
And  what  could  i  possibly  have  to  say  that  would  be  distinguished  enough  to  justify  my  participation  in  something  like  that  
Well, my  characters  like  the  ones  in  my  shows  allow  me  to  play  with  the  spaces  between  those  questions.
What  i  should  tell  you  --  what  i  should  tell  you  is  that  They've  each  prepared  their  own  little  ted  talks, 
Well, you  know, she  calls  herself  black  --  She's, really  more  like  a  Caramel  color.
Frankly, I'm  Kvelling  just  to  be  here  with  all  the  Luminaries. You  have  attending  something  like  this.
So  many  others, you  see  They're  just  wonderful  
But  anyway, i  should  have  started  by  saying, just  how  lucky  i  feel  
You  know, i  Couldn't  have  dreamed  of  such  a  thing  as  a  young  girl: 
You  know, your  parents  must  be  very  proud  .
The  point  is  I'm  happy. Somebody  has  practical  ideas  to  get  us  out  of  this  mess.
So  happy, continued  success.
Sorry, this  is  such  a  wonderful  opportunity  and  everything  to  be  here  right  now  
My  name  is  Noraida  and  I'm  just  --  I'm  so  thrilled  to  be  part  of  like  your  ted  conference  that  You're  doing  and  everything  like  that.
Actually  you  could  say, i  grew  up  in  the  capital  of  dominican  republic, otherwise  known  as  washington  heights  in  new  york  city, 
And  i  think  He's  mexican. So  That's  --  honestly, That's  close  enough  for  me  right  now.
Okay, sorry.
Like  It's  --  i  Can't  get  over  this  right  now.
So  basically, like  da  bomb  --  what  Dominican-american  benevolent  organization  for  mothers  and  babies  does  is  basically  we  try  to  advocate  for  students  who  show  a  lot  of  academic  promise, and  who  also  happen  to  be  mothers  like  me, 
I  come  from  a  multicultural  family  
And  we  were  only  11  years  old, so  it  was  not  appropriate  .
Although  you  know, it  was  wonderful  
Well, i  just  wanted  to  quickly, say, good  evening, 
But  when  sarah  jones  asked  me  to  please  come  to  ted, i  said, well, you  know, first  i  Don't  know  that  you  know  --  before  two  years  ago, you  would  not  find  me  in  front  of  an  audience  of  people, much  less  like  this, because  i  did  not  like  to  give  speeches  because  i  feel  that  as  an  immigrant, i  do  not  have  good  english  skills  for  speaking  
But  That's  where  we  had  some  problems  
The  Daughter's  marriage  is  very  special  to  the  mom  
And  i  said, yes, men  can  be  difficult, but  all  women  have  to  get  used  to  that  
So  i  always  teach  my  kids  to  respect  american  ideas. But  i  told  my  daughter  that  this  is  one  exception  --  --  that  she  is  not  gay. She  is  just  confused  by  this  american  problem.
Thank  you  very  very  much.
Finished  university; education: got  a  medical  degree, 1986, 
But  critical  poverty, this  slide  is  from  a  presentation  i  gave  not  that  long  ago, Gapminderorg  tells  the  story  of  the  gap  between  africa  and  the  rest  of  the  world  in  terms  of  health  care.
Yes, I'm, sorry.
Because  It's  scary  and  It's  expensive, but  we  need  to  have  it. Ok?
That's  mike, mike  comes  out  from  mississippi  
See  That's, one  of  the  problems  we  have  in  nigeria  and  in  africa, generally  
It  looks  like  all  these  americans  are  here. And  yes, one  brit  and  He's, not  going  to  do  anything  --  he  thinks  He's  british  actually  and  He's  actually  nigerian.
We  eventually  got  it, working  is  the  truth, but  it  was  one  of  these  even  older  than  the  one  you  saw  
No, yes, Doesn't  matter.
And  currently  We're  working  on  oxygen  --  oxygen, delivery  on-site, 
So  That's, not  new, what  We're  doing  is  applying  this  technology  to  it  
These  are  members  of  my  graduating  class, 1986, ,
And  finally, i  get  a  call  last  year, and  then  i  have  to  go  up  after  Jj, Abrams  
Hollywood  gathers  around  power  tables  and  the  valley  gathers  around  power, tables, 
But  I'm  actually  here  today  to  tell  a  story  
And  what  he  said  was  he  Wasn't  so  much  afraid  that  he  might  die, but  that  he  Hadn't  done  the  things  that  he  wanted  to  with  his  life.
But  for  me, personally, it  was  a  real  change.
I  went  from  living  in  a  house  with  five  guys  in  palo  alto  and  living  off  their  Leftovers  to  all  of  a  sudden  having  all  kinds  of  resources  
Connecting  them  together  through  conferences  --  like  a  ted  --  brings  so  many  powerful  connections  or  through  the  world  forum  on  social  entrepreneurship  that  my  foundation  does  at  oxford  every  year  
So  in  2003, i  started  to  make  my  way  around  los  angeles  to  talk  about  the  idea  of  a  Pro-social  media  company.
One  of  the  lines  of  encouragement  that  i  heard  over  and  over  was  the  streets  of  hollywood  are  littered  with  the  Carcasses  of  people, like  you  who  think  You're  going  to  come  to  this  town  and  make  movies  
One  of  these  films  in  particular  called  north  country  was  actually  kind  of  a  box  office.
And  that  to  me  spoke  volumes  because  It's  --  the  film  started  about  a  True-life  story  about  a  woman  who  was  harassed  sued  her  employer  led  to  a  landmark  case  that  led  to  the  equal  opportunity  act  and  the  violence  against  women  act  and  others, 
At  that  point, i  thought  i  knew  something  about  global  warming.
And  we  have  10  films  in  production  right  now  and  dozens  others  in  development  
And  one  thing  that  I've  learned  is  that  There's  never  one  right  way  to  make  change  
And  i  can  imagine  if  we  do  this  the  headlines  in  10  years  might  read  something  like  these  new  aids  cases, in  africa  fall  to  zero  us  imports  its  last  barrel  of  oil  --  --  israelis  and  palestinians  celebrate  10  years  of  peaceful  Coexistence  
And  i  believe  that  working  together, we  can  make  all  of  these  things  happen.
The  next  day, all  the  artists  were  invited  to  join  mandela  in  robben  island, where  he  was  going  to  give  a  conference  to  the  World's  press, standing  in  front  of  his  former  prison  cell  
He  was  wearing  a  t-shirt  like  the  one  i  wear  now  
I've  subsequently  become  an  Envoy  for  scotland  and  hiv  
I  tell  her  story  to  everyone  because  she  represents  one  of  millions  of  hiv/aids.
I  think  That's  fair  to  say, It's, almost  everyone  in  the  hall.
But  now  we  have  this  new  layer  of  private  sovereignty  in  cyberspace  
And  their  decisions  about  software  coding  engineering  design  terms  of  service, all  act  as  a  kind  of  law  that  shapes  what  we  can  and  Cannot  do  with  our  digital  lives.
The  reality  is  that  even  in  democratic  societies  today  we  do  not  have  good  answers  for  how  you  balance. The  need  for  security  and  law  enforcement  on  one  hand  and  protection  of  civil  liberties  and  free  speech  on  the  other  in  our  digital  networks.
This  is  a  map  of  social  networks  worldwide, and  certainly  facebook  has  conquered  much  of  the  world  --  which  is  either  a  good  or  a  bad  thing, depending  on  how  you  like  the  way, facebook  manages  its  service  
In  plain  english  that  means  censorship  and  surveillance  of  their  users  
This  has  a  chilling  effect  on  People's  ability  to  use  the  internet  to  hold  government  accountable.
Thank  you  very  much  
Comparable  in  its  own  very  peculiar  way  to  the  achievements  of  microsoft  or  google  
Here  are  some  of  those  same  Weightlifters  after  their  1989  Makeover  
And  so  i  resolved  to  travel  around  the  world, examining  this  global  criminal  Underworld  by  talking  to  policemen  by  talking  to  victims  by  talking  to  consumers  of  illicit  goods  and  services  
Now  organized  crime  in  a  globalizing  world  operates  in  the  same  way  as  any  other  business  
And  it  is  this  western  desire  to  consume  that  is  the  primary  driver  of  international  organized  crime, 
And  as  a  consequence  of  this  trade, britain  alone  lost  eight  billion  dollars  in  revenue.
So  what  were  these  guys  doing  with  all  the  money?
Well, this  is  where  we  come  to  globalization, because  that  was  not  just  the  deregulation  of  global  trade.
This  one, however, is  in  central  british  columbia  where  i  photographed  it  
What  They've  done  is  They've  shifted  their  operations  
People  Don't  smoke  as  much  Dope  or  visit  prostitutes  quite  so  frequently  during  a  recession  
And  so, as  soon  as  i  saw  this  drop  into  my  Inbox, i  Dispatched  it  Hastily  to  the  recycle  bin  and  spared  myself, a  very  nasty  infection  
It's  such  a  large  conference, 
Mark  Serfaas  It's, pretty  cool, huh? Pursuing  happiness?
I  mean  --  no, i  mean, like  in  the  ted  sense, 
1860  --  am  i  good  
And  my  name  and  it  would  tell  me, and  i  have  to  tell  you  right  now. This  is  an  Unadulterated  piece  of  software. This  is  a  real  internet  browser. And  this  is  an  actual  google  site  and  We're  going  to  test  it  out  live  today.
Am  i  feeling  lucky  
Ze  frank, oh, amazing, 
Needless  to  say, i  was  able  to  leave  my  job  
Four  years  later, i  still  get  probably  two  or  three  hundred  emails  a  day  from  people. I   Don't  know  and  It's  been  an  amazing  opportunity  to  kind  of  get  to  know  different  cultures.
And  that  was  embarrassing  
So  the  Scribbler  is  an  attempt  to  create  a  generative  tool: 
I  mean, this  is  incredible.
None  of  the  Haikus  were  written  by  the  same  person. And  in  fact, no  line  was  --  you  know, each  line  is  contributed  by  a  different  person  at  a  different  --  at  a  different  time.
It  dances  to  music, Lotte, Reiniger, an  amazing  shadow  Puppeteer  in  the  '20s  that  started  doing  more  elaborate  things.
Chris  anderson: ladies  and  gentlemen, mr  ze  frank  
Well, this  is  2009  
So  I'm  going  to  talk  about  it  
We  get  the  geneticists  keeping  on  telling  us  how  extremely  closely  we  are  related  --  hardly  any  genes  of  difference  very, very  closely  related  
I'm, not  talking  about  Airy-fairy  stuff  about  culture  or  psychology  or  behavior  
Professor  Tobias  came  over  from  south  africa  and  spoke  to  university  college.
You've  believed  it  through  generations  
So  that  is  what  they  have  done  now  
Aaron  Filler  from  harvard  said, Isn't. It  time  we  stopped  talking  about  selective  pressures.
He  kept  it  to  himself  for  30  years.
And  at  that  time, it  became  set  in  stone. The  aquatic  theory  should  be  dumped  with  the  ufos.
I  suggested  it.
Peals  of  merry  laughter, 
That  crazy  woman, She's  off  again, She'll  say, anything  Won't.
This  has  come  'round  to  be  that  all  those  naked  Pachyderms  have  aquatic  ancestors  
So  this  is  a  close  connection  between  Nakedness  and  water  
Here, you  Can't  find  anybody  to  compare  it  with  because  We're, the  only  animal  that  walks  upright  on  two  legs.
There  is  only  one  circumstance  in  which  they  always  all  of  them  walk  on  two  legs. And  that  is  when  they  are  Wading  through  water.
David  attenborough  thinks  It's  significant  as  the  possible  beginning  of  our  Bipedalism  
In  the  whale  It's  complete  no  fat  inside  at  all  all  in  blubber, outside  ,
We  can  speak  
Try  to  imagine  a  gorilla  performing  the  same  maneuver, and  you  can  see  that  compared  with  gorilla. We  are  halfway  to  being  shaped  like  a  fish.
There  is  nothing  there  
I  Don't  believe  it  
There  was  professor  Tobias  He's  come  over  
Daniel  dennett  He's  come  over  
So  the  third  thing  that  might  happen  is  a  very  beautiful  thing.
I  can  tell  you  that  in  three  words, 
The  textbooks  Don't  mention  it  
And  It's, pretty  simple  
Everybody's  got  one  --  all  of  you  
And  so  when  working  as  an  interaction  designer, or  as  an  artist  who  deals  with  participation  --  creating  things  that  live  on  in  or  around  the  human  form  --  It's, really  a  powerful  space  to  work  within  
And  it  is  a  tool  that  actually  enables  one  to  listen  to  their  own  Innards  
When  i  meet  a  glacier  for  the  very  first  time, what  do  i  do?
Do  i  carve  a  message  in  the  snow  
But  really  the  most  satisfying  experience  I've  had  is  the  act  of  listening, which  is  what  we  need  in  any  good  relationship.
And  just  as  with  the  wall, how  i  wanted  to  be  more  Wall-like  with  this  project  I'd  actually  like  to  take  more  a  of  glacial  pace, 
So, how  do  you  do  that  
That  Doesn't  move  
Here's  my  promise  to  you  if  you  are  consistent  and  do  this.
Now  when  you  approach  these  animals, you  need  to  understand  There's, a  dangerous  end  to  them.
If  you  had  the  right  information, you  would  have  done  the  right  thing.
If  they  follow  protocol  They'll, pick  up  the  phone  and  say, hey, do  you  have  the  original  
And  you  actually  get  into  the  folder  that  the  elected  official  actually  has  to  read  
So  what  your  letter  means  I've  got  to  tell  you, we  are  all  in  a  party  and  political  officials  are  the  Pinatas  
Living  systems  are  in  constant  conversation  with  the  natural  world, through  sets  of  chemical  reactions  called  metabolism, 
And  this  is  the  conversion  of  one  group  of  substances  into  another  either  through  the  production, or  the  absorption  of  energy  
Now, That's  exactly  the  kind  of  process  that  I'm  interested  in  when  We're  thinking  about  sustainable  materials, 
It  is  able  to  move  around  its  environment.
It  can  follow  chemical  gradients, 
It  can  undergo  complex  reactions  some  of  which  are  happily  architectural  
Here, this  is  a  protocell  and  It's  vigorously  shedding.
The  protocells  can  actually  move  away  from  the  light  
So  this  is  really  interesting. Now  we  have  an  architecture  that  connects  a  city  to  the  natural  world  in  a  very  direct  and  immediate  way.
This  is  a  river  
The  reasons  vary  state  to  state, but  mostly  in  the  details, 
But  as  more  people  showed  up  wanting  water, the  folks  who  were  there  first  got  a  little  concerned.
There's  another  thing  happening  around  the  country, which  is  that  companies  are  starting  to  get  concerned  about  their  water  footprint  
So, what  can  they  do  about  this  remaining  water  footprint  that  can  have  serious  effects  on  the  ecosystem  
He  Doesn't  lose  the  water, right? He  just  chooses  to  apply  that  right  or  some  portion  of  it  to  the  stream.
This  Guy's, measuring  the  water  that  this  leaves  in  the  stream, 
He's  by  far  the  happiest  man  ever  measured  by  science  
Compassion  is  fun  
Therefore  to  create  the  conditions  for  global  compassion, all  we  have  to  do  is  to  reframe  compassion  as  something  that  is  fun.
These  are  leaders  who  are  highly  ambitious  for  the  greater  good  
And  they, according  to  the  research  make  the  best  business  leaders  
And  if  you  look  at  these  qualities, in  the  context  of  compassion, we  find  that  the  cognitive  and  affective  components  of  compassion  --  understanding  people  and  Empathizing  with  people  --  inhibits  tones  down  what  i  call  the  excessive  Self-obsession  That's  in  us, therefore  creating  the  conditions  for  humility, 
This  awareness  of  serving  the  greater  good  is  very  Self-inspiring, and  it  creates  fertile  ground  for  compassion  to  grow  in  
That's, one  
The  second  ingredient  is  autonomy.
And  this  also  creates  the  conditions  for  compassion  in  the  workplace.
I  found  this  to  be  true, both  on  the  individual  level  and  at  a  corporate  level, 
And  what  i  recognized  was  that  there  was  an  incredible  window  of  opportunity  for  us  as  a  world  community  to  come  together  and  end  torture  as  an  investigative  tool  
We  often  think  of  torture  as  being  political  torture  or  reserved  for  just  the  worst. But  in  fact, 95  percent  of  torture  today  is  not  for  political  prisoners.
So  It's  just  a  place  where  there  was  no  rule  of  law  
In  burundi, i  walked  into  a  prison  and  it  Wasn't  a  12-year-old  boy.
And  when  i  walked  up  to  the  prison  director, i  said, You've  got  to  let  her  out  
So  the  pieces  are  not  only  the  training  of  the  lawyers, but  us  finding  a  way  to  systematically  implement  early  access  to  counsel  because  they  are  the  Safeguard  in  the  system  for  people  who  are  being  tortured.
But  the  third, and  most  important  thing  is  that  we  make  a  commitment  to  this  
And  the  reason  that  i  think  that  those  words  are  interesting  is  because  those  were  the  same  kinds  of  words  that  were  used  for  people  who  decided  they  would  end  slavery  or  end.
So, you  know, There's  bars. And  by  the  time  that  vishna  was  getting  bigger, which  means  what  gets  bigger. Your  head  gets  bigger.
So  he  would  come  to  the  first  bar, the  second  bar, and  then  the  third  bar, and  then  really  slowly  move  his  head, so  he  could  fit  through  and  come  back  third  second  first. And  he  would  grab  my  Pinkie.
And  i  will  do  the  one  thing  that  i  can  do  
Thank  you  
We  were  in  queens. We  were  building  the  big  big, big, big  building  in  midtown.
But  It's, not  only  that  
In  italy  in  milan, especially  contemporary  art  really  Doesn't, have  that  much  of  a  place  
They  tried  to  make  a  Toddler's  gas  mask  in  such  a  way  that  the  toddler  can  be  held  by  the  parent.
Instead, she  said, no, no  work  and  leisure  can  be  together.
Yeah, That's, particularly  gorgeous  --  It's  the  tv  dinner  of  2001  
I  would  like, instead  to  talk  about  how  great  some  designers  are  
It's  a  long  story  because  it  started  before  2001, and  it  was  called  emergency  .
So  designers, sometimes  Don't  do  things  that  are  immediately, functional, but  They're, functional  to  our  understanding  of  issues.
This  is  cindy  van  den  Bremen, who  is  a  dutch  designer  That's  done  this  series  of  Capsters  
They  range  from  this  fluffy  toy  that  is  about  hugging  you  --  because  autistic  children  like  to  be  hugged  tight. So  it  has  a  spring  inside  --  all  the  way  to  this  doll  with  a  mirror. So  the  child  can  see  him  or  herself  in  the  mirror  and  regain  a  sense  of  self.
Design  really  looks  upon  the  whole  world, and  it  considers  the  world  in  all  of  its  different  ranges.
And  it  was  really  interesting  because  i  was  the  last  speaker. And  before  me, there  were  people  that  were  really  talking  about  luxury. And  i  Didn't  want  to  be  a  party  Pooper.
The  rhythm  of  the  Sinusoids  has  changed  tremendously  just  like  the  rhythm  of  our  life  in  the  past  25  years. So  I'm, not  sure  anymore.
But  design  and  science  and  the  possibility  of  visualizing  different  scales, and  therefore  really  work  at  the  scale  of  the  very  small  to  make  it  very  big  and  very  meaningful  
So  africa  is  a  complex  continent  full  of  contradictions, as  you  can  see  
And  i  want  to  tell  you  that  this  is  my  story.
And  It's, the  story  of  many  of  the  africans  who  are  here  
And  my  father  said, ok, listen, ,
So  we  went  to  the  school  and  because  we  were  Nobodies  and  because  we  Didn't  have  privilege  and  because  my  father  Didn't  have  the  right  last  name, he  was  treated  like  dirt.
But  the  money  ran  out  
You  Don't  see  the  blogger.
And  you  Didn't  know  about  the  windmill, you  know, 
And  i  was  just  moved  
So  what  is  to  be  done  
And  this  is  an  example, you  know, blogging  is  one  way  of  doing  that  
So  we  need  to  start  getting  better  
And  going  back  to  the  point  i  was  trying  to  make  this  is  the  swahili.
Swahili  is  spoken  by  about  50  million  people  in  east  africa.
So  That's  a  start  and  We've  heard  of  all  their  other  initiatives  
I  walked  away  from  a  job  with  one  of  the  top  firms  in  dc  Covington  and  Burling  six  figures  
What  are  they  doing  
Practically  i  mean, when  i  was  a  First-year  student  in  law  school, my  Mom's  business  had  collapsed.
My  sister  was  struggling  to  get  through  undergrad  
An  example, this  man  changed  my  life  
I  said, i  want  to  be  a  lawyer  
And  I'm  like  because  I'm  here  and  It's  cheap.
I  was  also  building  something  called  the  copenhagen  wheel, which  is  just  a  really  beautiful  beautiful  electric  bike  at  a  lab  at  mit  called  Senseable  city  lab  
This  is  a  place  where  my  friend  Abhishek  sen  was  Interning  
And  That's  his  actual  photograph, 
She  told  me  that  this  is  how  you  would  typically  test  for  anemia  
But  this  is  not  available  in  parol.
But  fundamentally, what  i  believe  is  that  the  map  behind  of  me  is  called  basically  the  map  of  anemia  
And  when  i  walked  in, she  was  already  at  the  table, 
And  she  said, i  saw  your  talk  Live-streamed  
So  of  course, the  only  thing  i  could  think  of  to  say  at  that  point  was  yeah  me.
Why  did  you  bring  this  up? Have  you  lost  your  mind?
And  i  said, I'm  just  thinking  about  it  a  little  bit  
And  my  life  did  end  when  that  happened  
The  first  is, vulnerability  is  not  weakness.
The  majority  of  people  
I  define  vulnerability  as  emotional  risk  exposure.
I  am  not  a  natural.
So  when  i  became  vulnerability, ted  like  an  action  figure  --  like  ninja  barbie, but  I'm  vulnerability. Ted  --  i  thought  I'm  going  to  leave  that  shame  stuff  behind. Because  i  spent  six  years  studying  shame  before  i  really  started  writing  and  talking  about  vulnerability.
But  in  surviving  this  last  year, i  was  reminded  of  a  cardinal  rule  --  not  a  research  rule, but  a  moral  imperative  from  my  upbringing  --  You've  got  to  dance  with  the  one  who  Brung, ya  
It  is  to  put  on  some  Galoshes  and  walk  through  and  find  our  way  around  
Here's, why  
I  Can't  wait  to  tell  people  this  
The  credit  goes  to  the  man  in  the  arena, whose  face  is  Marred  with  dust  and  blood  and  sweat  
That's, what  life  is  about  about  daring  greatly  about  being  in  the  arena  
I  know  your  dad, never  paid  attention, even  when  you  made  cfo, ,
Shame  drives  two  big  tapes  --  never  good  enough.
It's  uncomfortable, but  It's, adaptive  
I  did  not  interview  men  for  the  first  four  years  of  my  study  
And  he  said, That's, convenient  ,
So  i  started  interviewing  men  and  asking  questions, 
If  you  put  shame  in  a  petri  dish, it  needs  three  things  to  grow  exponentially  secrecy. Silence  and  judgment.
If  you  put  the  same  amount  of  shame  in  a  petri  dish  and  Douse  it  with  empathy, it  Can't  survive.
And  i  know  It's  seductive  to  stand  outside  the  arena, because  i  think  i  did  it  my  whole  life  and  think  to  myself  I'm  going  to  go  in  there  and  kick  some  ass  when  I'm  bulletproof  and  when  I'm  perfect  
We  want  you  to  go  in  
So  what  would  be  better  [than]  to  use  the  herring  gull  in  its  freedom, circling  and  Swooping  over  the  sea  and  [to]  use  this  as  a  role  model, 
So  maybe  We'll, try  it  once  --  to  fly  a  Smartbird  
We  have  to  turn  it  go  up  and  go  down  
Bruno  giussani: Markus: i  think  that  we  should  fly  it  once  more  
I  think  first  It's  important  for  us  to  recognize  what  it  is  to  be  blind.
Today, We're  reaching  not  even  10  percent  of  them  
He  had  to  mortgage  all  his  life  savings  to  make  a  bank  loan.
It  is  ourselves. We  are  healing.
This  helped  us  build  a  very  ethical  and  very  highly  Patient-centric  organization  and  systems  that  support  it  
So  what  is  in  this  video  is  a  surgeon  operating, and  then  you  see  on  the  other  side.
And  of  course, one  needs  the  mindset  to  be  wanting  to  give  away  what  you  have  as  a  surplus  
And  what  we  did  was  a  couple  of  very  Counter-intuitive  things.
And  then  over  time, we  were  able  to  bring  down  the  cost  significantly  to  about  two  percent  of  what  it  used  to  be  when  we  started  out  
So  We're  really  comparing  apples  to  apples  
So  i  want  to  end  my  talk  leaving  this  thought  and  challenge  to  you  
Dr: v: when  you  grow  in  spiritual  consciousness, we  identify  with  all  that  is  in  the  world. So  there  is  no  exploitation.
So  the  question  is, how  do  we  get  the  stuff  over  from  the  digital  into  the  physical  
Let  me  show  you  the  Weight-shifting  mobile  
Now  mass  is  the  first  thing.
Again, It's  a  mobile  phone-shaped  box. And  this  one  can  change  its  shape.
As  humans, we  are  social, we  are  empathic  and  That's, great  
So  That's, very  intuitive  and  That's  what  we  want  
The  brown  administration  and  a  bunch  of  my  friends, basically  Leveled  the  energy  efficiency  of  california. So  It's  the  same. Now, 30  years  later, even  though  our  economy  has  gone  up, 80  percent  per  capita  .
The  dominant  demographic  event  of  our  time  is  this  Screamingly, rapid, urbanization, that  we  have  going  on  
It's  interesting, because  history  is  driven  to  a  large  degree  by  the  size  of  cities  
People  are  following  opportunity  into  town.
It  is  not  the  case  that  slums  undermine  prosperity, not  the  working  slums. They  help  create  prosperity.
These  people  are  valuable  as  a  group  
You  look  at  that  lane  on  the  right  
They're  doing  it  through  an  outlaw  thing, the  informal  economy  
And  young  people  in  brand  new  cities, They're  inventing  doing  new  things  in  the  south  
Climate  is  a  profoundly  complex  Nonlinear  system, full  of  runaway  positive  feedbacks, hidden  thresholds  and  Irrevocable  tipping  points.
We're  going  to  keep  being  surprised  and  almost  all  the  surprises  are  going  to  be  bad  ones.
If  all  of  the  electricity  you  used  in  your  lifetime  was  nuclear  the  amount  of  waste  that  would  be  added  up  would  fit  in  a  coke  can  
It's  interesting  say  to  take  a  25-megawatt, 25  million  watts, and  you  compare  it  to  the  standard  big  iron  of  an  ordinary  Westinghouse  or  Ariva, which  is  12  16  billion  watts, 
These  things  are  way  smaller  They're, much  more  adaptable.
This  is  a  list  of  them.
And  as  those  events  keep  happening  We're  going  to  say, okay, what  can  we  do  about  that  really  
Here  is  an  example  that  Climatologists  like  a  lot  one  of  the  dozens  of  geoengineering  ideas, 
Now, this  Shouldn't  come  as  a  surprise  to  us  
As  with  bp, the  hole  does  get  plugged  at  least  temporarily. But  not  before  Exacting  a  tremendous  price.
Now, both  of  these  options  --  the  boy, genius  and  the  Scammer  --  are  going  to  make  you  vastly  Overconfident  and  therefore  more  prone  to  taking  even  bigger  risks  in  the  future.
The  gulf  of  mexico  is  a  very  big  ocean  
In  other  words, the  ocean  is  big.
A  new  bubble  will  replace  the  old  one  
Now, looking  at  these  images, It's  difficult  to  grasp  the  scale  of  this  operation, which  can  already  be  seen  from  space  and  could  grow  to  an  area  the  size  of  england  
An  escape  hatch  has  been  reached  
Ok: dh: oh, all  right!
I'm  now, pushing  my  luck, I'm  skipping  right  to  six  cups  
Also  three  with  his  left  
Oh  It's  time  for  Richard's, help  
Excuse  me, could  we  work  on  the  design  of  the  microphone?
Wow, You've  been  working  out  
Ok, here  we  go  
There  you  go  
First  one  
What  happened  there?
Do  you  want  me  to  hold  you  or  not? Dh: Don't.
Just  do  it  juggler  boys?
Even  the  pencil  
Will  someone  please  throw  a  small  farm  animal  up  onto  the  stage  
Where's, gloria  
Yeah, a  little  Sketchy  
What  do  you  want  me  to  do  with  it?
Nice  
Oh, barry, is  there  nothing?
You  are  my  hero  You're, my  jim  Shea, jr  
I  do  i  do  
Please, please  stay  seated, stay  seated.
Thank  you  very  much  
I  have  a  big  impact  on  the  planet  to  travel  here  by  plane, 
One  billion  people  have  not  enough  to  eat  
Palm  tree  plantation  in  borneo  
I  always  show  my  pictures  in  the  street.
Man, the  most  beautiful  thing  that  has  happened  to  me  in  life, 
Woman  love  love  is  nice.
Eighth  man: i  had  a  big  laugh  today.
Ninth  man: you  see  family  is  It's, awful  
My  family, what  can  i  say  
If  someday  i  can  achieve  something, i  would  like  to  say, thank  you  daddy  and  mommy, 
If  i  do  like  you, i  give  you  one  cow  and  many  other  things, and  we  become  friends  
Yab, you  can  also  go  to  the  website  answer  --  respond  to  the  questions.
Now, i  am  going  to  speak  to  you  about  my  movie.
Video, this  earth  is  four  and  a  half  billion  years  old  
There  is  no  business  on  this  movie  
Merci  Beaucoup, i  love  you  
Well, we  have  a  whole  or  team.
There  will  be  two  passes  here  in  the  same  patient  from  the  same  hole.
This  was  done  under  local  anesthesia  as  an  outpatient  
In  the  last  decade, There's  been  an  explosion  of  use  of  bone  marrow  stem  cells  to  treat  the  Patient's  other  diseases, such  as  heart  disease, vascular  disease, Orthopedics  tissue  engineering, even  in  neurology  to  treat  Parkinson's  and  diabetes  
We've  just  come  out  We're  Commercializing: this  year  generation, 20  of  the  marrow  miner, 
That  was  all  done  on  a  machine  that  looks  like  this  
So  now, what  we  do  is  we  take  a  genome, we  make  maybe  50  copies  of  it. We  cut  all  those  copies  up  into  little  50-base  reads.
And  he  sequenced, he  took  skin  cells, healthy  skin  and  Cancerous  bone  marrow, and  he  sequenced  the  whole  genomes  of  both  of  them  in  a  couple  of  weeks.
And  so  they  were  given  l-dopa  and  their  symptoms  did  improve, but  they  Weren't  totally  Asymptomatic.
And  so  what  he  did  was  he  got  his  kids  sequenced  
Thankfully, i  was  able  to  answer  a.
Not  hard  to  imagine, my  company  has  software  that  does  this  right  now  
It  can  be  summed  up  in  a  single  sentence.
And  things  can  happen  only  if  these  interactions  are  perfectly  balanced, 
All  of  these  matter  particles  come  in  Left-  and  right-handed  varieties  and  have  Anti-particle  partners  that  carry  opposite  charges.
These  matter  particles  all  interact  with  the  various  force  particles, 
The  most  important  thing  to  understand  here  is  that  There's  a  different  kind  of  charge  associated  with  each  of  these  forces.
A  particle  that  Hasn't  been  seen  yet, but  We're, pretty  sure  exists  is  the  higgs  particle, which  gives  masses  to  all  these  other  particles.
And  it  seems  strange  that  nature  would  have  so  many  elementary  particles  
The  most  familiar  charge  is  electric  charge.
Now, it  turns  out  the  electric  charge  is  actually  a  combination  of  two  other  charges, Hypercharge  and  weak  charge  
For  example, this  weak  force  particle  and  its  Anti-particle  can  be  created  in  a  collision.
One  of  the  weak  particles  could  decay  into  an  electron  and  an  Anti-neutrino.
So  There's  an  old  idea  in  particle  physics  that  this  known  pattern  of  charges, which  is  not  very  symmetric, could  emerge  from  a  more  perfect  pattern  that  gets  broken  --  similar  to  how  the  higgs  particle  breaks.
This  particular  choice  corresponds  to  a  grand  unified  theory  introduced  by  Pati  and  Salam  in  1973  
The  larger  pattern  allows  us  to  predict  the  existence  of  particles  that  have  never  been  seen  
These  particles  are  not  uniquely  identified  by  their  six  charges.
Each  point  in  this  pattern  corresponds  to  a  symmetry  of  this  very  complex  and  beautiful  shape  
And  this  idea  that  nature  is  described  by  mathematics  is  not  at  all  new  
In  1623  galileo  wrote  this  Nature's  grand  book, which  stands  continually  open  to  our  gaze  is  written  in  the  language  of  mathematics.
And  of  course, bad  for  me, personally, 
In  this  regard, new  physics  theories  are  a  lot  like  start-up  companies.
As  with  any  large  investment, it  can  be  emotionally  difficult  to  abandon  a  line  of  research  when  it  Isn't  working  out  
I  try  to  balance  my  life, equally  between  physics, love  and  surfing  --  my  own  three  charge  directions.
And  that  shape  has  remarkable  similarities  --  and  the  way  it  fits  into  this  E8  pattern  could  be  the  rest  of  the  picture.
They  are  more  like  us  than  any  other  living  creature  and  We've  heard  about  that  during  this  ted  conference  
Chimpanzees, i  believe  more  than  any  other  living  creature  have  helped  us  to  understand  that. After  all, there  is  no  sharp  line  between  humans  and  the  rest  of  the  animal  kingdom.
There  Isn't  time  to  go  into  it, but  It's, including  things  like  tree, nurseries  methods  of  farming  most  suitable  to  this  now  very  degraded, almost  Desert-like  land  up  in  these  mountains.
Ways  of  Reclaiming, Overused  farmland.
Perhaps  build  some  Schoolrooms  
And  We've  got, as  is  the  case  around  the  world  about  95  percent  of  all  loans  returned  
And  as  a  result  of  this  program  Something's  happening  for  conservation  
What's  happening  for  conservation  is  that  the  farmers  living  in  these  24  villages, instead  of  looking  on  us  as  a  bunch  of  white  people  coming  to  study  a  whole  bunch  of  monkeys  --  and  by  the  way, many  of  the  staff  are  now  tanzanian  --  but  when  we  began  the  tacare  program, it  was  a  tanzanian  team  going  into  the  villages  
And  everywhere  there  were  these  terrible  problems.
And  you  know, the  kind  I'm  talking  about  I'm  talking  about  pollution, 
The  water  --  water  is  perhaps  one  of  the  most  crucial  issues  that  We're  going  to  face  in  this  century  --  and  everywhere  water  is  being  polluted  by  agricultural  industrial  and  household  chemicals  that  still  are  being  sprayed  around  the  world, seemingly  with  the  inability  to  profit  from  past  experience.
In  many  parts  of  sub-saharan  africa, the  droughts  are  so  much  worse.
Well, do  you  think  there  could  be  some  kind  of  disconnect  between  this  extraordinarily  clever  brain, the  kind  of  brain  that  the  ted  technologies  Exemplify  and  the  human  heart, talking  about  it  in  the  Non-scientific  term  in  terms  of  love  and  compassion  is  there  some  disconnect  
We  have  compromised  their  future  
Hundreds  and  thousands  of  young  people  around  the  world  can  break  through  and  can  make  this  a  better  world  for  all  living  things.
One  of  their  projects  will  be  to  help  animals  --  not  just  wildlife  domestic  animals  as  well.
You  Can't  come  to  a  conference  like  ted  and  not  have  hope.
And  i  mean, think  of  the  technologies  
How  many  of  us  have  children  or  grandchildren, nieces  nephews, 
People  like  this  are  so  inspirational  
And  i  hope  that  some  of  us  can  get  together  and  talk  about  some  of  these  things, especially  the  roots  and  shoots  program.
And  it  was  very, very  exciting  for  me  to  meet  her  and  see, just  one  example  of  how  young  people  when  they  are  empowered, given  the  opportunity  to  take  action  to  make  the  world, a  better  place, truly  are  our  hope  for  tomorrow.
But  other  than  letting  some  of  you  live  out  your  fantasy  of  looking  as  cool  as  tom  cruise  in  minority  report.
You  can  get  video  Annotations  of  the  event  that  You're  reading  about  you  can  get  the  latest  sports  scores, etc.
I  then  in  the  last  few  years, learned  about  the  pacific  garbage  patch  and  the  gyre  
And  the  bigger  picture  is, we  need  to  find  a  way  to  turn  off  the  faucet  
It's, not  just  that  gyre  of  plastic  that  I'm  concerned  about  --  It's, the  gyre  of  plastic  in  the  supermarket  
You  put  something  in  a  bin, and  you  Don't  have  to  think  about  it.
And  I'm, sure, You'll  feel  that  It's  from  a  safe  source  
But  what  if  it  Wasn't  
The  smallest  bacteria  is  about  200  nanometers  
But  i  got  to  thinking, you  know, if  we  were  in  the  middle  of  a  flood  zone  in  bangladesh, the  water  Wouldn't  look  like  this  
There  we  go  mind  the  Electrics  
Pop  the  Cartridge  out, pop  a  new  one  in  
About  half  a  cent  a  day  to  run  
To  put  that  into  context, the  uk  government  spends  about  12  billion  pounds  a  year  on  foreign  aid.
Phyllis  Rodriguez, we  are  here  today, because  of  the  fact  that  we  have  what  most  people  consider  an  unusual  friendship, 
And  yet, it  feels  natural  to  us  now, 
And  when  i  saw  it  --  and  yet, through  the  shock, the  terrible  shock  and  the  terrible  explosion  in  our  lives, literally, we  were  not  vengeful  
I  am  the  mother  of  zacarias  Moussaoui  
My  son, i  Don't  know  where  he  is  
So  That's, why  i  decided  to  tell  my  story. So  that  my  suffering  is  something  positive  for  other  women.
We  must  be  Hand-in-hand  and  do  something  together.
So  if  i  can  save  one  of  the  young  girls  and  avoid  that  they  get  married  and  suffer  as  much  as  i  did. Well, this  is  something  good  .
I  would  like  to  say  that  i  have  learned  so  much  from  aicha  starting  with  that  day, we  had  our  very  first  meeting  with  other  family  members  --  which  was  a  very  private  meeting  with  security, because  it  was  november  2002.
Why  did  we  want  to  meet  her  
And  what  happened  then  is  we  all  told  our  stories  and  we  all  connected  as  human  beings.
I  never  had  met  someone  with  such  a  hard  life  from  such  a  totally  different  culture  and  environment  from  my  own  
And  these  are  always  periods, ladies  and  gentlemen, accompanied  by  turbulence  and  all  too  often  by  blood  
For  power  is  not  just  moving  Laterally  from  nation  to  nation  
It's  also  moving  vertically  ,
My  guess  is  for  what  It's  worth  is  that  the  united  states  will  remain  the  most  powerful  nation  on  earth  for  the  next  10  years  15. But  the  context  in  which  she  holds  her  power  has  now  radically  altered.
But  That's, not  a  usual  case  in  history  
A  fixed  polarity  of  power  means  fixed  alliances, 
Canning  the  great  british  foreign  secretary  once  said, britain  has  a  common  interest. But  no  common  allies.
At  that  time, the  defense  of  my  country  was  about  one  thing.
But  now  one  final  thing: 
Collective  security  is  not  enough  
Peace  has  come  to  northern  ireland, because  both  sides  realized  that  the  zero-sum  game  Couldn't  work  
And  so  suddenly, ladies  and  gentlemen, what  has  been  the  proposition  of  visionaries  and  poets  down  the  ages  becomes  something  we  have  to  take  seriously  as  a  matter  of  public  policy  
I  started  with  a  poem  I'll  end  with  one  
For  john  Donne, a  recommendation  of  morality  
But  if  you  ask  the  average  american  what  the  optimal  formula  of  longevity  is, they  probably  Couldn't  tell  you  
You  have  the  usda  food  pyramid, 
False  
It  reminds  me  of  my  college  days  
So  to  make  it  to  age  100, you  not  only  have  to  have  had  a  very  good  lifestyle.
That's  why  a  65-year-old  person  is  aging  at  a  rate  of  about  125  times  faster  than  a  12-year-old  person  
And  research  shows  that  they  would  be  years, largely  free  of  chronic  disease, heart  disease  cancer  and  diabetes, 
But  the  real  secret, i  think, lies  more  in  the  way  that  they  organize  their  society.
Just  look  at  the  advertisements, 
One  fifth, the  rate  of  colon  and  breast  cancer  big, killers  here  in  america, 
We're  down  to  one  and  half  right  now  
This  particular  moai, these  five, ladies  have  been  together  for  97  years.
And  then  one  day, boom, we  retire  
But  they  influence  each  other  in  profound  and  measurable  ways.
They  Don't  have  any  Conveniences  
That  burns  calories  just  as  much  as  going  on  the  treadmill  does  
They  know  how  to  set  up  their  life  in  the  right  way. So  they  have  the  right  outlook.
You  know, the  two  most  dangerous  years  in  your  life  are  the  year  You're  born  because  of  infant  mortality.
And  they  have  strategies  to  keep  from  overeating, little  things  that  nudge  them  away  from  the  table  at  the  right  time.
And  then  the  foundation  of  all, this  is  how  they  connect  
Diets, Don't  work, no  diet  in  the  history  of  the  world  has  ever  worked  for  more  than  two  percent  of  the  population  
So  when  i  had  the  chance  to  give  the  World's  expert  in  gravity, the  experience  of  zero  gravity, it  was  incredible  .
You  can  get  eight  10  minutes  of  weightlessness  --  how  Nasa's  trained  their  astronauts  for  so  long  
And  you  can  actually  roll  some  of  the  pictures  now, because  i  Don't  want  to  look  at  me  on  the  screen  
It's  almost  like  that  old  recipe  for  chicken  soup, where  you  boil  the  chicken  until  the  flavor  is  just  gone  
These  micro-machines, which  are  the  envy  of  Nanotechnologists  the  world  over  are  self-directed  powerful, precise  accurate  devices  that  are  made  out  of  strings  of  amino  acids.
And  so  what  I'm  going  to  show  you  is  a  Three-minute  Reader's, digest  version  of  the  first  aspect  of  this  film  that  we  produced  It's, an  ongoing  project, That's  going  to  go  another  four  or  five  years.
And  each  of  us  has  about  100000  of  these  things  running  around  right  now  inside  each  one  of  your  100  trillion  cells, 
So  no  matter  how  lazy  you  feel  You're, not  really  intrinsically  doing  nothing  
And  three  years  ago, one  of  the  things  i  learned  how  to  do  was  to  become  invisible  
I  Didn't, always  succeed.
A  friend  told  me, shortly  after  that, that  she  had  heard  that  tim  Russert, a  Nationally  renowned  journalist  had  been  talking  about  me  on  national  tv.
In  my  country  that  was  the  case  in  1974  
The  women  said, we  agree  We'll  use  pills, but  we  need  a  doctor  to  prescribe  the  pills.
Wherever  there  were  people  --  and  you  can  see  boats  with  the  women  selling  things  --  Here's, the  floating  market  selling  bananas  and  crabs  and  also  Contraceptives  --  wherever  you  find  people  You'll, find  Contraceptives  in  thailand, 
We  introduced  our  first  microcredit  program  in  1975  and  the  women  who  organized  it  said, we  only  want  to  lend  to  women  who  practice  family  planning.
It's  a  part  of  the  village  development  bank, It's, not  a  real  bank, but  It's  a  fund  --  microcredit  
And  then  we  thought  We'd  help  america  because  America's  been  helping  everyone  whether  they  want  help  or  not  
I  said, Don't  worry  come  over  and  I'll.
And  what  happened  
Then  aids  came  along  and  hit  thailand, and  we  had  to  stop  doing  a  lot  of  good  things  to  fight  aids, ,
But  unfortunately, the  government  was  in  denial: denial  denial: 
And  he  said, Mechai, could  you  come  and  join  
He  became  the  chairman  of  the  national  aids  committee  and  increased  the  budget  Fifty-fold  
And  then  we  gave  condoms  out  everywhere  on  the  streets  --  everywhere, everywhere, 
And  then  this  is  the  picture  i  mentioned  to  you  --  the  weapon  of  mass  protection  
We  all  need  to  help  
And  before  you  can  borrow  the  money, you  need  to  be  trained.
Otherwise  They'll, never  get  out  of  poverty.
And  It's  a  center, a  focal  point  for  economic  and  social  development.
So  we  have  now  found  the  weapon  of  mass  protection  
In  the  last  20  years, i  have  published  a  few  books, but  i  have  lived  in  anonymity  until  february  of  2006, when  i  carried  the  olympic  flag  in  the  winter  olympics  in  italy, 
That  made  me  a  celebrity.
My  measurements  
Those  athletes  had  Sacrificed  everything  to  compete  in  the  games.
When  asked  in  a  tv  interview, how  could  she  look  so  good  
Sophia  loren  was  right  in  front  of  me  --  She's, a  foot  taller  than  i  am  not  counting  the  Poofy  hair  
Somehow  she  manages  to  keep  her  seven  children  alive. And  a  few  months  later, she  gives  birth  to  premature  twins.
Somehow  the  family  survives  for  16  months, and  then  by  extraordinary  luck  and  the  passionate  heart  of  a  young  american  man, Sasha  Chanoff, who  manages  to  put  her  in  a  us  rescue  plane, rose  mapendo  and  her  nine  children  end  up  in  phoenix, arizona, where  They're  now  living  and  thriving  
Once  when  my  daughter  paula  was  in  her  twenties, she  said  to  me  that  feminism  was  dated  that  i  should  move  on  
Yes  for  privileged  women, like  my  daughter  and  all  of  us  here  today, but  not  for  most  of  our  sisters  in  the  rest  of  the  world  who  are  still  forced  into  premature  marriage, prostitution, forced  labor  --  they  have  children  that  they  Don't  want, or  they  Cannot  feed  
The  place  is  a  small  Women's  clinic  in  a  village  in  bangladesh  
She's  not  licensed  for  that  she  has  never  done  it.
The  Woman's  face  looks  like  a  Watermelon  
It  is  so  swollen  that  you  Can't  even  see  the  eyes  
Jenny  is  horrified  at  what  she  has  done. But  then  the  translator  explains  that  the  Patient's  condition  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  operation.
They  are  paid  less  than  men  for  the  same  work  if  They're  paid  at  all  and  they  remain  vulnerable  because  they  have  no  economic  independence, and  they  are  constantly  threatened  by  exploitation  violence  and  abuse  
In  any  war  today, most  of  the  casualties  are  civilians, mainly  women  and  children. They  are  collateral  damage.
I'm  talking  about  men  with  young  minds, of  course, 
Six  billion  hungry  carnivores  to  feed  by  2050  
And  when  you  think  that  80  percent  of  global  trade  in  food  now  is  controlled  by  just  five  multinational  corporations, It's, a  grim  picture  
So  the  grain  markets  were  to  the  south  of  the  city  
But  also  you  have  to  imagine  it  full  of  food  
And  if  we  look  at  an  image  of  Smithfield  in  1830, you  can  see  that  it  would  have  been  very  difficult  to  live  in  a  city  like  this  and  be  unaware  of  where  your  food  came  from  
It  even  got  built, but  nothing  to  do  with  this  vision  that  howard  had  
So  I've  come  up  with  an  alternative, which  is  sitopia  from  the  ancient  greek  Sitos  for  food  and  Topos  for  place.
I  believe  we  already  live  in  sitopia  
So  if  we  were  to  do  that, what  might  sitopia  look  like  
Because  without  these  kinds  of  people, we  Can't  have  places  like  this  
And  equally  important  is  the  negative  version  --  Don't  do  to  others  what  you  would  not  like  them  to  do  to  you  
I  sometimes  see  when  I'm  speaking  to  a  congregation  of  religious  people, a  sort  of  Mutinous  expression  crossing  their  faces  because  people  often  want  to  be  right.
And  so  we  have  a  choice, it  seems  to  me  
And  also  see  that  it  demands  acute  intelligence, not  just  a  Gooey, feeling  
In  this  room, all  this  expertise, if  we  joined  it  all  together, we  could  change  the  world.
Who  knew  about  extension  managers, 
Now, why  would  i  care  about  rome, particularly  
These  are  just  drawings  of  rome.
These  are  sketches  of  some  of  the  little  details  
Here's  a  little  map, and  i  thought  of  maps  at  the  beginning, maybe  i  should  just  try  and  do  a  little  atlas  of  my  favorite  streets  and  connections  in  rome  
Over  the  spanish  steps, we  go  
She  parks, her  dirigible  lowers  the  anchor  rope  and  climbs  down  for  a  closer  look  inside  
The  text  here  is  right  side  and  upside  down, so  that  you  are  forced  to  turn  the  book  around, and  you  can  see  it  from  ground  point  of  view. And  from  her  point  of  view  --  looking  in  the  hole, getting  a  different  kind  of  perspective, moving  you  around  the  space, particularly  appropriate  in  a  building  that  can  contain  perfectly  a  sphere  dimensions  of  the  diameter  being  the  same  as  the  distance  from  the  center  of  the  floor  to  the  center  of  the  oculus.
Everything  he  sees  from  this  point  on  is  slightly  affected  by  the  Linguine, but  keeps  on  moving  because  this  Guy's  got  a  job  to  do  
Then  i  thought, wait  a  minute.
If  i  do  a  foldout  page  on  the  left-hand  side  and  let  you  just  unfold  it, you  see  behind  it.
Pigeon's  progress  struck  me  as  a  Catchy  title.
You  can  see  the  Tombs  and  pines  and  so  on  and  so  forth, along  the  way, 
This  is  something  That's  a  little  bit, unusual  ,
This  is  one  of  those  things  i  show  to  my  students  because  It's  a  complete  Bastardization  --  a  denial  of  any  rules  of  perspective.
I  have  all  the  pieces  There's  santa  maria  della  pace, There's, a  soccer  ball, There's, a  little  bit  of  a  Bird's  wing  --  Nothing's  happening. So  i  had  to  rethink  it.
Thank  you  very  much  
So  There's  something  super  interesting  about  natural  systems, 
The  first  two  are  the  Macrobot  and  Decibot  
One  of  them  is  the  input  from  the  user  as  You're  building  your  bricks.
So  each  chain, or  each  element  wants  to  turn  right  or  left  
You're  telling  each  unit, if  it  should  turn  right  or  left  
So  you  can  basically  program  any  three-dimensional  shape  --  or  one-dimensional  two-dimensional  --  up  into  this  chain, completely  passively  
At  the  end  of  the  lecture, they  asked  a  number  of  questions.
And  he  reached  the  point  where  he  felt  that  there  must  be  something  out  there. That  was  smaller  than  the  smallest  forms  of  life  that  were  ever  known  --  bacteria  at  the  time.
As  we  started  to  look  at  this  information, we  would  see  that  about  20  percent  of  the  genetic  information  in  your  nose  Doesn't  match  anything  that  We've  ever  seen  before  --  no  plant  animal, fungus  virus  or  bacteria  
So  can  we  have  the  lights  off  please?
Well, not  quite  not  quite  perfect  --  you  see  in  intergalactic  space  --  intergalactic  space  is  completely  dark  pitch  dark  
That's, how  big  and  how  dark?
And  that  is  how  Un-typical  this  place  is  
Now  that  is  knowledge. And  if  that  Weren't  amazing  enough, the  Faithfulness  with  which  the  one  structure  resembles, the  other  is  increasing  with  time. That  is  the  growth  of  knowledge.
Now, how  does  the  solar  system  --  and  our  environment  in  the  form  of  us  --  acquire  this  special  relationship  with  the  rest  of  the  universe?
Well, one  thing  That's  true  about  stephen  Hawking's, remark  --  i  mean, it  is  true, but  It's  the  wrong  emphasis  one  thing  That's  true  about  it  is  that  it  Doesn't. Do  it  with  any  special  physics, There's, no  special  Dispensation, no  miracles  involved. It. Does  it  simply  with  three  things  that  we  have  here  in  abundance?
One  of  them  is  matter  because  the  growth  of  knowledge  is  a  form  of  information  processing. Information  processing  is  computation. Computation  requires  a  computer  --  There's, no  known  way  of  making  a  computer  without  matter.
And  the  same  --  well, if  we  could  do  that  We'd  automatically  have  an  energy  supply, because  the  Transmutation  would  be  a  fusion  reactor  --  and  evidence  
And  with  a  more  powerful  telescope  You'll, be  able  to  see  stars  and  planets  
And  locally  there, you  could  build  particle  accelerators  and  learn  elementary  particle  physics  and  chemistry  and  so  on.
The  danger  is, not  at  all  unprecedented  species, go  extinct.
And  It's  true  that  an  ounce  of  prevention  equals  a  pound  of  cure, but  That's, only  if  we  know  what  to  prevent  
The  world  is  buzzing  at  the  moment  with  plans  to  force  reductions  in  gas  emissions  at  all  costs.
They're  not  central  to  the  human  effort  to  face  this  problem  or  problems  in  general  
And  that  is, i  understand  that  Optimists  greatly  Outlive  Pessimists  
It's  only  10  years  ago, this  month, when  we  published  the  first  sequence  of  a  Free-living  organism  that  of  haemophilus  Influenzae  
We  can  now  do  that  same  genome  project  in  the  order  of  two  to  eight  hours  
And  we  started  the  Sorcerer  ii  expedition  where  we  were  as  with  great  oceanographic  expeditions, trying  to  sample  the  ocean, every  200  miles  
And  with  doing  this  We've  made  some  amazing  discoveries  
I  view  that  these  genes  are  now  not  only  the  design  components  of  evolution.
Transposons  are  just  small  pieces  of  dna  that  randomly  insert  in  the  genetic  code.
We  found  that  synthesizing  accurate  dna  in  large  pieces  was  extremely  difficult  
And  There's  only  two  countries  the  us  and  the  former  soviet  union  that  had  major  efforts  on  trying  to  create  biological  warfare, agents, 
I  think  future  engineered  species  could  be  the  source  of  food, hopefully  a  source  of  energy, environmental  Remediation, and  perhaps  replacing  the  petrochemical  industry.
It  was  actually  a  very  strange  study  because  the  various  religious  leaders  were  using  their  scriptures  as  law  books, and  they  Couldn't  find  anything  in  them  Prohibiting  making  life. So  it  must  be, ok. The  only  ultimate  concerns  were  biological  warfare  aspects  of  this, but  gave  us  the  go  ahead  to  start  these  experiments  for  the  reasons  we  were  doing  them.
It  poses  a  very  fascinating  puzzle  for  us  
In  particular  check  out  asia.
Zoom  in  on  haiti  in  outline  here, 
But  deng  xiaoping, instinctively  understood  the  importance  of  offering  choices  to  his  people  
Demonstrated  successes  there  led  to  a  consensus  for  a  move  toward  the  market  model  for  the  entire  economy.
We  can  go, do  it  over  and  over  again, 
We  also  need  the  choices  for  people.
The  final  thing  we  need  are  choices  for  leaders.
Now  when  i  say  that  some  of  you  are  starting  to  think  well, is  this  just  bringing  back  colonialism, 
Let  us  have  a  hong  kong  nearby  
Some  of  my  citizens  will  move  into  that  city  as  well  
Many  of  them  totally  get  the  notion  of  a  special  zone  that  people  can  opt  into  as  a  rule  
So  let  me  show  you  why  That's  wrong  
Take  this  representation  of  all  of  the  land, 
Their  kids  can  get  an  education.
So, what  will  it  take  to  get  started  building  the  first  charter  cities  scaling  this?
Let's  have  a  system  where  we  have  ownership  of  land  that  is  registered  in  a  government  office  that  people  can  pledge  as  collateral

Philip  Zimbardo  Let's  tune  into  the  conversation  of  the  Principals  in  Adam's  temptation.
Come  on, adam  Don't, be  so  Wishy-washy, take  a  bite.
I  Don't  want  to  get  in  trouble.
Life  is  temptation. It's  all  about  yielding  resisting. Yes, no.
What  determines  any  decision  you  make  
You  can  focus  on  Past-positive  or  Past-negative  
And  moderate  on  Present-hedonism  
They  sacrifice  family  time, they  sacrifice  friend  time, 
I'm  sure  that  resonates  with  some  of  the  tedsters  
Told  me, Don't  eat  that  marshmallow.
And  of  all  the  places  in  the  solar  system  that  we  might  go  to  and  search  for  answers  to  questions  like  this, There's  saturn, and  we  have  been  to  saturn  before  --  we  visited  saturn  in  the  early  1980s  --  but  our  investigations  of  saturn  have  become  far  more  In-depth  in  detail  since  the  cassini  spacecraft  traveling  across  Interplanetary  space  for  seven  years, Glided  into  orbit  around  saturn  in  the  summer  of  2004  and  became  at  that  point, the  farthest  robotic  Outpost  that  humanity  had  ever  established  around  the  sun.
In  fact, just  studying  the  rings  alone, we  stand  to  learn  a  lot  about  the  discs  of  stars  and  gas  that  we  call  the  spiral  galaxies.
And  these  molecules  high  up  in  the  atmosphere  of  titan, get  broken  down  and  their  products  join  together  to  make  haze  particles, 
Try  to  imagine  what  the  surface  of  titan  might  look  like  
It's  cold, It's, eerie, It's  Misty. It  might  be  raining.
As  i  said, it  has  a  thick  extensive  atmosphere  
We  have  instruments  on  cassini, which  can  see  down  to  the  surface  through  this  atmosphere. And  my  camera  system  is  one  of  them.
They  look  like  They've  been  pulled  apart, 
So  it  was  --  i  mean, I'm  getting  goose  bumps  just  talking  about  it.
But  this  is  somewhat  of  a  shoreline.
And  obviously  it  landed  in  one  of  these  flat, dark  regions  and  it  Didn't  sink  out  of  sight.
And  It's, probably  the  case  that  this  material  has  washed  off  the  highlands  of  titan  through  these  channels  that  we  saw  and  has  Drained  over  billions  of  years  to  fill  in  low-lying  basins.
And  i  think  you  would  agree  that  we  have  found  titan  is  a  remarkable  mystical  place  It's, exotic  It's  alien. But  yet, strangely  earth-like  and  having  earth-like  geological  formations  and  a  tremendous  geographical  diversity, and  is  a  fascinating  world  whose  only  rival  in  the  solar  system  for  complexity  and  richness  is  the  earth  itself.
It  is  a  very  Geologically  active  body  
Or  this  
Really  
We're, having  trouble  feeding  six  billion  today, 
When  we  look  at  a  map  of  los  angeles  or  london, it  is  hard  to  believe  that  as  of  2005, only  15  percent  of  the  world  was  mapped  to  a  Geo-codable  level  of  detail  
At  google  40, volunteers  used  a  new  software  to  map, 120000  kilometers  of  roads, 3000, hospitals, logistics  and  relief  points.
Nobel  prize  nominee  Hernando  de  Soto  recognized  that  the  key  to  economic  Liftoff  for  most  developing  countries  is  to  tap  the  vast  amounts  of  Uncapitalized  land.
Welcome  to  the  new  world, 
When  i  travel  with  my  work  across  europe  and  the  united  states, one  question, always  comes  up, where  is  the  palestinian  gandhi?
Israeli  soldier: a  nonviolent  protest  is  not  going  to  stop  the  [unclear]  
Julia  Bacha, when  i  first  heard  about  the  story  of  budrus, i  was  surprised  that  the  international  media  had  failed  to  cover  the  extraordinary  set  of  events  that  happened  seven  years  ago  in  2003  
They  had  been  using  nonviolence  for  about  two  years, but  had  grown  Disenchanted  since  nobody  was  paying  attention.
A  week  later, they  held  the  most  Well-attended  and  disciplined  demonstration  to  date  
So  the  human  brain  has  about  a  hundred  billion  neurons  in  it.
So  beyond  spatial  memory, if  we  look  for  this  Grid-like  firing  pattern  throughout  the  whole  brain, we  see  it  in  a  whole  series  of  locations  which  are  always  active  when  we  do  all  kinds  of  autobiographical  memory  tasks  like  remembering  the  last  time, you  went  to  a  wedding, for  example, 
Or  better, how  do  you  explain  when  others  are  able  to  achieve  things  that  seem  to  defy  all  of  the  assumptions?
Why  how  what  
We  say, what  we  do, we  say, how  We're  different  or  how  We're  better. And  we  expect  some  sort  of  a  behavior, a  purchase  a  vote.
All  i  did  was  reverse  the  order  of  the  information  
In  other  words, when  we  communicate  from  the  outside  in, yes, people  can  understand  vast  amounts  of  complicated  information  like  features  and  benefits  and  facts  and  figures  
When  we  can  communicate  from  the  inside  out  We're  talking  directly  to  the  part  of  the  brain  that  controls  behavior, and  then  we  allow  people  to  rationalize  it  with  the  tangible  things.
And  samuel  pierpont  langley  had  what  we  assume  to  be  the  recipe  for  success, 
The  next  34  percent  are  your  early  majority, your  late  majority  and  your  Laggards  
The  problem  is, how  do  you  find  the  ones  that  get  it  before  You're  doing  business  with  them  versus  the  ones  who  Don't  get  it?
People  Don't  buy  what  you  do, they  buy  why  you  do  it.
They  were  extremely  Well-funded  
In  the  summer  of  1963, 250000  people  showed  up  on  the  mall  in  washington  to  hear  dr.
