it has a child running through a field ,COMMA or something like that .PERIOD

and you might think this is a small thing ,COMMA but i think it 's important because it sets a tone and it reinforces the dangerous idea that politics is a spectator sport .PERIOD 
so what you 're seeing here is the one letter abbreviation for amino acids ,COMMA and i 've colored in the glycines with green ,COMMA and the alanines in red ,COMMA and so you can see it 's just a lot of g 's and a 's .PERIOD 
it 's not slavishly mimicking -- although al is trying to get the hairdo going -- it 's not a slavish mimicry ;SEMICOLON it 's taking the design principles ,COMMA the genius of the natural world ,COMMA and learning something from it .PERIOD

i 'm going to have the last laugh ,COMMA though .PERIOD 
conflict parties also need to be prepared to return to the negotiation table if the agreement implementation stalls .PERIOD

you 're putting yourself ,COMMA you 're binding yourself ,COMMA and you 're weaseling your way out of it ,COMMA and then you 're beating yourself up afterwards .PERIOD 
i think that vote is occurring right now .PERIOD 
and if you look closely at these ballot forms ,COMMA you 'll notice that the candidate list is in a different order on each one .PERIOD 
but one reason is because it indicates a change ,COMMA from before to after .PERIOD 
and she said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i think it 's too late .PERIOD 
one is fully passive ,COMMA like i just described -- as in ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA the trucker example ,COMMA where we do n't actually intervene in the population in any way .PERIOD

it 's mozart as i ,COMMA riccardo muti ,COMMA understand it .PERIOD 
this is how it works ,COMMA and really ,COMMA this is a generic technology .PERIOD 
and so i am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision .PERIOD 
and put another way ,COMMA the crux of the problem is the machine that we use for thinking about other minds ,COMMA our brain ,COMMA is made up of pieces ,COMMA brain cells ,COMMA that we share with all other animals ,COMMA with monkeys and mice and even sea slugs .PERIOD 
it is a huge benefit .PERIOD 
and since we always refer to the project as the mountain ,COMMA we commissioned this japanese himalaya photographer to give us this beautiful photo of mount everest ,COMMA making the entire building a <NUM> square meter artwork .PERIOD 
he was laid to rest in the ganges river ,COMMA where the dead are cremated along the banks of the river or tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water .PERIOD

of course ,COMMA in this day and age ,COMMA the trick is not to let each tree be obscured by that bush in washington that can get -- can get in the way .PERIOD 
listen ,COMMA you 'll see being dead is dandy .PERIOD

wow ,COMMA they don ’ t do that in graduate schools ,COMMA i don ’ t think .PERIOD 
if that do n't flow off the tongue ,COMMA what does ?QUESTIONMARK 
it actually takes a little longer .PERIOD it takes five days .PERIOD 
and one of the reasons they do that is that they turn users into producers ,COMMA consumers into designers .PERIOD 
the second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the approach that we started with is to ask :COLON is it really practical to make things of this sort ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades .PERIOD 
so those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into .PERIOD 
let me start with the observation that most of the sound around us is accidental ,COMMA and much of it is unpleasant .PERIOD 
and there 's a very important distinction there that we 'll get to .PERIOD

now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it with a simple ,COMMA honest approach of a gradually rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed <NUM> percent electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis ,COMMA with the government not keeping one dime .PERIOD 
and then i took a bite ,COMMA and i wished that it was tinier ,COMMA because kobe beef is so rich .PERIOD 
we are there to inspire ,COMMA to provoke ,COMMA to mobilize ,COMMA to bring hope to our people .PERIOD

most people make a strict correlation between how much time ,COMMA and if you like ,COMMA love -- not romantic love ,COMMA though that may be something -- but love in general ,COMMA respect ,COMMA they are willing to accord us ,COMMA that will be strictly defined by our position in the social hierarchy .PERIOD

so ,COMMA if we could have the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible ,COMMA i have a flask that has bioluminescent plankton in it .PERIOD 
you 're actually looking inside my head as i speak .PERIOD 
and then when he paused ,COMMA and everyone looked at me for a response ,COMMA from a balcony perspective ,COMMA i was able to thank him for his remarks and say ,COMMA i appreciate your criticism of my country ,COMMA and i take it as a sign that we 're among friends and can speak candidly to one another .PERIOD 
and so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms and allowed the theater and our client to actually do this with confidence that they would be able to change over their configurations at will .PERIOD 
raise your hand if you had a serious fall in your household ,COMMA or any of your loved ones ,COMMA your parents or so forth .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK 
all of us are engaged in a seismic ,COMMA fundamental realignment of culture and communications ,COMMA a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry ,COMMA the magazine industry ,COMMA the book and publishing industry and more .PERIOD 
it 's getting pretty close to finished now .PERIOD 
and i always thought it was such a fantastic device .PERIOD 
and i feel very privileged to have stumbled across it living in the maldives .PERIOD 
and if you do n't understand that in your mental model of this stuff ,COMMA what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous ,COMMA and i think that 's exactly the wrong image for when you 're trying to teach science .PERIOD 
these people do n't need the million dollars perhaps ,COMMA but would n't you think they 'd like to take it just to make me look silly ?QUESTIONMARK 
so the idea was ,COMMA okay ,COMMA keep that feeling of freedom ,COMMA but change the vector and increase the time .PERIOD 
there we go ,COMMA the automobile .PERIOD 
two years ago at ted ,COMMA i think -- i 've come to this conclusion -- i think i may have been suffering from a strange delusion .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA with the mit media lab ,COMMA for quite a while now ,COMMA we 've been engaged in a field called active music .PERIOD 
and the big question ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is why ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA here 's an image from the hubble space telescope .PERIOD 
they put all their heads together and they decided that there was nothing that could be done for this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world ,COMMA who by that time had become so overwhelmed ,COMMA not just with depression and feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy ,COMMA but with obsessional thinking ,COMMA obsessional thinking about coincidences .PERIOD 
right now ,COMMA we do n't have that but i 'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage .PERIOD 
it is constantly there .PERIOD and ,COMMA just as an example ,COMMA this is one that recently came to me .PERIOD 
collaborator six :COLON watching the video in my room ,COMMA i could see me not understanding at the beginning of it .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is a project for nine inch nails .PERIOD 
well secretary albright ,COMMA i guess you 'll be going to heaven .PERIOD 
because i wanted to let them know every day of their life that they have value at this place i call my center .PERIOD 
why is that ?QUESTIONMARK 
man :COLON yes ,COMMA well ,COMMA first ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i 'm part of news corporation as part of fox entertainment group .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA if you have a ham butt problem ,COMMA and you 're thinking about the ham butt problem ,COMMA the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive :COLON paper is the enemy of words .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA <NUM> years later ,COMMA i 'm proud to tell you ,COMMA last year we fed two million people in <NUM> countries through our foundation ,COMMA all during the holidays :COLON thanksgiving ,COMMA christmas -- -- in all the different countries around the world .PERIOD 
so this notion of loss aversion kicks in when it comes to savings too ,COMMA because people ,COMMA mentally and emotionally and intuitively frame savings as a loss because i have to cut my spending .PERIOD 
if you look at this piece of paper ,COMMA this is the breadth and this is called length .PERIOD 
woman :COLON were n't they square ?QUESTIONMARK 
okay ,COMMA so the great majority of us .PERIOD 
it is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough resources to live dignified lives ,COMMA where these people have enough access to education and health care ,COMMA so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear .PERIOD 
and it happened over four continents .PERIOD 
it 's motion and emotion .PERIOD 
why is intel willing to fund that ?QUESTIONMARK 
i 've tried to encourage young girls .PERIOD 
some of the studies even say we 're happier .PERIOD 
but she did find heme ,COMMA which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin .PERIOD 
so when those two are together ,COMMA the molecule is neutral and nothing gets stuck down .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA subsequently i participated in every single <NUM> event that i could take part in and gave news conferences ,COMMA interviews ,COMMA talking and using my platform as a musician ,COMMA with my commitment to mandela -- out of respect for the tremendous ,COMMA unbelievable work that he had done .PERIOD 
and they grow to be about this size .PERIOD 
you can talk about creationism -- which i think would n't go down well with this audience ,COMMA at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it -- or you can talk about optimisations ,COMMA spelled the british way ,COMMA with an s ,COMMA instead of a z .PERIOD 
and the women said ,COMMA it really is .PERIOD 
and once the conditions are present ,COMMA what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake .PERIOD 
what ?QUESTIONMARK 
that 's all great ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
okay ,COMMA he 's got his experimental notebook out .PERIOD 
so what i was trying to do is think of a way that we could study suspended animation to think about a way to reproduce ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA what happened to the skier .PERIOD 
average happiness is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA inadequate ,COMMA because it does n't speak to the moment-by-moment experience ,COMMA and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in moment-to-moment experience .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things .PERIOD 
they 're not around anymore .PERIOD well actually ,COMMA they are .PERIOD 
all you can do ,COMMA like a farmer ,COMMA is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish .PERIOD 
you start to believe that it 's alive and aware .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA when i showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone taking pictures of them like his children in the grass .PERIOD 
the good news is that ,COMMA in addition to having more predators ,COMMA there 's more of everything .PERIOD 
now the doha tribeca film festival is not an imported festival ,COMMA but rather an important festival between the cities of new york and doha .PERIOD 
i would like to see oracle take up that ,COMMA or some other technological geniuses work on this .PERIOD 
use science to ,COMMA you know ,COMMA work backwards and say ,COMMA well ,COMMA really ,COMMA what were they thinking ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is a strange ,COMMA rather perverse ,COMMA story ,COMMA just to put it in very simple terms .PERIOD 
these are n't the last words i 'll share .PERIOD 
and the other one was called adorable .PERIOD 
she 's <NUM> years old .PERIOD this is what fema gave her .PERIOD 
and you can see ,COMMA this is a little fantail bird .PERIOD 
some anthropologists call that the original affluent society .PERIOD 
and i 'm going to tell you that story here in a moment .PERIOD 
the stories we were hearing got us to the south pole .PERIOD 
i was only four years old when i saw my mother load a washing machine for the very first time in her life .PERIOD 
how does that compare with the way computers work ?QUESTIONMARK 
but there are more important things that are already occurring :COLON embryo screening .PERIOD 
the importance is that that technique has been democratized .PERIOD 
come back ,COMMA look for the peanut ,COMMA go away .PERIOD 
they say ,COMMA let 's question authority .PERIOD 
mark jacobson :COLON thank you .PERIOD 
and as soon as the crabs touched the arm ,COMMA it was lights out .PERIOD 
developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned :COLON the developers ,COMMA government and the community where these projects go up .PERIOD 
anyone can kill me ,COMMA or you ,COMMA or you .PERIOD 
we urgently need to change this .PERIOD 
i could hear it ,COMMA but i dared not to move .PERIOD i did n't move .PERIOD 
and we 're starting to be much more careful about how we save and how we invest .PERIOD 
obama had to issue a press release .PERIOD 
working with space and the lines in space in a different way .PERIOD 
i started this with <NUM> dollars ,COMMA and start fundraising money to where i 've been going .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if you think i 'm exaggerating at all in this ,COMMA all you have to do is substitute something else ,COMMA like indonesian .PERIOD 
today i combine all my passions as the ceo of interaxon ,COMMA a thought-controlled computing company .PERIOD 
<NUM> years ago you could not have found a single sober economist anywhere on planet earth who would have predicted the wikipedia model .PERIOD 
because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera ,COMMA they took pictures of everything .PERIOD more than <NUM> .PERIOD 
you just look at the consequences and see if ,COMMA overall ,COMMA it 's for the good or for the worse .PERIOD 
here 's what he said .PERIOD 
it 's a fact that is ,COMMA itself ,COMMA unseen ,COMMA yet impossible to vary .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
and we met with him .PERIOD 
audience :COLON itay talgam :COLON good .PERIOD now like a karajan .PERIOD since you 're already trained ,COMMA let me concentrate ,COMMA close my eyes .PERIOD come ,COMMA come .PERIOD 
and they were unexpected and they were surprising .PERIOD 
kbi :COLON i 'm just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it wo n't affect my face -- the explosion ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
and so that 's the basic thing doctors are trained to do ,COMMA and it 's miraculous in the case of infectious disease -- how well it works .PERIOD 
i want to know the people behind my dinner choices .PERIOD 
i became a parent .PERIOD 
and by the time the movie comes out in may ,COMMA this will be updated to <NUM> and we will have click-through purchases of offsets .PERIOD 
it was not really you .PERIOD 
all those side effects ,COMMA you know ,COMMA oily residue and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA whatever they say in those commercials :COLON forget about that .PERIOD 
if you look at where they 're located -- and on this slide it 's the red blobs on there -- there are five that are operating in the mid-east ,COMMA and the rest of them are in the united states .PERIOD 
nigerian newspapers circulations spiked .PERIOD 
i also discovered that an ir mouse responds to crt emissions and starts to move by itself ,COMMA so this is a self-drawing machine .PERIOD 
which is lower than most olympic athletes .PERIOD 
this group uses three ,COMMA one each .PERIOD 
and so we started thinking .PERIOD 
so we need to recognize those hot spots and do our best to protect them .PERIOD 
there are these wizards everywhere .PERIOD 
rarely seen by the naked eye ,COMMA this intersection between the animal world and the plant world is truly a magic moment .PERIOD 
because i thought ,COMMA i still maintain ,COMMA that serious and independent media companies are great business .PERIOD 
and then he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i must give them a car that they can afford ,COMMA one lakh car ,COMMA $ <NUM> car .PERIOD 
there was a very influential book about that ,COMMA which was mainly about getting governments out of the market .PERIOD 
your ears are always on -- you have no ear lids .PERIOD 
one of the most interesting revelations came not from an answer to a question ,COMMA but from a simple gesture of hospitality .PERIOD 
so this takes care of my age .PERIOD 
my wife 's ill .PERIOD i 've got no money .PERIOD what can i do ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i could be wrong ,COMMA i do n't know ,COMMA but i wish you would come tomorrow .PERIOD 
after <NUM> seconds ,COMMA even an expert could n't tell the difference ,COMMA and after three minutes -- well ,COMMA if you really studied it ,COMMA you 'd see a difference .PERIOD 
i feel so strongly that you can not ask a small farmer to work the land and bend over to grow a hectare of rice ,COMMA <NUM> times ,COMMA just to plant a crop and weed it .PERIOD 
and you know what these are .PERIOD 
we really have to teach children that chicken is not a giraffe .PERIOD 
what the squid has developed is a shutter that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria .PERIOD 
it looks good ,COMMA yeah ?QUESTIONMARK 
the third generation prototype is ,COMMA right now ,COMMA in uganda being tested .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the man was very impressed with this young man of <NUM> who could immediately give him the formula ,COMMA so he recruited him .PERIOD 
six months later the newspaper was closed .PERIOD 
he 's taught them to spell his name ,COMMA which is aldo .PERIOD 
sometimes i think the fates must grin as we denounce them and insist the only reason we ca n't win ,COMMA is the fates themselves that miss .PERIOD 
we have policies that reward sprawl -- we have all kinds of policies .PERIOD 
we 're not doing that at any scale on governance .PERIOD 
there has been this centralized event in a place called lake chenghai ,COMMA china .PERIOD 
that 's the beauty of randomization .PERIOD 
james burke :COLON you 'll be pleased to know ,COMMA i 'm sure ,COMMA that there are several ways to create a hypercard interactive video .PERIOD 
so many of you know that that 's beethoven 's seventh symphony .PERIOD 
think of it in the following terms .PERIOD think of it as beginning to program stuff for specific purposes .PERIOD 
because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold .PERIOD 
and even though the workday is typically eight hours ,COMMA how many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office ?QUESTIONMARK 
there 's a starry crown in heaven ,COMMA i know .PERIOD 
and since that time ,COMMA all of the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior .PERIOD 
and the species in the soil go to work basically chewing through those roots ,COMMA decomposing them -- the earthworms ,COMMA the fungi ,COMMA the bacteria -- and the result is new soil .PERIOD 
no .PERIOD not now either .PERIOD 
here 's a bit more .PERIOD 
very similar to what we just did ,COMMA but a little bit more complex .PERIOD 
but this trend is less unambiguous .PERIOD 
that was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it ,COMMA though luckily ,COMMA they lost interest before killing it .PERIOD 
so architecture maybe is not so big ,COMMA like science ,COMMA but through its focal point it can leverage in an archimedian way what we think the world is really about .PERIOD 
it explains why hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners ,COMMA and why companies like unilever and p & amp ;SEMICOLON g keep brands separate ,COMMA like ariel and pringles and dove rather than having one giant parent brand .PERIOD 
there are some creatures on this planet already that do n't really do aging .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA in saudi arabia there is a phenomenon called the religious police .PERIOD 
just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality .PERIOD 
they 're all having some difficulty walking .PERIOD 
and one of our real worries with colony collapse disorder is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead-out colonies .PERIOD 
we 're still trying to explain and come to terms with what is the evolutionary advantage of this .PERIOD 
with my eyes shut .PERIOD ha-ha .PERIOD 
in each chapter ,COMMA you can see the external forces of governance ,COMMA power and territory or religion colliding with the internal forces of psychological and physical inheritance .PERIOD 
so i did some research .PERIOD 
so here is the thinking different bit .PERIOD 
what i want to talk to you about is what we can learn from studying the genomes of living people and extinct humans .PERIOD 
i think it 's worth the trouble because ,COMMA again ,COMMA it just helps us to understand .PERIOD 
and you will see ,COMMA the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we 've decided ethanol is going to help us .PERIOD 
compassion on earth is given ,COMMA it is in us .PERIOD 
and the second ,COMMA is that we actually do n't have a clue of what all these products that surround us are made of .PERIOD 
a play ballet .PERIOD 
incredibly ,COMMA all of this can be communicated on just a few square inches of a screen .PERIOD 
i see .PERIOD maybe come back here .PERIOD 
you build platforms for self-expression and collaboration .PERIOD 
if you find out -- now i understand .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA if you 're squeamish ,COMMA you do n't want to watch .PERIOD 
harvest contaminated tobacco .PERIOD 
as a matter of fact ,COMMA feynman ,COMMA as a child ,COMMA was very fascinated by this .PERIOD 
and this graffiti artist has come along ,COMMA made this sign a little bit better ,COMMA and then moved on .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA that spoils the game for the other hunters who hunt in the daytime ,COMMA so in canada that 's illegal .PERIOD in new zealand ,COMMA it 's legal ,COMMA because the new zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits ,COMMA because the rabbits compete with the sheep in new zealand .PERIOD 
what 's the story .PERIOD 
<NUM> years ago ,COMMA the roman poet juvenal said something that today echoes in the heart of every true mexican .PERIOD 
and i saw this beautiful place .PERIOD i knew i wanted to come back .PERIOD 
i think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing .PERIOD 
and here we are now .PERIOD 
and you show up ,COMMA and it 's dead .PERIOD 
if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel there are unsure whether this person 's hostile or not .PERIOD 
but then two or three days afterward ,COMMA babies begin to pay attention to their mother 's or their father 's face .PERIOD 
we 're pretty sure that the only people who do n't experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA we no longer see ,COMMA within this process ,COMMA the traditional master architect creating a sketch that his minions carry out .PERIOD 
and they gave subjects the same wine ,COMMA labeled with different price tags .PERIOD 
but this time what we did is we put a slippery patch that you see in yellow there .PERIOD 
so we were essentially mapping the microcircuitry of the brain :COLON which cells are communicating with which cells ,COMMA with which chemicals ,COMMA and then in what quantities of those chemicals ?QUESTIONMARK 
and this is the dilemma ,COMMA this is the paradox ,COMMA of beauty .PERIOD 
that 's all the u.s. usage today .PERIOD 
the colors are codes for the direction ,COMMA from whether it is back to front or vice versa .PERIOD 
this is what i have found :COLON to let ourselves be seen ,COMMA deeply seen ,COMMA vulnerably seen ;SEMICOLON to love with our whole hearts ,COMMA even though there 's no guarantee -- and that 's really hard ,COMMA and i can tell you as a parent ,COMMA that 's excruciatingly difficult -- to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror ,COMMA when we 're wondering ,COMMA can i love you this much ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is one of the participatory -- one of the participatory models we see coming out of that ,COMMA along with ushahidi .PERIOD 
they 'll be having two bottles .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
we were asked by a device producer -- we did the palm pilot and the treo .PERIOD 
the problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves .PERIOD 
we just allowed them to pick this up on their own .PERIOD 
this is the quarter-scale prototype that was functioning in spain .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA you 're responding with all of these .PERIOD 
we have our very own pond inside our bodies .PERIOD 
he went around and told people what he believed .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy .PERIOD 
there 's actually a little read out down there of our planetary atmosphere ,COMMA pressure and temperature .PERIOD 
there 's the old one ,COMMA responsible for windows and office .PERIOD 
and second ,COMMA it gives us the opportunity to understand how these supermassive black holes interact with their environment ,COMMA and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in .PERIOD 
this is underneath jeff 's desk .PERIOD 
and so we can accurately -- if the magnet is big enough ,COMMA and your resolution is high enough -- you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body and start to get an understanding of the individual system .PERIOD 
i was mesmerized .PERIOD 
this is looking at ascending versus descending flights .PERIOD 
they 're like a mild cold .PERIOD 
so before we can really start to make life ,COMMA we have to really think about where it came from .PERIOD 
when you see a diagram like this ,COMMA i do n't want you to be afraid .PERIOD 
but my mother has lived by this creed all her life .PERIOD 
it 's an important lesson for kids to understand -- that some of these laws get broken by accident and that laws have to be interpreted .PERIOD 
we have <NUM> official languages that are recognized in our constitution .PERIOD 
it 's progress ,COMMA that 's the thing .PERIOD 
are we suddenly going to see a lot more female characters in cartoons and in games and on tv shows ?QUESTIONMARK 
i think we could roll the tape ,COMMA admin .PERIOD 
edith widder :COLON so i recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye .PERIOD 
it 's really a wholly separate radiation .PERIOD 
so the one on the right was done first ,COMMA and then the one on the left was done over it .PERIOD 
it requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self-defining act .PERIOD 
and sometimes we settle for the world as it is ,COMMA even when it does n't reflect our values and aspirations .PERIOD 
so the problem is that measuring -- if you try to measure all the proteins ,COMMA it 's a very elaborate process .PERIOD 
others work through the instrument of money .PERIOD 
these are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the test of any idea -- i said it was a literary conceit -- is what does it get us ?QUESTIONMARK 
with whole grain bread ,COMMA you have other obstacles .PERIOD 
so there was the topiary there .PERIOD 
and that 's going to pose an enormous problem .PERIOD 
i began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in nashville .PERIOD 
the queen just lays the eggs .PERIOD there 's no management .PERIOD 
the science done by the young einstein will continue as long as our civilization ,COMMA but for civilization to survive ,COMMA we 'll need the wisdom of the old einstein -- humane ,COMMA global and farseeing .PERIOD 
if you want to change the world ,COMMA you have to group together ,COMMA you have to be collaborative .PERIOD 
she 's here .PERIOD she 's also a doctor .PERIOD 
whether they 're individuals or organizations ,COMMA we follow those who lead ,COMMA not because we have to ,COMMA but because we want to .PERIOD 
ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA can any one of you tell me a neighbor ,COMMA a friend ,COMMA a relative that you know ,COMMA who became rich by receiving charity ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so that 's incredible .PERIOD and there 's no money to do that .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i mean it makes me crazy .PERIOD 
and if you turn the lights on ,COMMA you might periodically see spectacular organisms swim by ,COMMA because those are the denizens of the deep ,COMMA the things that live in the deep ocean .PERIOD 
you would say -- yeah ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA we all know this ;SEMICOLON water covers twice the area of the planet than dry land .PERIOD 
another example is in portsmouth ,COMMA u.k .PERIOD 
hello ?QUESTIONMARK 
take a look at what that is !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
in switzerland -- germany ,COMMA actually -- on the rhine across from basel ,COMMA we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum .PERIOD 
so we can now ,COMMA in a matter of hours ,COMMA determine a whole human genome .PERIOD 
this is another favorite of mine .PERIOD 
you can see the tumor treating field field generator ,COMMA but importantly you can also see that she is living her life .PERIOD 
as a matter of fact he did know willie brown ,COMMA and willie brown and herbie and i had dinner four years ago ,COMMA and we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth .PERIOD 
this is intimacy to women .PERIOD 
but it is a politics of principle ,COMMA not of partisanship .PERIOD 
and the bit that remains ,COMMA the one with your marks -- this is your encrypted vote .PERIOD 
she said that the last time she had done it was on the disneyland tram .PERIOD 
and when you feed these kids bad food ,COMMA that 's what they 're learning .PERIOD so that 's really what this is all about .PERIOD 
one :COLON production is too low .PERIOD two :COLON price is too high .PERIOD 
that is a huge change in the media landscape we 're used to .PERIOD 
yet ,COMMA when we take a step back ,COMMA and look over the span of history ,COMMA at what we might call the petroleum interval ,COMMA it 's a short period in history where we 've discovered this extraordinary material ,COMMA and then based a whole way of life around it .PERIOD 
before it 's all done we are going to alter ourselves every bit as much as we have changed the world around us .PERIOD 
it 's physically possible to lose weight .PERIOD 
and the mater has some scales and puts it all together .PERIOD 
well he did n't write anything about it in the origin of species .PERIOD 
the one percent will own even more than <NUM> percent of all the world 's goods and services .PERIOD not because they 've grown richer ,COMMA but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer .PERIOD 
encouraging telecommuting ?QUESTIONMARK what works ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful ;SEMICOLON they did n't lie ,COMMA cheat ,COMMA steal or abandon their comrades .PERIOD 
and i think that as we look at culture ,COMMA we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are .PERIOD 
there is n't enough water .PERIOD 
where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm 's length from politics ?QUESTIONMARK 
they do n't even have to get rich yet .PERIOD just the opportunity of coming up in the world means they will have fewer ,COMMA higher-quality kids ,COMMA and the birthrate goes down radically .PERIOD 
that bothers me the most .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA not all asteroids are that big .PERIOD 
now what i learned from her ,COMMA is a woman ,COMMA not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then ,COMMA and what was being done to her son ,COMMA but the life she 's had .PERIOD 
and these synapses together form the network or the circuit of the brain .PERIOD 
it looks like there are rivers on it ,COMMA there are oceans or lakes ,COMMA we know there are clouds .PERIOD we think it 's raining also on it .PERIOD 
you bend down ,COMMA you pat him -- you reward him for jumping up .PERIOD 
and there 's really no evidence that says -- well ,COMMA other than people just have disbelief that cells can do what they do .PERIOD 
at this moment in time ,COMMA the youth in the arab world are much more wiser and capable of creating the change than the old -- including the political and cultural and ideological old regimes .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA one of the problems with planting trees is that the people in these regions are so poor that they chop them down for firewood .PERIOD 
time goes on .PERIOD 
and there are non-zero-sum relationships that maybe people are n't aware of .PERIOD 
and then i thought about how ,COMMA much as travel insurance does n't cover acts of god ,COMMA probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy .PERIOD 
i would fear science in general if properly understood .PERIOD 
we got <NUM> of the world 's best economists ,COMMA three in each area .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA when we have these calls for proposals ,COMMA i try to find a match between my potential ideas and the problem .PERIOD if there is a match we write a research proposal ,COMMA get the research funding in ,COMMA and that 's how we start our research programs .PERIOD 
if a card shark gathers the cards together ,COMMA immediately when he -- before he deals the card .PERIOD now ,COMMA so i think ,COMMA number three ,COMMA i have arranged them in a full house .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA that 's buy three ,COMMA get one free .PERIOD that kind of thing .PERIOD 
i want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can .PERIOD 
interestingly ,COMMA it 's done a crossover before ,COMMA but not the crossovers that matter .PERIOD 
they call themselves the elder brothers .PERIOD 
fall down nine times ,COMMA get up <NUM> .PERIOD 
he was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter ,COMMA and i was frankie p. toronto .PERIOD 
we 'd really better give you a longer sound bite .PERIOD

be it corn shellers -- you 've got ploughs ;SEMICOLON you 've got fan mills ;SEMICOLON all these things -- and these are not ,COMMA again ,COMMA antiques .PERIOD these are -- you can order these .PERIOD you can go to the web and you can buy them now ,COMMA brand-new made .PERIOD so in a certain sense ,COMMA technologies do n't die .PERIOD 
this may ,COMMA we 're going to go from minus <NUM> meters in zacaton ,COMMA and if we 're very lucky ,COMMA depthx will bring back the first robotically-discovered division of bacteria .PERIOD 
this is a typical insulin injection .PERIOD 
good evening everybody .PERIOD 
and richard meier ,COMMA who was one of my teachers ,COMMA kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism ,COMMA and he would say ,COMMA bill ,COMMA you 've got to understand- -- solar energy has nothing to do with architecture .PERIOD 
because what they 're doing is they 're saying ,COMMA your coat 's not so glamorous ,COMMA what 's been edited out is something important .PERIOD 
i want to tell you the story of just one of these streams because it 's an archetype for the larger story .PERIOD 
they put it in a little tiny glass jar ,COMMA with a wonderful enameled label on it ,COMMA made it look french ,COMMA even though it 's made in oxnard ,COMMA california .PERIOD 
when you go into beauty the probability wave collapses into one possibility .PERIOD

it does n't have an environment that adapts to it ;SEMICOLON it has to adapt to the environment .PERIOD 
these are all tacos eaten in mexico city near a train station on july fifth to july sixth .PERIOD

none of those things happened ,COMMA and astonishingly ,COMMA if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime ,COMMA the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet ,COMMA in real terms ,COMMA adjusted for inflation ,COMMA has tripled .PERIOD 
it takes what we know ,COMMA and it twists it .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
you 've probably heard the term interdependence applied to the modern world .PERIOD well ,COMMA that 's just another term for non-zero-sum .PERIOD 
there 's a youtube video that you can download and look at this ,COMMA if you want to convey the information to other people about virtual autopsies .PERIOD 
we do not create revolutions .PERIOD 
when i wrote my report to the koreans ,COMMA i said ,COMMA look ,COMMA i do n't know what this guy was doing ,COMMA but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend .PERIOD

and so began to have multiple pens on the page -- again ,COMMA hard to do with our hands .PERIOD 
in the world of blogs ,COMMA there 's going to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami ,COMMA because one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that ,COMMA although initially -- that is ,COMMA in that first day -- there was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting ,COMMA there was a dearth of live video and some people complained about this .PERIOD 
and every time ,COMMA i kept going back home listening to the problems of these people -- sick people ,COMMA people with no water ,COMMA all this stuff -- and every time i go back to america ,COMMA i kept thinking about them .PERIOD

now ,COMMA personally ,COMMA i think i 'm not the first one who has done this analysis ,COMMA but i 'll leave this to your good judgment .PERIOD 
giveindia is for a whole country .PERIOD

the argument has always been made ,COMMA and it will always be made ,COMMA that we know enough about the universe .PERIOD

all of our patents ,COMMA our entire approach to patents and invention ,COMMA is based on the idea that the inventor knows what the invention is for ;SEMICOLON we can say what it 's for .PERIOD

not exclusive to these things ,COMMA but in addition to them ,COMMA is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground .PERIOD

chris anderson :COLON thank you .PERIOD 
and when you have that ,COMMA then evolutionary theory tells us that natural selection will favor the more exploitative ,COMMA more predator-like organisms .PERIOD 
we even ruled out the idea of using makeup .PERIOD 
but the irony is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA that angela can do this because she 's the one person who you know would never ,COMMA ever ,COMMA ever break any rules of wikipedia .PERIOD 
and the studio executives ,COMMA they would say ,COMMA hey ,COMMA look at shekhar .PERIOD he 's so prepared .PERIOD 
and at that time two years ago i mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers ,COMMA and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface ,COMMA but we were n't really sure .PERIOD 
he 's beginning to focus ,COMMA he can concentrate now .PERIOD

two months later ,COMMA something incredible happens .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA there is french chinese food ,COMMA where they serve salt and pepper frog legs .PERIOD

because ,COMMA remember ,COMMA the web got to stand on top of all this heavy infrastructure that had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA they are hungry always .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it was done on this group of patients .PERIOD 
but he was told he could n't go on the hike this year because one of the students in the class was disabled ,COMMA so the other <NUM> students did n't get to go on the hike either .PERIOD

and yeah ,COMMA you really can .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA as we have faced liability ,COMMA we have stepped back and back ,COMMA and unfortunately ,COMMA where there is liability ,COMMA guess what there is :COLON power .PERIOD 
this is important ,COMMA because many times students ,COMMA they fear or they feel uncomfortable how others might think about their opinions and thoughts .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA these guys actually work for nasa ,COMMA and they 're trying to pioneer using off-the-shelf components ,COMMA cheap things that are n't specialized that they can combine and send up into space .PERIOD

that 's good .PERIOD 
which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder .PERIOD

it 's not making headlines ,COMMA it 's not making news ,COMMA it 's not flashy .PERIOD 
the lifesaver bottle works really simply .PERIOD

mri generates over a thousand .PERIOD

so ,COMMA my closing thought .PERIOD 
right from the age of <NUM> ,COMMA when i started looking around me ,COMMA i started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children who are left in sexual slavery-like practices ,COMMA but have absolutely no respite ,COMMA because we do n't allow them to come in .PERIOD

its behavior is completely unchanged .PERIOD 
now here -- and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon -- there is good news ,COMMA amazing news ,COMMA in the <NUM> century ,COMMA and that is that ,COMMA almost out of nowhere ,COMMA there has come into being an anti-genocide movement ,COMMA an anti-genocide constituency ,COMMA and one that looks destined ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA to be permanent .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA i could just show you this little piece of paper .PERIOD 
this is not a dead body .PERIOD this is a body who basically ,COMMA in this particular case ,COMMA feels the force and tries to protect its head .PERIOD 
but if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology ,COMMA called the alphabet ,COMMA and writing ,COMMA we 're totally dependent on it ,COMMA and it 's transformed culture .PERIOD 
do you know where it 's going ?QUESTIONMARK 
know the facts ,COMMA but see how they fit in the big picture .PERIOD

we could look across time at the same people -- people ,COMMA for example ,COMMA who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia -- and ask what the contribution of mothering ,COMMA of genetics are ,COMMA and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses .PERIOD

keep to the track ,COMMA to the beaten track ;SEMICOLON no-one is waiting and nothing is there .PERIOD 
they 're not going to be aware of what 's happening and you can kill them better .PERIOD

and does purpose play into it ?QUESTIONMARK 
aside from ,COMMA you know ,COMMA getting people excited and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place ,COMMA it asked the school system to envision how it might become a catalyst for a more connected community .PERIOD

so that 's the breathing loop in a nutshell .PERIOD 
this is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .PERIOD

this new economy is pretty indifferent to size and strength ,COMMA which is what 's helped men along all these years .PERIOD

but it 's hard sometimes to talk about these things ,COMMA so bear with me .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you would just walk around london at this point and just be overwhelmed with this stench .PERIOD 
thing is ,COMMA in science ,COMMA you basically have to tell the funding agencies what you 're going to discover before they 'll give you the money .PERIOD 
one of the shattering events in the history of mathematics ,COMMA which is not appreciated by many people ,COMMA occurred about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA <NUM> years ago .PERIOD

the good ngos ,COMMA like oxfam ,COMMA are very keen on this idea .PERIOD 
it 's the second world war .PERIOD 
we have this non-zero-sum relationship ,COMMA and i think that does lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that you realize that someone else 's welfare is positively correlated with yours -- you 're more likely to cut them a break .PERIOD 
maybe that 's where the whole inspiration thing started from ,COMMA puppets ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
and that 's really the simplest computer .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD right to left ,COMMA how many ?QUESTIONMARK okay .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA if you 're building a bridge ,COMMA details are pretty important because it will fall down if you ignore the details .PERIOD

you know ,COMMA they were marginalized in the negotiation room .PERIOD 
it 's very ,COMMA very interesting that men ,COMMA more than women ,COMMA tend to be more competitive here .PERIOD 
um yeah .PERIOD so we do n't actually know what the lethality was of the <NUM> strain to wild birds before it jumped from birds to humans .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA in a way it was the most serious thing you could possible do at the expo .PERIOD

and then odysseus says ,COMMA i see that you can get it .PERIOD 
many women were taken as slaves by rebels and soldiers ,COMMA as sexual slaves who were forced also to carry the ammunition and the water and the food for the soldiers .PERIOD

there are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do ,COMMA and those are errors in estimating the odds that they 're going to succeed ,COMMA and errors in estimating the value of their own success .PERIOD

compare this to the die-hard devotion of many americans ,COMMA not just to a particular flavor of soda ,COMMA but to a particular brand .PERIOD 
the answer to that question changes depending on who 's sitting around that table .PERIOD 
and it 's within these tribes that all of our work gets done .PERIOD 
it does n't mean you have to get through school .PERIOD 
and the kids soon learn that all projects go awry -- and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success ,COMMA or gleeful calamity .PERIOD 
and so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light .PERIOD 
that 's terrific .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
this is kanzi .PERIOD

i would like to help others rediscover that wonder -- to want to engage with it ,COMMA to want to learn ,COMMA to want to share what they 've learned ,COMMA what they 've figured out to be true and what they 're still figuring out .PERIOD 
but then i stopped ,COMMA because i figured i was this hot-shot guy and i should n't have to work at ideas ,COMMA they should just come like magic .PERIOD 
so i 'm really sorry .PERIOD but when you use a part of something -- like the dictionary is a part of the language ,COMMA or a flag stands for the united states ,COMMA it 's a symbol of the country -- then you 're using it synecdochically .PERIOD 
the media has covered this somewhat extensively .PERIOD

they talk about corruption .PERIOD

it seems to us that when people start dissembling ,COMMA people start lying about things ,COMMA that 's when it gets really interesting .PERIOD 
in games and virtual worlds ,COMMA for example ,COMMA your facial expressions can naturally and intuitively be used to control an avatar or virtual character .PERIOD

you 're a little bit excited with the first head -- you get rather more excited with the next tail .PERIOD

my obsession with this book ,COMMA and the reason i made this into a film ,COMMA is because it at once was addressing the question of being a female -- traditionally ,COMMA historically in iran -- and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change ,COMMA freedom and democracy -- while the country of iran ,COMMA equally ,COMMA as if another character ,COMMA also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions .PERIOD 
we need to focus on reducing the oil .PERIOD

instead of building a building as big as the football pitch ,COMMA we focused it on this one element .PERIOD

the place that you see here on the left side was interconnected .PERIOD it was based on this diversity .PERIOD

the height of these mountains on either side of this valley is greater than the alps in most cases .PERIOD 
this is one of my sons ,COMMA rayan ,COMMA who 's a scooby doo addict .PERIOD

you might think of that as the privatization of war .PERIOD

and he dug in his heels and said ,COMMA no .PERIOD i know this man better than any of you .PERIOD i have met with him over and over again .PERIOD

and there 's probably even some new ones since i 've been here last .PERIOD 
the final thing is the notion of india as a single market -- because when you did n't think of india as a market ,COMMA you did n't really bother about a single market ,COMMA because it did n't really matter .PERIOD

now ,COMMA to do that -- with your tax dollars ,COMMA thank you -- i bought all these machines .PERIOD we made a modest proposal to the nsf .PERIOD we wanted to be able to make anything on any length scale ,COMMA all in one place ,COMMA because you ca n't segregate digital fabrication by a discipline or a length scale .PERIOD

i 'm the happiest guy you 're ever going to meet .PERIOD 
i believe ,COMMA number one ,COMMA it 's complacency .PERIOD 
it 's a great story ,COMMA and it 's understandable why they would be reluctant to revise it .PERIOD 
and you just draw a stick figure ,COMMA and it calculates the crease pattern .PERIOD 
this is where i realized that there was really a need to communicate ,COMMA because the data of what 's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware .PERIOD 
they had good relationships with the teachers ,COMMA students .PERIOD 
we 're going to sing those three wonderful notes :COLON t ,COMMA e ,COMMA d .PERIOD

and on the left are the cutting machines ,COMMA which then ,COMMA in the factory ,COMMA enable those individual pieces to be fabricated and plus or minus very ,COMMA very few millimeters ,COMMA to be slotted together on site .PERIOD 
but perhaps the most popular has been that we 've got another array of these boys in the bronx river ,COMMA where the first beaver -- crazy as he is -- to have moved in and built a lodge in new york in <NUM> years ,COMMA hangs out .PERIOD 
so these young men and women learned job-readiness and life skills through bee keeping and became productive citizens in the process .PERIOD

by the way ,COMMA i do make it look a little bit easier than it is .PERIOD 
this is the opening frame of the video that we created .PERIOD 
i 'm not sure this is an improvement ,COMMA or a good idea ,COMMA because ,COMMA like ,COMMA if you do n't spend quite enough time in front of your computer ,COMMA you can now get a plate in the keyboard ,COMMA so there 's no more faking it -- that you do n't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway .PERIOD 
it could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and lights up a patch of the land ,COMMA highlighting it compared to the dim environment .PERIOD

he said that his vote was in his heart .PERIOD

yes ,COMMA contributions actually do make a difference and they set a context for having a conversation ,COMMA but it takes some time to build up .PERIOD 
starting with newspapers ,COMMA what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement for making information ,COMMA knowledge and culture ,COMMA which led to a stark bifurcation between producers -- who had to be able to raise financial capital ,COMMA just like any other industrial organization -- and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could produce .PERIOD 
in a thick arabic accent ,COMMA my brain went ,COMMA berfect .PERIOD

so you 're building on something that is not pure self-interest .PERIOD 
and the expedition started in february last year .PERIOD 
power is chaotically distributed .PERIOD 
we are certainly amazing ,COMMA and we regularly solve complex problems with amazing creativity .PERIOD 
because when it asked its staff ,COMMA all its staff ,COMMA to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not ,COMMA a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening .PERIOD 
and there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky .PERIOD

i think there 's something really interesting to watching people as they go through this creative toil -- something we can all relate to ,COMMA this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing .PERIOD

we 're going to turn to another technology ,COMMA called algorithmic self-assembly of tiles .PERIOD 
all other theories explaining the big brain ,COMMA and language ,COMMA and tool use and all these things that make us unique ,COMMA are based upon genes .PERIOD 
and if we can quiet it down and walk in and say ,COMMA i 'm going to do this ,COMMA we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the time is who ?QUESTIONMARK 
so my story really is as much about that convergence in the americas as it 's a convergence story in eurasia .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA because i 'm looking for the upside here ,COMMA i 've got to have believable upside .PERIOD 
seeing people die every day ,COMMA my mother crying ,COMMA it 's like i was raised in a violence .PERIOD 
is n't that a wonderful thought ,COMMA that there could be such a thing as a best idea anybody ever had ?QUESTIONMARK 
it 's glorious ,COMMA a word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience .PERIOD 
he 's recognized as being the father of video games in europe .PERIOD 
not that you know how long number <NUM> actually is ,COMMA but you would be able to compare number <NUM> against the pantheon with number <NUM> against the baths of caracalla ,COMMA and so on and so forth .PERIOD if you were interested .PERIOD 
so as food became more plentiful ,COMMA bread became cheaper .PERIOD 
but in <NUM> ,COMMA at the height of the sub-prime and all the complicated financial structures ,COMMA it was quite opposite to the reckless risk-taking behaviors that we saw on the market .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA also there 's the placebo effect .PERIOD 
let 's go down to that dungeon .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA over the last several years i spent a lot of time in europe ,COMMA and particularly in the netherlands ,COMMA and whenever i talk about the experience economy there ,COMMA i 'm always greeted at the end with one particular question ,COMMA almost invariably .PERIOD

the name of the show is based on this story that i have to tell you about my mother .PERIOD 
as i said ,COMMA this agent is in us ,COMMA and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA here 's a curious thing ,COMMA it binds to the very place inside of your cells where oxygen binds ,COMMA and where you burn it ,COMMA and that you do this burning to live .PERIOD 
so that today ,COMMA the people living outside africa have about two and a half percent of their dna from neanderthals .PERIOD 
the answer to this question ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is an answer you 've already heard in some of the talks ,COMMA and i dare say you will hear again :COLON namely ,COMMA that our brains were evolved for a very different world than the one in which we are living .PERIOD 
there 's a potential problem that maybe this kind of shipping noise would prevent whales from being able to hear each other .PERIOD 
so the valves at the bottom of those tubes there are like radio-controlled airplane valves .PERIOD 
a trigger and the system tips over ,COMMA loses its resilience ,COMMA soft corals take over ,COMMA and we get undesired systems that can not support economic and social development .PERIOD 
some rocks are twins separated at birth .PERIOD 
and suddenly ,COMMA in this canvas of infinity ,COMMA bharat felt insignificant .PERIOD 
so here ,COMMA i think i know about where the cards are .PERIOD 
i 'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news .PERIOD 
and there was a project with ,COMMA funded by the national science foundation -- sent a bunch of scanners ,COMMA and the american libraries were supposed to send books .PERIOD 
so after we do that ,COMMA we put it into a vacuum bag ,COMMA add a little bit of seaweed ,COMMA some spices ,COMMA and we roll it ,COMMA and this starts taking on the appearance of tuna .PERIOD

by august <NUM> ,COMMA a genetic test was done ,COMMA and we knew what strain of polio shriram had .PERIOD 
this is the opera house that wagner built for himself .PERIOD

now ,COMMA this was kindly lent to me by jeff bezos ,COMMA from last year .PERIOD 
and why do i say it ?QUESTIONMARK

i read books ,COMMA science books ,COMMA especially physics .PERIOD 
unfortunately ,COMMA these beliefs are based on assumptions that do n't always hold true in many countries ,COMMA in many cultures .PERIOD 
the women in bosnia were being raped .PERIOD 
this heat map is going to show you how the brain of the system works .PERIOD

this is the first time that i can remember ,COMMA where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan ,COMMA you do n't know if you 're borrowing money from him ,COMMA or if he 's borrowing money from you .PERIOD 
i thank you .PERIOD

aaron motsoaledi ,COMMA the current health minister ,COMMA attended that concert and i had an opportunity to meet with him ,COMMA and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change ,COMMA which is absolutely necessary .PERIOD 
a state-of-the-art airplane factory rotating metal wax at fixed metal ,COMMA or you maybe melt some plastic .PERIOD a 10-billion-dollar chip fab uses a process a village artisan would recognize -- you spread stuff around and bake it .PERIOD 
ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA lennart green !EXCLAMATIONMARK lg :COLON okay ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD

one of those dark spots is madagascar ,COMMA a country which is generally better known for the dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA after lesotho ,COMMA i traveled across africa before returning to england -- so gray and depressing ,COMMA in comparison .PERIOD 
but in another sense ,COMMA it 's an incredibly complicated object that we need relatively exotic physics to describe ,COMMA and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding of the universe .PERIOD 
it 's not one of these statistics which is very doubtful .PERIOD 
i 'll tell you what to do with your fingers ,COMMA same thing .PERIOD 
i assure you ,COMMA it is very true .PERIOD 
that is ,COMMA impact is generated by people ,COMMA what they consume in their affluence ,COMMA and how it is produced .PERIOD 
what do i mean by that ?QUESTIONMARK 
a week .PERIOD

promoting recycling ,COMMA things like garden-share ,COMMA that matches up people who do n't have a garden who would like to grow food ,COMMA with people who have gardens they are n't using anymore .PERIOD 
ninety-nine percent of us have the dream of listeners .PERIOD 
ivan comes back and he says ,COMMA i want my cheese sandwich .PERIOD 
but we 're in southern california ,COMMA close to los angeles ,COMMA so i have to conclude with something focused on entertainment .PERIOD 
and i 'm not saying this is a good thing ,COMMA but this is a thing ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
but i will start with a historical background .PERIOD 
and they said they 'd spend all this time .PERIOD 
you see them on the mountains up there .PERIOD 
then come convulsions .PERIOD 
what can i do ?QUESTIONMARK 
and when people start talking about privilege ,COMMA they get paralyzed by shame .PERIOD 
you probably went out and bought them .PERIOD 
a blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task ,COMMA until now .PERIOD 
so thank you very much .PERIOD 
they were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they did n't actually love it ;SEMICOLON these were people who ran serious companies .PERIOD 
and that 's where i think organizations like ted ,COMMA like the extreme ice survey can have a terrific impact on human perception and bring us along .PERIOD 
that ,COMMA not only would it help my cousins right now ,COMMA or these people who are sending letters ,COMMA but that this content will never go old ,COMMA that it could help their kids or their grandkids .PERIOD 
it is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous .PERIOD 
so we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal-making technology there .PERIOD

this is only <NUM> galaxies .PERIOD 
the iraqi insurgent had placed the ied ,COMMA an improvised explosive device ,COMMA along the side of the road with great care .PERIOD

now that was ,COMMA ironically ,COMMA and very befittingly ,COMMA the way we found his grave .PERIOD

how does that impact our desert culture ?QUESTIONMARK 
the fraction of those that get the second replicator .PERIOD

they had other sorts of brain damage .PERIOD 
and importantly ,COMMA it 's a rich source of vitamin <NUM> .PERIOD 
notably mars ,COMMA as a first example .PERIOD 
it 's how they understand access to this culture .PERIOD 
it 's why social organization has grown from the hunter-gatherer village to the ancient state ,COMMA the empire ,COMMA and now here we are in a globalized world .PERIOD 
we see people in their twenties are the most prolific ,COMMA followed by teenagers ,COMMA and then people in their thirties ,COMMA and it dies out very quickly from there .PERIOD 
if it comes out six months late ,COMMA so what ?QUESTIONMARK 
i do n't care how you make 'em .PERIOD 
rediscover that because you 're the leaders ,COMMA the innovation leaders ,COMMA the thought leaders .PERIOD 
the world needs an international forum .PERIOD

we have <NUM> students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward .PERIOD 
when it comes to being what you say you are ,COMMA the easiest mistake that companies make is that they advertise things that they are not .PERIOD 
so this is what i was talking about ,COMMA while molding ,COMMA it 's such a great experience ,COMMA because we have freedom of like walking ,COMMA or moving my hand or ,COMMA moving around in the space ,COMMA but the moment this becomes solid ,COMMA when you can not move even an inch ,COMMA because this is plaster of paris ,COMMA so the moment you pour it it 's like liquid ;SEMICOLON but after <NUM> minutes ,COMMA it 's almost like a hard stone .PERIOD 
so here 's another example .PERIOD this one 's somewhat more somber .PERIOD 
so they are introducing new diamond shreddies .PERIOD 
ashraf ghani :COLON what scares me most is -- is you ,COMMA lack of your engagement .PERIOD 
and probably the least appreciated aspect of this is the notion that the very first time ,COMMA the very first time that you 're trying to get your brain around a new concept ,COMMA the very last thing you need is another human being saying ,COMMA do you understand this ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so where it all goes ,COMMA i do n't know .PERIOD 
they allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive ,COMMA downloaded ,COMMA streaming ,COMMA hd reality .PERIOD 
and this is -- you can see -- this is a flapping bird .PERIOD 
so here are the -- jh :COLON all right ,COMMA i 'll get out of the way here .PERIOD 
and a surprising aspect of it is that very often ,COMMA the rules of this geometry are extremely short .PERIOD 
i 'm trying to make this more available to people so that anyone can develop their own sixthsense device ,COMMA because the hardware is actually not that hard to manufacture or hard to make your own .PERIOD 
and believe me ,COMMA i lived the same sad life until about three years ago .PERIOD 
if you 're not passionate about your own company ,COMMA why on earth should anyone else be passionate ?QUESTIONMARK 
it 's very ,COMMA very different .PERIOD and it 's a memory of these very high-dimensional patterns ,COMMA like the things that come from your eyes .PERIOD

that 's great ,COMMA but that is not the whole news .PERIOD 
this family earns about one dollar per day .PERIOD 
then they 'd ask ,COMMA can you teach it at mit ?QUESTIONMARK it seems too useful ?QUESTIONMARK 
so the rhythms could be pretty intact too ,COMMA pretty concise .PERIOD 
so i 'm not going to go on until every single person in this room ,COMMA downstairs and in aspen ,COMMA and everybody else looking ,COMMA will come to love and understand classical music .PERIOD 
this is an absolutely staggering chart .PERIOD 
because it 's not anymore mom ,COMMA dad ,COMMA the flowers and the bees ,COMMA and then there 's the baby .PERIOD no ,COMMA it can be two moms ,COMMA three dads ,COMMA in-vitro -- there 's the whole idea of how babies can be made today that has changed .PERIOD 
they know mental as well as physical suffering .PERIOD 
my issues are to try to get to rescuing older citizens more completely and in larger numbers ,COMMA because i think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale -- and the same for kids .PERIOD 
if you take this thing ,COMMA you know very well it weighs very little .PERIOD 
when the molecule increases to a certain amount -- which says something about the number of cells -- it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light .PERIOD

if you 're right where the bomb went off ,COMMA you will be vaporized .PERIOD and that 's -- i 'm just telling you ,COMMA this is not good .PERIOD 
it 's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists .PERIOD 
and then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites ,COMMA they truly dominate the social media space ,COMMA which is a space that 's having a huge impact on old media .PERIOD 
but we would have lots of time ,COMMA if we see it coming .PERIOD 
and there 's a 25-dollar incubator giving that performance that had been created .PERIOD 
and there 's schools and clinics and shops .PERIOD 
and in the three years that i was finance minister ,COMMA they made an average of <NUM> million dollars profit per year .PERIOD 
i go in ,COMMA tail comes off .PERIOD 
because as we heard yesterday ,COMMA countries can lose stars from their flags ,COMMA but they can also lose press freedom ,COMMA as i guess americans among us can tell us more about .PERIOD 
she 's ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA tied in with a rope so she ca n't fall .PERIOD

it was ,COMMA which color would you like ?QUESTIONMARK 
and when he passed on ,COMMA i took this table with me and brought it to my office ,COMMA and it reminds me of him .PERIOD

this is a new generation ,COMMA a new family ,COMMA which is able to store the winds .PERIOD 
sorry ,COMMA what ?QUESTIONMARK 
we developed these novel actuators for joints .PERIOD 
but when the american parents were asked if they would rather have had the doctors make the decision ,COMMA they all said ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
what you saw after katrina is a very good indicator of how little prepared the united states is for any kind of major attack .PERIOD 
so for example ,COMMA lets sort of consider that basket cell i told you about earlier -- the one that 's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory .PERIOD 
why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm ?QUESTIONMARK

some women have those heart attacks ,COMMA but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack ,COMMA where it erodes ,COMMA does n't completely fill with clot ,COMMA symptoms are subtle ,COMMA ekg findings are different -- female-pattern .PERIOD

one of the strands of thinking i was involved in was that sameness is so incredibly overrated .PERIOD 
students love that tdp .PERIOD they think it 's the name of a video game .PERIOD

and i want to talk about the relationship between economic activity ,COMMA in particular export volume ,COMMA and hiv infections .PERIOD 
everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned ,COMMA so water will be there for seven months or nine months ,COMMA or <NUM> months .PERIOD 
we developed leonardo in collaboration with stan winston studio .PERIOD 
and i never needed eyes to see -- never .PERIOD 
and so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects .PERIOD

every day and go cook the food for the kids ,COMMA because this is what we need to do .PERIOD

consider sending somebody to nashville .PERIOD pick well .PERIOD 
i 'll explain a little bit about how it works .PERIOD 
those are from the purpose driven life .PERIOD 
and it 's only a few months since governments injected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat .PERIOD 
and evolutionary psychologists think that these intuitions have a basis in the genes .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
so looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design ,COMMA interiors and furniture ,COMMA we came up with the solution of taking an old airstream trailer and gutting it ,COMMA and trying to portray laminate ,COMMA and a trailer ,COMMA in kind of a fresh ,COMMA new contemporary look .PERIOD 
this is especially important for extroverted children too .PERIOD 
developing the skycar has been a real challenge .PERIOD

this new computer ,COMMA built to become the nerve center of a defense network ,COMMA is able to perform all the complex mathematical problems involved in countering a mass enemy raid .PERIOD

the freudian model is really one continuum that ,COMMA as you get less miserable ,COMMA you get happier .PERIOD 
if you look at management theory these days ,COMMA it used to be that our ideal leader sounded something like general patton ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK

we 'd better give you a real sound bite .PERIOD 
that puts him up there on the olympus of gangsters with the colombian cartels and the major russian crime syndicates ,COMMA but he did this for decades in the very heart of wall street ,COMMA and no regulator picked up on it .PERIOD 
one of the big problems is that for the biologists working at these sites ,COMMA it 's rather difficult to collect these animals .PERIOD 
fungi multiplied .PERIOD orchids emerged ,COMMA genitalia shaped to lure insects ... 
so if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work ,COMMA we need look only no farther than africa to find these robust self-organizing algorithms .PERIOD 
this is all about self-interest that adds up to more .PERIOD 
and that question is this .PERIOD 
now then ,COMMA you guys have -- you have a minute comeback on him to pick up a point he said ,COMMA challenge it ,COMMA whatever .PERIOD 
after all ,COMMA happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few ,COMMA but a fundamental human right for all .PERIOD 
if you have n't lost a limb -- you 've had a stroke ,COMMA for example -- you can wear these augmented limbs .PERIOD 
first of all ,COMMA i wanted to give you a good visual first impression .PERIOD 
i was very glad to see goldie hawn ,COMMA because i had an apology to make to her .PERIOD

the nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are .PERIOD 
i actually shared that with some legislators here in the u.s .PERIOD

it is the basic ,COMMA most fundamental food that we 've had in the last ten thousand years .PERIOD 
we live in one of these worlds ,COMMA and i can only show it as a sheet ,COMMA but it 's really three-dimensional .PERIOD 
these are some pictures visitors sent to me .PERIOD 
let me focus a minute on the light vehicles ,COMMA the cars and light trucks ,COMMA because we all know the most about those ;SEMICOLON probably everybody here drives one .PERIOD 
it wants only to be here tomorrow ,COMMA dressed perhaps in the sleeve of a plaid shirt ,COMMA nose pressed against the page ,COMMA writing a few more dutiful lines while i gaze out the window and imagine budapest or some other city where i have never been .PERIOD

did you see him on <NUM> minutes ,COMMA racing michael phelps in a pool -- nothing but swim trunks on -- diving in the water ,COMMA determined to beat this swimming champion ?QUESTIONMARK 
and it could potentially be something as important as tomato sauce ,COMMA or in this case ,COMMA ketchup .PERIOD 
it 's in the -- it 's in google 's search engine .PERIOD 
and in one case ,COMMA it originated on another continent .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i think that one reason that the media and the entertainment communities ,COMMA or the media community ,COMMA is driven so crazy by the tech community is that tech folks talk differently .PERIOD 
it 's like scuba diving into a coral reef ,COMMA except you 're going upward instead of downward .PERIOD 
and this man ,COMMA archie cochrane ,COMMA is a prisoner of war and a doctor ,COMMA and he has a problem .PERIOD 
guns are not a part of our lives .PERIOD 
there 's hundreds ,COMMA up to a <NUM> or <NUM> miles of dunes .PERIOD

another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what 's called neural integration .PERIOD 
we had a <NUM> presidential election decided by the supreme court .PERIOD 
and the reddit community ,COMMA really ,COMMA and the rest of the internet ,COMMA rather ,COMMA really got behind this .PERIOD 
even if you go to west africa ,COMMA you notice that market activity in west africa has always been dominated by women .PERIOD 
so i come up ,COMMA and i say ,COMMA what am i going to do today ?QUESTIONMARK i 'm not going to do what i planned to do ,COMMA and i put myself into absolute panic .PERIOD 
so you believe in the threat of climate change .PERIOD 
previously known as the department of foreign propaganda ,COMMA the state council information office is responsible for all of china 's external publicity operations .PERIOD 
now the background is -- the guy who did this is a physicist .PERIOD 
i 'm working in a museum and also a multi-use city ,COMMA because you can not have empty places during <NUM> hours a day .PERIOD 
all day he would ask many questions to his boss to learn ,COMMA to accumulate more and more knowledge ,COMMA and at night ,COMMA when no one was looking ,COMMA he 'd put his experience to practice .PERIOD 
you 've got these long instruments ,COMMA and you 're working off your centerline .PERIOD

the elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting ,COMMA they 're all losing their modular quality ,COMMA and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions .PERIOD 
and in the same token ,COMMA the solution becomes clear ,COMMA because this is n't ,COMMA therefore ,COMMA about changing human nature .PERIOD 
matching the reliability ,COMMA base load is actually irrelevant .PERIOD 
why do we want to do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is why you keep sacrificing virgins ,COMMA and why your unicorn defenses are working just great .PERIOD 
by giving kids a free school meal ,COMMA it gets them into school ,COMMA which is obviously education ,COMMA the first step out of poverty ,COMMA but it also gives them the micronutrients and the macronutrients they need to really develop both mentally and physically .PERIOD 
you might say ,COMMA eh ,COMMA that 's not really irrational .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA we know from long-term monitoring that more of these hand-raised chicks survive to adulthood and breeding age than do parent-raised chicks .PERIOD

i want to rob a bank in a film .PERIOD i want to rob a bank in a film ,COMMA but do it with a gun ,COMMA with a gun ,COMMA not with a bomb strapped around me ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
right .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA just to wrap up ,COMMA i wanted to say that it feels to me that design is about solving problems and providing elegant solutions ,COMMA and information design is about solving information problems .PERIOD 
which ,COMMA when you actually have to design a beethoven poster ,COMMA comes in handy ,COMMA because the visual information of the logo and the actual poster is exactly the same .PERIOD 
also ,COMMA when you get down there ,COMMA you find that the water is very ,COMMA very clear .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA the number one organ of ridicule nowadays ,COMMA is the newspaper .PERIOD 
we would see where we were going ,COMMA we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the suv in america .PERIOD 
now there are a lot of reasons for that .PERIOD 
i should really thank god for saving my lucky ass .PERIOD 
and though i 'm shy of <NUM> ,COMMA it captures my own experience .PERIOD 
it does n't require a tremendous thing .PERIOD 
and i still feel i 'm running ,COMMA it 's just the training to become a long-distance papercutter .PERIOD

that you are going to be here to the end .PERIOD 
there is a revolution .PERIOD

every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .PERIOD

my parents were both elected to the first parliament ,COMMA alongside nelson and winnie mandela .PERIOD they were the only other couple .PERIOD

there 's actually a scientist carefully controlling nexi 's cues to be able to study this question .PERIOD 
what happens is the world erupts in the danish cartoon controversy .PERIOD 
but some people refer to me more of -- as ,COMMA like ,COMMA an internet guru or -- swami .PERIOD

i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA what you 've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time .PERIOD

why are n't you ?QUESTIONMARK 
in the blue bar at the bottom of the graph ,COMMA it shows what her peak expiratory flow rate ,COMMA what her exhalation rate or lung health ,COMMA should be based on her age ,COMMA gender and height .PERIOD

you get an eggbeater ,COMMA which is everywhere ,COMMA and you saw off a blade ,COMMA and then you take tubing ,COMMA and you stick it on that .PERIOD you put the blood in ,COMMA you spin it -- somebody sits there and spins it .PERIOD 
even goldman sachs once used to serve clients ,COMMA before it turned into an institution that serves only itself .PERIOD 
so it turns out that google is a compassionate company ,COMMA because googlers found compassion to be fun .PERIOD 
actually the country with more telephones is the soviet union ,COMMA and the data referred to <NUM> .PERIOD 
and how much clout could they bring to bear if they chose to engage on the issue ?QUESTIONMARK 
really not a very sensible thing to do .PERIOD

juan ?QUESTIONMARK no !EXCLAMATIONMARK johannes ,COMMA not juan .PERIOD 
if you 're more interested ,COMMA we have a basking shark website now just set up .PERIOD 
but the poorer countries in africa ,COMMA the low-income countries down here ,COMMA there the rates fall faster ,COMMA of the percentage infected ,COMMA because people still die .PERIOD

we can learn by watching other people and copying or imitating what they can do .PERIOD 
the speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large ;SEMICOLON it must be embedded in dark matter .PERIOD

we need to put money where it can productively grow .PERIOD

that 's what the sisters said ,COMMA he was fine .PERIOD

it 's a very ,COMMA very strong force .PERIOD 
she saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add around the edges was always going to grow by two ,COMMA so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there .PERIOD 
and i kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture ,COMMA or something of that nature ,COMMA and i could n't get away from it .PERIOD 
i 'll quickly play a short part of the air ,COMMA and then i 'm going to get into kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult to play when you 're not warmed up ,COMMA so ,COMMA if i mess it up ,COMMA pretend you like it anyway .PERIOD it 's called the banks .PERIOD

that is ,COMMA as long as you can keep net neutrality in place .PERIOD

i had more than <NUM> surgeries .PERIOD 
the best collaboration ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is with children .PERIOD

at that point ,COMMA i became a little more ambitious and decided to see what else could children do with a computer .PERIOD 
getting a little more technical now .PERIOD 
and i could make the same points about the united states and the united nations .PERIOD 
so that 's great .PERIOD so that was too easy .PERIOD 
woman :COLON that 's why i use enough masking tape .PERIOD 
we thought everyone could participate .PERIOD 
this is my office .PERIOD it 's out there .PERIOD 
that 's about it .PERIOD 
and so this notion of using role-play -- or in this case ,COMMA living through the experience as a way of creating empathy -- particularly when you use video ,COMMA is really powerful .PERIOD 
i mean three companies providing cybersecurity services to the fbi have been hacked .PERIOD 
and it 's healthier than the united states .PERIOD 
there 's two spheres and they 're separated in distance .PERIOD 
so it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy ,COMMA and lots of viruses were coming along .PERIOD 
and the landscape was always made by this sort of weird ,COMMA uneasy collaboration between nature and man .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA i 've never found anybody that does n't like the light that goes out slowly .PERIOD

it has a thumbs-up and a thumbs-down .PERIOD

they told her she could n't love her vagina in high school ,COMMA that it was not a legal thing ,COMMA that it was not a moral thing ,COMMA that it was not a good thing .PERIOD

so einstein told a story and followed his stories and came up with theories and came up with theories and then came up with his equations .PERIOD 
this is a beefalo .PERIOD 
but then i 'm going to slowly turn down the heat ,COMMA so to speak ,COMMA and then there 's this viability threshold where now it would be possible for a replicator to actually live .PERIOD 
you can take a data set and put it there .PERIOD

they 're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there -- they 're just examples of technologies that are in each one of these periods .PERIOD 
this is slowed down 20-fold ,COMMA and the crab just zooms across that simulated debris .PERIOD

for those of you who are from new york ,COMMA this is <NUM> street under the west side highway .PERIOD

he 's really modest ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor .PERIOD 
we have about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA <NUM> places that are not worth caring about in the united states today .PERIOD 
so i spent a long time .PERIOD 
preserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest i think is absolutely critical for human health .PERIOD

the company went public two years later and is today one of the best known companies in the world .PERIOD

the nitrogen has two problems .PERIOD

its mission is as good as you could get .PERIOD 
will i not make enough money ?QUESTIONMARK 
as i walked out ,COMMA her pace slowed .PERIOD

and it 's a straight-jacket .PERIOD 
and the answer is :COLON no ,COMMA not really ;SEMICOLON we use a machine shop .PERIOD

and there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other .PERIOD 
i 've written books about the history of space ,COMMA the history of physics and religion ,COMMA and i write articles for people like the new york times and the l.a. times .PERIOD 
and that 's because everest is so high ,COMMA it 's in the jet stream ,COMMA and winds are constantly scouring the face ,COMMA so no snow gets to accumulate .PERIOD 
they went out and where shriram lives ,COMMA they vaccinated two million people .PERIOD 
but at the same time ,COMMA we were concerned that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else 's car ,COMMA it might not turn out the same way -- she might get shot for that .PERIOD 
so it was a little slow ?QUESTIONMARK 
what blew their mind was the first one took place in india ,COMMA it was the party of a hindu god .PERIOD 
and the happy result .PERIOD 
so you have to know ,COMMA looking into the eyes of lions and leopards right now ,COMMA it is all about critical awareness .PERIOD 
i think the first one is that they got fooled by history .PERIOD 
because ,COMMA if that hypothesis were to be true ,COMMA it would have massive repercussions in our understanding of what 's causing the many different aspects of the autism phenotype .PERIOD

i 'm doing <NUM> meals a day and i 've been doing it for two years ,COMMA trying to change how we feed kids in america .PERIOD

objectivity basically is constructed in that same s & amp ;SEMICOLON m way .PERIOD 
you might also be asking whether it 's possible that this is illegal for her to do this .PERIOD 
now i should confess that as [ far as ] i 'm concerned this would be an abomination if it emitted not one particle of carbon .PERIOD

access to credit must be a human right .PERIOD 
what we 're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you ,COMMA in the hopes of making you more healthy ,COMMA making those conversations better ,COMMA so bacteria can do things that we want them to do better than they would be on their own .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our encoder and transducer .PERIOD 
but i also hope ,COMMA because i think the people in this room can literally change the world ,COMMA i hope you take some of this stuff away with you ,COMMA and when you have an opportunity to be influential ,COMMA that you try to get some heavy-duty money spent on some of these ideas .PERIOD 
it 's a fact .PERIOD 
how much do i stand to gain from cheating ?QUESTIONMARK

carbon at the nanoscale is actually transparent and flexible .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA you say ,COMMA if paper is a good idea ,COMMA other people have surely thought of it .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i made a deal with the women .PERIOD i said ,COMMA look ,COMMA we get rid of the charity side ,COMMA and we run this as a business and i 'll help you .PERIOD 
and some of the most heartrending emails that i get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout ,COMMA pleading with me to write to their parents ,COMMA to help them slow down ,COMMA to help them get off this full-throttle treadmill .PERIOD 
save more tomorrow invites employees to save more maybe next year -- sometime in the future when we can imagine ourselves eating bananas ,COMMA volunteering more in the community ,COMMA exercising more and doing all the right things on the planet .PERIOD 
and we intercut it with ,COMMA we are the premier science university in the world ,COMMA because of british-like hubris .PERIOD 
we have a big problem .PERIOD 
i 'm earthed in my essence ,COMMA and my self is suspended .PERIOD 
as an indian ,COMMA and now as a politician and a government minister ,COMMA i 've become rather concerned about the hype we 're hearing about our own country ,COMMA all this talk about india becoming a world leader ,COMMA even the next superpower .PERIOD

my colleagues in infra-red astronomy call minus <NUM> kelvin is cool for them .PERIOD

today 's event you might call how mountains teach .PERIOD 
we certainly saw that in <NUM> .PERIOD 
i want ,COMMA really ,COMMA to think about the fact that saving four times more is a huge difference in terms of the lifestyle that people will be able to afford .PERIOD 
but we know that art imitates life ,COMMA and it turns out nature ,COMMA three million years ago ,COMMA evolved the next animal .PERIOD 
in a primitive and simple world ,COMMA there 's really no reason for a model because feeling is close to reality .PERIOD

we 've solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today .PERIOD 
you can not talk to everybody all the time .PERIOD

and you can see a little bit of double helix forming there .PERIOD 
a range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now ,COMMA like greed .PERIOD 
she gave a shot of her chloroquine -- what i learned was the chloroquine then -- gave her some -- it must have been a re-hydration -- and some other therapies ,COMMA and put us in a corner .PERIOD 
so there was no job ,COMMA no food .PERIOD

and we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted .PERIOD 
and since we 've already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways ,COMMA i thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try to relate it to the military context .PERIOD 
so it holds onto the very last point .PERIOD 
the gap between shanghai and the united kingdom and the united states is as big as the gap between the u.k. and the u.s .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA i pushed all the theories that i had on story at the time to the limits of my understanding on this project .PERIOD 
i do n't think that whether or not you 're getting a compliment should be the test of something 's value ,COMMA but i think in the case of a fashion item ,COMMA an article of clothing ,COMMA that 's a reasonable benchmark .PERIOD 
his employees are inspired by the effort .PERIOD 
just to give you an example ,COMMA every single root apex is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least <NUM> different chemical and physical parameters .PERIOD

these are when .PERIOD 
here we go .PERIOD once again the usa is part of the reason here .PERIOD

the project launched in april <NUM> .PERIOD 
and it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall ,COMMA because if we made it in a way that it would topple over ,COMMA then it would damage itself ,COMMA and if it did n't fall enough ,COMMA it would n't instill that fatalism ,COMMA or that sense of wanting to go and help it .PERIOD 
and while the political right may moralize sex much more ,COMMA the political left is really doing a lot of it with food .PERIOD 
one is called reln -- it 's involved in early developmental cues .PERIOD 
it 's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints a real opportunity to put water where it 's critically needed ,COMMA into these degraded ecosystems ,COMMA while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice about how their water is used .PERIOD 
and that allows us to understand who 's doing it well ,COMMA and call them out ,COMMA and find out what those techniques are .PERIOD 
we could ,COMMA of course ,COMMA buy more efficiency .PERIOD 
and the good news about all of this is that the scientists who 've been studying motivation have given us this new approach .PERIOD 
i think we 're all in this room ,COMMA probably ,COMMA because we know that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next <NUM> years ,COMMA where the food import bill is now double what it was <NUM> years ago ,COMMA where food production per capita has stagnated ,COMMA and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased .PERIOD

other views are also available .PERIOD 
i 'm trying to develop homegrown solutions to our issues because we realize that people from outside can come and help us ,COMMA but if we do n't help ourselves ,COMMA there 's nothing we can do .PERIOD

now if we make some guesses about how long homo erectus lived ,COMMA what their generation time was ,COMMA that 's about <NUM> generations of parents to offspring ,COMMA and other individuals watching ,COMMA in which that hand axe did n't change .PERIOD 
you will have seen something like this -- this is the reverse effect .PERIOD 
then they ship them off ,COMMA hundreds of miles away to hard-line schools that run along the taliban agenda .PERIOD 
so why do n't you do that now ?QUESTIONMARK 
and the adage that i 'm referring to ,COMMA that applied at that time ,COMMA was that nothing comes down faster than a vtol aircraft upside down .PERIOD 
because when we buy a car we go to the dealer once ,COMMA we have an interaction ,COMMA and we 're chow -- usually as quickly as possible .PERIOD 
after having spent more than a decade understanding ,COMMA studying ,COMMA and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with africa 's agricultural markets ,COMMA i decided it was time to do something about it .PERIOD 
behavioral finance has a long way .PERIOD 
this is another way that our mind was shifted ,COMMA and twitter was n't what we thought it was .PERIOD 
so we 've talked about the static face and judging the static face ,COMMA but actually ,COMMA we 're more comfortable with judging the moving face .PERIOD 
and were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week ,COMMA these crows ,COMMA whenever these particular students walked around campus ,COMMA these crows would caw at them ,COMMA and run around and make their life kind of miserable .PERIOD 
and this is why i like to talk about this ,COMMA because if we do n't acknowledge it ,COMMA then the transition will be pretty painful .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA they will also defecate in certain areas .PERIOD 
during that time ,COMMA health and safety has become everything about my job .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA these transcend age ,COMMA race ,COMMA culture ,COMMA gender .PERIOD 
imagine you 're learning to play tennis and you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce as it comes over the net towards you .PERIOD 
and with the new generation of scanning tools ,COMMA for the first time we can actually see individual inter-neural fibers and see them processing and signaling in real time -- but then the question is ,COMMA ok ,COMMA we can get this data now ,COMMA but can we understand it ?QUESTIONMARK 
redistribution markets ,COMMA just like swaptree ,COMMA are when you take a used ,COMMA or pre-owned ,COMMA item and move it from where it 's not needed to somewhere ,COMMA or someone ,COMMA where it is .PERIOD

now ,COMMA the other thing that fashion designers have done to survive in this culture of copying is they 've learned how to copy themselves .PERIOD 
you 're worming your way through branches which are crowded with living things that do n't occur near the ground .PERIOD 
because that is what knopf is .PERIOD 
they 're actually developing a lot of their science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world in our system and they 're also trying to develop all of their software tools completely open-source .PERIOD 
they 're controlled by different parts of the brain .PERIOD

for example ,COMMA these tuna that were once so abundant in the north sea are now effectively gone .PERIOD 
galaxies form ,COMMA and generations of stars form in those galaxies ,COMMA and around one star ,COMMA at least one star ,COMMA is a habitable planet .PERIOD

where does such rage come from ?QUESTIONMARK

this is technology ,COMMA entertainment ,COMMA design and there 's a dairy cow .PERIOD 
we were getting quite a few caught in surface drift nets .PERIOD

you can put these things away ,COMMA and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule ,COMMA at your own time ,COMMA when you 're available ,COMMA when you 're ready to go again .PERIOD

so i would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves .PERIOD 
they can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing ,COMMA and it 's going to improve the local soil .PERIOD 
in addition to accurate language training it also fixes memory and cognition speech fluency and speech production .PERIOD 
i wanted to put heart and soul and people ,COMMA your public ,COMMA around the statistics that we 've become so used to .PERIOD 
and that 's what all good stories should do at the beginning ,COMMA is they should give you a promise .PERIOD 
so we have here ,COMMA this couple .PERIOD 
this is what it 's about .PERIOD 
i do n't have time to get into all this ,COMMA but if you want to understand how a brain works ,COMMA you have to understand how the first part of the mammalian neocortex works ,COMMA how it is we store patterns and make predictions .PERIOD 
we can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics .PERIOD 
and that should save over two thirds of the lives if it 's effective .PERIOD 
so what did i learn from this intense and unforgettable experience ?QUESTIONMARK 
that 's a good question ,COMMA and we ask ourselves that every day .PERIOD 
people will send you donations when you 're in that condition .PERIOD 
this is the real secret stuff :COLON how to get directed energy explosions so you 're sending the energy of a nuclear explosion -- not like just a stick of dynamite ,COMMA but you 're directing it at the ship .PERIOD 
is this business about appearance and preoccupation with it a western phenomenon ?QUESTIONMARK

and at last ,COMMA we appear to be doing something about it .PERIOD 
africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders .PERIOD 
and i try to live in beautiful places .PERIOD 
we were evolved in an era where it was n't in the interests of people at the age of most people at this conference ,COMMA like myself ,COMMA to live much longer ,COMMA because we were using up the precious resources which were better deployed towards the children and those caring for them .PERIOD 
a guy who 's added it up all this very well is david mackay ,COMMA a physicist in england ,COMMA and in his wonderful book ,COMMA sustainable energy ,COMMA among other things ,COMMA he says ,COMMA i 'm not trying to be pro-nuclear .PERIOD i 'm just pro-arithmetic .PERIOD

one approach is to look at patients who had lesions in different part of the brain ,COMMA and study changes in their behavior .PERIOD 
there 's the availability heuristic ,COMMA which basically means we estimate the probability of something by how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind .PERIOD

and this gets shown in art galleries like this ,COMMA as a sequence .PERIOD 
it 's called the great western railway .PERIOD 
it 's to have a look at different worlds .PERIOD 
what it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language .PERIOD

suffice to say it 's like -- it 's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming .PERIOD 
their specialty was the philosophy of consciousness .PERIOD

in the case of the vikings -- in greenland ,COMMA the climate got colder in the late <NUM> ,COMMA and especially in the <NUM> .PERIOD but a cold climate is n't necessarily fatal ,COMMA because the inuit -- the eskimos inhabiting greenland at the same time -- did better ,COMMA rather than worse ,COMMA with cold climates .PERIOD so why did n't the greenland norse as well ?QUESTIONMARK 
five years ago ,COMMA <NUM> million children were born -- so ,COMMA more -- and less than <NUM> million of them died before the age of five .PERIOD

we do n't need a reason .PERIOD

issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet .PERIOD 
i want to talk to you today a little bit about predictable irrationality .PERIOD

mahmoud was going to be discharged with his new legs .PERIOD

some people have a better musical ability and ability to appreciate music than others have .PERIOD 
on the israeli side ,COMMA there is a new peace movement called solidariot ,COMMA which means solidarity in hebrew .PERIOD

we take an idea ,COMMA combine it with a square ,COMMA and you get an origami figure .PERIOD 
i admit that i 'm very grateful for all the medical advances that have kept me in relatively good health all these years .PERIOD

what does that mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
you see here a little video .PERIOD

ten million out of <NUM> million we will add between now and then .PERIOD 
we 'll loop around here in just a second ,COMMA and you 'll see another one .PERIOD

we have this incredible excess capacity .PERIOD 
i did these conference calls .PERIOD i did all this stuff .PERIOD 
we can zip through them as a possibility .PERIOD 
and we 're getting to that .PERIOD 
now this is being augmented with further layers of technology like augmented reality .PERIOD 
that 's how distant we are from even meeting an air force willing to fly against ours .PERIOD 
but if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene ,COMMA maybe we 'll feel sick .PERIOD 
you say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA ok. and a z.q .PERIOD score is adjusted to age ,COMMA and you want to get as high as you possibly can .PERIOD

taniyama tried and tried and tried and he could never prove that it was true .PERIOD 
now why would this kind of fetal learning be useful ?QUESTIONMARK

and that 's why designers ,COMMA more and more ,COMMA are working on behaviors rather than on objects .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA naturally ,COMMA you decide to row across the pacific .PERIOD 
and sound places us in time as well ,COMMA because sound always has time embedded in it .PERIOD

no ,COMMA i do n't have a badge .PERIOD 
when president obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector ,COMMA we went from <NUM> landlines to <NUM> million gsm lines ,COMMA and counting .PERIOD 
what i wanted to show you is that scientists ,COMMA using their from-the-outside ,COMMA third-person methods ,COMMA can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of ,COMMA and that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA you 're not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are .PERIOD 
one is people need a guarantee they wo n't be evicted .PERIOD

and i knocked on the door ,COMMA and hyun-sook answered the door ,COMMA and her eyes were bloodshot ,COMMA and she seemed to be in shock .PERIOD 
and what a perfect place to do that ,COMMA at ted .PERIOD 
and i just love learning and i 'm incredibly inquisitive and i love taking on ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the status quo and trying to turn it upside down .PERIOD 
and the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you 've seen dogs and pigs on leashes .PERIOD 
j :COLON how many months pregnant are you ?QUESTIONMARK 
is this science fiction ?QUESTIONMARK no ,COMMA because i 'm wearing the first application of this technology .PERIOD

bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that 's available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like nelson .PERIOD
